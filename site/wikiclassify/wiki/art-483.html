				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; His productions there were entitled ''Gas Masks,'' ''Listen Moscow,'' and ''[[Enough Stupidity in Every Wise Man|Wiseman]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|pp=46‚Äì48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 Eisenstein began his career as a theorist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; by writing ''The Montage of Attractions'' for [[LEF (journal)|LEF]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Christie|Taylor|1994|pp=87‚Äì89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenstein's first film, ''[[Glumov's Diary]]'' (for the theatre production ''[[Enough Stupidity in Every Wise Man|Wiseman]]''), was also made in that same year with [[Dziga Vertov]] hired initially as an &quot;instructor</span>

				<span class='text'>''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1925) was acclaimed critically worldwide</span>
				<span class='text'>It was mostly his international critical renown which enabled Eisenstein to direct ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|October]]'' (aka ''Ten Days That Shook The World'') as part of a grand tenth anniversary celebration of the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, and then ''[[The General Line]]'' (aka ''Old and New'')</span>
				<span class='text'>The critics of the outside world praised them, but at home, Eisenstein's focus in these films on structural issues such as camera angles, crowd movements, and [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] brought him and like-minded others, such as [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] and [[Alexander Dovzhenko]], under fire from the Soviet film community, forcing him to issue public articles of self-criticism and commitments to reform his cinematic visions to conform to the increasingly specific doctrines of [[socialist realism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}===Travels to Europe===In the autumn of 1928, with ''October'' still under fire in many Soviet quarters, Eisenstein left the Soviet Union for a tour of Europe, accompanied by his perennial film collaborator [[Grigori Aleksandrov]] and cinematographer [[Eduard Tisse]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Officially, the trip was supposed to allow Eisenstein and company to learn about sound motion pictures and to present the famous Soviet artists in person to the capitalist West</span>
				<span class='text'>For Eisenstein, however, it was also an opportunity to see landscapes and cultures outside those found within the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent the next two years touring and lecturing in Berlin, Zurich, London, and Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eisenstein|1972|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, in Switzerland, Eisenstein supervised an educational documentary about abortion directed by Tiss√© entitled ''[[Frauennot - Frauengl√ºck]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bordwell|1993| p= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;===American projects===In late April 1930, [[Jesse L</span>
				<span class='text'>Lasky]], on behalf of [[Paramount Pictures]], offered Eisenstein the opportunity to make a film in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He accepted a short-term contract for $100,000 and arrived in [[Hollywood]] in May 1930</span>
				<span class='text'>isenstein proposed a biography of munitions tycoon [[Sir Basil Zaharoff]] and a film version of ''[[Arms and the Man]]'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]], and more fully developed plans for a film of ''[[Sutter's Gold]]'' by [[Jack London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Montagu|1968|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on all accounts failed to impress the studio's producers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paramount then proposed a movie version of [[Theodore Dreiser]]'s ''[[An American Tragedy]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; This excited Eisenstein, who had read and liked the work, and had met Dreiser at one time in Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>Eisenstein completed a script by the start of October 1930,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Montagu|1968|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Paramount disliked it completely and, additionally, found themselves intimidated by [[Frank Pease|Major Frank Pease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; president of the ''Hollywood Technical Director's Institute''</span>
				<span class='text'>Pease, an anti-communist, mounted a public campaign against Eisenstein</span>
				<span class='text'>On October 23, 1930, by &quot;mutual consent,&quot; Paramount and Eisenstein declared their contract null and void, and the Eisenstein party were treated to return tickets to Moscow at Paramount's expense</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|pp=185‚Äì186}}&lt;/ref&gt;Eisenstein was thus faced with returning home a failure</span>
				<span class='text'>The Soviet film industry was solving the sound-film issue without him and his films, techniques, and theories were becoming increasingly attacked as 'ideological failures' and prime examples of [[Formalist film theory|formalism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of his theoretical articles from this period, such as ''[[Eisenstein on Disney]]'', have surfaced decades later as seminal scholarly texts used as curriculum in film schools around the world</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}Eisenstein and his entourage spent considerable time with [[Charlie Chaplin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Montagu|1968|pp=89‚Äì97}}&lt;/ref&gt; who recommended that Eisenstein meet with a sympathetic benefactor in the person of American socialist author [[Upton Sinclair]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinclair's works had been accepted by and were widely read in the USSR, and were known to Eisenstein</span>
				<span class='text'>The two had mutual admiration and between the end of October 1930 and Thanksgiving of that year, Sinclair had secured an extension of Eisenstein's absences from the USSR, and permission for him to travel to Mexico</span>
				<span class='text'>The trip to Mexico was for Eisenstein to make a film produced by Sinclair and his wife, [[Mary Craig Sinclair|Mary Craig Kimbrough Sinclair]], and three other investors organized as the &quot;Mexican Film Trust&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>gv|thumb|250px|Sergei Eisenstein visiting [[Rotterdam]] in 1930</span>
				<span class='text'>]On November 24, 1930, Eisenstein signed a contract with the Trust &quot;upon the basis of his desire to be free to direct the making of a picture according to his own ideas of what a Mexican picture should be, and in full faith in Eisenstein's artistic integrity</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract also stipulated that the film would be &quot;non-political,&quot; that immediately available funding came from Mary Sinclair in an amount of &quot;not less than Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars,&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Geduld &amp; Gottesman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>22&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the shooting schedule amounted to &quot;a period of from three to four months,&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Geduld &amp; Gottesman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>22&quot; /&gt; and most importantly that &quot;Eisenstein furthermore agrees that all pictures made or directed by him in Mexico, all negative film and positive prints, and all story and ideas embodied in said Mexican picture, will be the property of Mrs</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reportedly, it was verbally clarified that the expectation was for a finished film of about an hour's duration</span>
				<span class='text'>y 4 December, Eisenstein was en route to Mexico by train, accompanied by Aleksandrov and Tisse</span>
				<span class='text'>Later he produced a brief synopsis of the six-part film which would come, in one form or another, to be the final plan Eisenstein would settle on for his project</span>
				<span class='text'>The title for the project, ''[[¬°Que viva M√©xico!]]'', was decided on some time later still</span>
				<span class='text'>While in Mexico Eisenstein mixed socially with [[Frida Kahlo]] and [[Diego Rivera]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Eisenstein admired these artists and Mexican culture in general, and they inspired Eisenstein to call his films &quot;moving frescoes&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=513}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under pressure, Eisenstein blamed Mary Sinclair's younger brother, Hunter Kimbrough, who had been sent along to act as a line producer, for the film's problems</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenstein hoped to pressure the Sinclairs to insinuate themselves between him and Stalin, so Eisenstein could finish the film in his own way</span>
				<span class='text'>The furious Sinclairs shut down production and ordered Kimbrough to return to the United States with the remaining film footage and the three Soviets to see what they could do with the film already shot, estimates ranging from 170,000 lineal feet with ''Soldadera'' unfilmed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eisenstein|1972|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; to an excess of 250,000 lineal feet</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;For the unfinished filming of the &quot;novel&quot; of ''Soldadera'', without incurring any cost, Eisenstein had secured 500 soldiers, 10,000 guns, and 50 cannons from the Mexican Army,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; but this was lost due to Sinclair's cancelling of production</span>
				<span class='text'>When Eisenstein arrived at the American border, a customs search of his trunk revealed sketches and drawings of [[Jesus]] caricatures amongst other lewd pornographic material</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|pp=234‚Äì235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|pp=309‚Äì310}}&lt;/ref&gt; His re-entry visa had expired,&lt;ref name=&quot;Geduld &amp; Gottesman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>288&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Geduld|Gottesman|1970|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sinclair's contacts in Washington were unable to secure him an additional extension</span>
				<span class='text'>Eisenstein, Aleksandrov, and Tisse were allowed, after a month's stay at the [[U</span>

				<span class='text'>288&quot;/&gt; and thence depart for Moscow, while Kimbrough returned to Los Angeles with the remaining film</span>
				<span class='text'>isenstein toured the American South, on his way to New York</span>
				<span class='text'>In mid-1932, the Sinclairs were able to secure the services of [[Sol Lesser]], who had just opened his distribution office in New York, Principal Distributing Corporation</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leyda|1960|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;The thing which appeared to save Eisenstein's career at this point was that Stalin ended up taking the position that the ''Bezhin Meadow'' catastrophe, along with several other problems facing the industry at that point, had less to do with Eisenstein's approach to filmmaking as with the executives who were supposed to have been supervising him</span>
				<span class='text'>Ultimately this came down on the shoulders of [[Boris Shumyatsky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;executive producer&quot; of Soviet film since 1932, who in early 1938 was denounced, arrested, tried and convicted as a traitor, and shot</span>
				<span class='text'>(The production executive at Film studio [[Mosfilm]], where Meadow was being made, was also replaced, but without further executions</span>
				<span class='text'> {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}===Comeback===Eisenstein was thence able to ingratiate himself with Stalin for 'one more chance', and he chose, from two offerings, the assignment of a biopic of ''[[Alexander Nevsky (film)|Alexander Nevsky]],'' with music composed by [[Sergei Prokofiev]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This time, he was assigned a co-scenarist, [[Pyotr Pavlenko]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Bordwell, p</span>
				<span class='text'>27&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bordwell|1993|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; to bring in a completed script; professional actors to play the roles; and an assistant director, [[Dmitri Ivanovich Vasilyev|Dmitri Vasilyev]], to expedite shooting</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Bordwell, p</span>
				<span class='text'>27&quot; /&gt;The result was a film critically received by both the Soviets and in the West, which won him the [[Order of Lenin]] and the [[Stalin Prize]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bordwell, p</span>
				<span class='text'>28&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bordwell|1993|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an obvious allegory and stern warning against the massing forces of Nazi Germany, well played and well made</span>
				<span class='text'>The script had Nevsky utter a number of traditional Russian [[proverb]]s, verbally rooting his fight against the Germanic invaders in Russian traditions</span>

				<span class='text'>ithin months of its release, Stalin entered into a [[Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact|pact]] with Hitler, and ''Nevsky'' was promptly pulled from distribution</span>
				<span class='text'>Eisenstein returned to teaching and was assigned to direct [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Walk√ºre]]'' at the [[Bolshoi Theatre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bordwell, p</span>
				<span class='text'>28&quot; /&gt; After the outbreak of war with Germany in 1941, ''Nevsky'' was re-released into wide distribution and earned international success</span>
				<span class='text'>With the war approaching Moscow, Eisenstein was one of many filmmakers evacuated to [[Almaty|Alma-Ata]], where he first considered the idea of making a film about Czar Ivan IV</span>
				<span class='text'>Eisenstein corresponded with Prokofiev from Alma Ata, and was joined by him there in 1942</span>
				<span class='text'>Prokofiev composed [[Ivan the Terrible (Prokofiev)|the score]] for Eisenstein's film and Eisenstein reciprocated by designing sets for an operatic rendition of ''[[War and Peace (Prokofiev)|War and Peace]]'' that Prokofiev was developing</span>

				<span class='text'>All footage from the still incomplete ''[[Ivan The Terrible|Ivan The Terrible, Part III]]'' was confiscated, and most of it was destroyed&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leyda|Voynow|1982|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; (though several filmed scenes still exist today)</span>
				<span class='text'>isenstein's health was also failing: he was struck by a [[heart attack]] during the making of this picture, and soon died of another at the age of 50</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neuberger|2003|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was found on the floor of his Moscow flat on the morning of February 11, 1948</span>

				<span class='text'>He and his contemporary, [[Lev Kuleshov]], two of the earliest film theorists, argued that montage was the essence of the cinema</span>
				<span class='text'>His articles and books&amp;nbsp;‚Äî particularly ''Film Form'' and ''The Film Sense''&amp;nbsp;‚Äî explain the significance of montage in detail</span>
				<span class='text'>is writings and films have continued to have a major impact on subsequent filmmakers</span>
				<span class='text'>Eisenstein believed that editing could be used for more than just expounding a scene or moment, through a &quot;linkage&quot; of related images</span>
				<span class='text'>Eisenstein felt the &quot;collision&quot; of shots could be used to manipulate the emotions of the audience and create film metaphors</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed that an idea should be derived from the juxtaposition of two independent shots, bringing an element of collage into film</span>
				<span class='text'>He developed what he called &quot;methods of montage&quot;:#Metric&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenstein|1949|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;#Rhythmic&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenstein|1949|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;#Tonal&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenstein|1949|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;#Overtonal&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenstein|1949|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;#Intellectual&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenstein|1949|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;Eisenstein taught film-making during his career at GIK where he wrote the curricula for the directors' course;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nizhniƒ≠|1962|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; his classroom illustrations are reproduced in Vladimir Nizhniƒ≠'s ''Lessons with Eisenstein</span>
				<span class='text'>' Exercises and examples for students were based on rendering literature such as [[Honor√© de Balzac]]'s ''[[Le P√®re Goriot]]</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nizhniƒ≠|1962|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothetical was the staging of the [[Haiti]]an struggle for independence as depicted in Anatolii Vinogradov's ''The Black Consul,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nizhniƒ≠|1962|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced as well by John Vandercook's ''Black Majesty</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leyda|Voynow|1982|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;Lessons from this scenario delved into the character of [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], replaying his movements, actions, and the drama surrounding him</span>
				<span class='text'>Further to the didactics of literary and dramatic content, Eisenstein taught the technicalities of directing, photography, and editing, while encouraging his students' development of individuality, expressiveness, and creativity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nizhniƒ≠|1962|pp=148‚Äì155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenstein's pedagogy, like his films, were politically charged and contained quotes from [[Vladimir Lenin]] interwoven with his teaching</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nizhniƒ≠|1962|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;In his initial films, Eisenstein did not use professional actors</span>
				<span class='text'>His narratives eschewed individual characters and addressed broad social issues, especially [[class conflict]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He used stock characters, and the roles were filled with untrained people from the appropriate classes; he avoided casting [[Movie star|stars]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Seton|1952|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenstein's vision of [[communism]] brought him into conflict with officials in the ruling regime of [[Joseph Stalin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Like many [[Bolshevik]] artists, Eisenstein envisioned a new society which would subsidize artists totally,{{cn|date=October 2015}} freeing them from the confines of bosses and budgets, leaving them absolutely free to create, but budgets and producers were as significant to the Soviet film industry as the rest of the world</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to the fledgling war, the revolution-wracked and isolated new nation didn't have the resources to nationalize its film industry at first</span>
				<span class='text'>When it did, limited resources&amp;nbsp;‚Äî both monetary and equipment&amp;nbsp;‚Äî required production controls as extensive as in the capitalist world</span>
