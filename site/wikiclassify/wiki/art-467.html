				<span class='text'>The episode is unusual in his body of work, in that the camerawork is more highly stylized than his later, more &quot;mature&quot; films</span>
				<span class='text'>After this, and an episode of ''[[Marcus Welby, M</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>]'', Spielberg got his first feature-length assignment: an episode of ''[[The Name of the Game (TV series)|The Name of the Game]]'' called &quot;[[L</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>2017]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>This futuristic science fiction episode impressed Universal Studios and they signed him to a short contract</span>
				<span class='text'>He did another segment on ''Night Gallery'' and did some work for shows such as ''[[Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law]]'' and ''The Psychiatrist'', before landing the first series episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'' (previous episodes were actually TV films)</span>
				<span class='text'>ased on the strength of his work, Universal signed Spielberg to do four TV films</span>
				<span class='text'>The first was a [[Richard Matheson]] adaptation called ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The film is about a psychotic [[Peterbilt 281]] [[tanker truck]] driver who chases the terrified driver ([[Dennis Weaver]]) of a small [[Plymouth Valiant]] and tries to run him off the road</span>
				<span class='text'>Special praise of this film by the influential British critic [[Dilys Powell]] was highly significant to Spielberg's career</span>
				<span class='text'>Another TV film (''[[Something Evil]]'') was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film</span>
				<span class='text'>He fulfilled his contract by directing the TV film-length pilot of a show called ''Savage'', starring [[Martin Landau]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Spielberg's debut full-length feature film was ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'', about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby</span>
				<span class='text'>Spielberg's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers, and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated that &quot;a major new director is on the horizon</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=McBride/&gt;{{rp|223}} However, the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release</span>
				<span class='text'>tudio producers [[Richard D</span>
				<span class='text'>Zanuck]] and [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] offered Spielberg the director's chair for ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', a thriller-horror film based on the [[Peter Benchley]] novel [[Jaws (novel)|about an enormous killer shark]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Spielberg has often referred to the gruelling shoot as his professional crucible</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the film's ultimate, enormous success, it was nearly shut down due to delays and budget over-runs</span>
				<span class='text'>But Spielberg persevered and finished the film</span>
				<span class='text'>It was an enormous hit, winning three Academy Awards (for editing, original score and sound) and grossing more than $470&amp;nbsp;million worldwide at the box office</span>
				<span class='text'>It also set the domestic record for box office gross, leading to what the press described as &quot;Jawsmania</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=McBride/&gt;{{rp|248}} ''Jaws'' made Spielberg a household name and one of America's youngest multi-millionaires, allowing him a great deal of autonomy for his future projects</span>

				<span class='text'>One of the rare films both written and directed by Spielberg, ''Close Encounters'' was a critical and box office hit, giving Spielberg his first Best Director nomination from the Academy as well as earning six other [[Academy Awards]] nominations</span>
				<span class='text'>It won Oscars in two categories (Cinematography, [[Vilmos Zsigmond]], and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing, Frank E</span>
				<span class='text'>Warner)</span>
				<span class='text'>This second blockbuster helped to secure Spielberg's rise</span>
				<span class='text'>His next film, ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'', a big-budgeted World War II farce, was not nearly as successful and though it grossed over $92</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;million worldwide (and did make a small profit for co-producing studios Columbia and Universal) it was seen as a disappointment, mainly with the critics</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Spielberg then revisited his ''Close Encounters'' project and, with financial backing from Columbia Pictures, released ''Close Encounters: The Special Edition'' in 1980</span>
				<span class='text'>For this, Spielberg fixed some of the flaws he thought impeded the original 1977 version of the film and also, at the behest of Columbia, and as a condition of Spielberg revising the film, shot additional footage showing the audience the interior of the mothership seen at the end of the film (a decision Spielberg would later regret as he felt the interior of the mothership should have remained a mystery)</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, the re-release was a moderate success, while the 2001 DVD release of the film restored the original ending</span>
				<span class='text'>==1980s===Next, Spielberg teamed with ''[[Star Wars]]'' creator and friend [[George Lucas]] on an action adventure film, ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', the first of the [[Indiana Jones]] films</span>
				<span class='text'>The archaeologist and adventurer hero Indiana Jones was played by [[Harrison Ford]] (whom Lucas had previously cast in his ''[[Star Wars]]'' films as [[Han Solo]])</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was considered an homage to the cliffhanger serials of the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It became the biggest film at the box office in 1981, and the recipient of numerous Oscar nominations including Best Director (Spielberg's second nomination) and Best Picture (the second Spielberg film to be nominated for Best Picture)</span>
				<span class='text'>''Raiders'' is still considered a landmark example of the action-adventure genre</span>
				<span class='text'>The film also led to Ford's casting in [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Blade Runner]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>Most of his films deal with ordinary characters searching for or coming in contact with extraordinary beings or finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;!-- This is especially evident in the [[Indiana Jones]] series</span>
				<span class='text'>: Archaeologist, adventurer and relic hunter is not really an &quot;ordinary character&quot;--&gt;In an [[American Film Institute|AFI]] interview in August 2000 Spielberg commented on his interest in the possibility of extra terrestrial life and how it has influenced some of his films</span>
				<span class='text'>Spielberg described himself as feeling like an alien during childhood,&lt;ref name=&quot;McBride&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = McBride| first = Joseph| title = Steven Spielberg| publisher = Faber and Faber|year=1997| isbn = 0-571-19177-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his interest came from his father, a science fiction fan, and his opinion that aliens would not travel light years for conquest, but instead curiosity and sharing of knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = E</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>DVD Production Notes Booklet| publisher = Universal|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;A strong consistent [[theme (literature)|theme]] in his family-friendly work is a childlike, even naïve, sense of wonder and faith, as attested by works such as ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', ''[[E</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', and ''[[A</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Artificial Intelligence]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Warren Buckland,&lt;ref&gt;Directed by Steven Spielberg: Poetics of the Contemporary Hollywood Blockbuster&lt;/ref&gt; these themes are portrayed through the use of low height camera tracking shots, which have become one of Spielberg's directing trademarks</span>
				<span class='text'>In the cases when his films include children (''E</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the Extra-Terrestrial'', ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', etc</span>
				<span class='text'>, this type of shot is more apparent, but it is also used in films like ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'', ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', ''[[The Terminal]]'', ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', and ''[[Amistad (1997 film)|Amistad]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>If one views each of his films, one will see this shot utilized by the director, notably the water scenes in ''Jaws'' are filmed from the low-angle perspective of someone swimming</span>
				<span class='text'>Another child oriented theme in Spielberg's films is that of loss of innocence and coming-of-age</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Empire of the Sun'', Jim, a well-groomed and spoiled English youth, loses his innocence as he suffers through World War II China</span>
				<span class='text'>Similarly, in ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', Frank naively and foolishly believes that he can reclaim his shattered family if he accumulates enough money to support them</span>
				<span class='text'>he most persistent theme throughout his films is tension in parent-child relationships</span>
				<span class='text'>Parents (often fathers) are reluctant, absent or ignorant</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter Banning in ''Hook'' starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married-to-his-work parent who through the course of the film regains the respect of his children</span>
				<span class='text'>The notable absence of Elliott's father in ''E</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>', is the most famous example of this theme</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son &quot;self reliance,&quot; which is not how Indy saw it)</span>
				<span class='text'>Even [[Oskar Schindler]], from ''[[Schindler's List]]'', is reluctant to have a child with his wife</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Munich]]'' depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter</span>
				<span class='text'>There are of course exceptions; Brody in ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' is a committed family man, while John Anderton in ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son</span>
				<span class='text'>This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, to this theme, protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents, most notably ''E</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the Extra-Terrestrial'' (protagonist Elliot's mother is divorced) and ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' (Frank Abagnale's mother and father split early on in the film)</span>
				<span class='text'>Little known also is Tim in ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (early in the film, another secondary character mentions Tim and Lex's parents' divorce)</span>
				<span class='text'>The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures, Tim looks to Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Alan Grant as a father figure</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially, Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to Tim</span>
				<span class='text'>However, by the end of the film, he has changed, and the kids even fall asleep with their heads on his shoulders</span>
				<span class='text'>ost of his films are generally optimistic in nature</span>
				<span class='text'>Critics frequently accuse his films of being overly sentimental, though Spielberg feels it is fine as long as it is disguised</span>
				<span class='text'>The influence comes from directors [[Frank Capra]] and [[John Ford]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;culture show&quot;&gt;{{cite video| title = The Culture Show| medium = TV|publisher=BBC|date = November 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;==Frequent collaborators=====Actors===In terms of casting and production itself, Spielberg has a known penchant for working with actors and production members from his previous films</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance, he has cast [[Richard Dreyfuss]] in several films: ''Jaws'', ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'', and ''Always''</span>
				<span class='text'>Aside from his role as Indiana Jones, Spielberg also cast [[Harrison Ford]] as a headteacher in ''E</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the Extra-Terrestrial'' (though the scene was ultimately cut)</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Spielberg directed veteran voice actor [[Frank Welker]] only once (in ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', for which he voiced many of the animals), Welker has lent his voice in a number of productions Spielberg has executive produced from ''[[Gremlins]]'' to its sequel ''[[Gremlins 2: The New Batch]]'', as well as ''[[The Land Before Time]]'', ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', and television shows such as ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures|Tiny Toons]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', and ''SeaQuest DSV''</span>
				<span class='text'>Spielberg has used Tom Hanks on several occasions and has cast him in ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', ''[[The Terminal]]'', and ''[[Bridge of Spies (film)|Bridge of Spies]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Spielberg has collaborated with Tom Cruise twice on ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' and ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'', and cast Shia LaBeouf in five films: ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'', ''[[Eagle Eye]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]'', and ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>==Other collaborations===Spielberg prefers working with production members with whom he has developed an existing working relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>An example of this is his production relationship with [[Kathleen Kennedy (film producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] who has served as producer on all his major films from ''[[E</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' to the recent ''[[Lincoln (2012 film)|Lincoln]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>For cinematography, [[Allen Daviau]], a childhood friend and cinematographer, shot the early Spielberg film ''Amblin'' and most of his films up to ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]''; [[Janusz Kamiński]] who has shot every Spielberg film since ''Schindler's List'' (see [[List of film director and cinematographer collaborations]]); and the film editor [[Michael Kahn (film editor)|Michael Kahn]] who has edited every film directed by Spielberg from ''Close Encounters'' to ''Munich'' (except ''E</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the Extra-Terrestrial'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of the DVDs of Spielberg's films have documentaries by [[Laurent Bouzereau]]</span>
				<span class='text'> famous example of Spielberg working with the same professionals is his long-time collaboration with [[John Williams]] and the use of his musical scores in all of his films since ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'' (except ''[[Bridge of Spies (film)|Bridge of Spies]]'', ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'' and ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>One of Spielberg's trademarks is his use of music by John Williams to add to the visual impact of his scenes and to try and create a lasting picture and sound of the film in the memories of the film audience</span>
				<span class='text'>These visual scenes often uses images of the sun (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>''Empire of the Sun'', ''Saving Private Ryan'', the final scene of ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', and the end credits of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (where they ride into the sunset)), of which the last two feature a Williams score at that end scene</span>
				<span class='text'>Spielberg is a contemporary of filmmakers [[George Lucas]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Martin Scorsese]], [[John Milius]], and [[Brian De Palma]], collectively known as the &quot;[[Movie Brats]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Aside from his principal role as a director, Spielberg has acted as a producer for a considerable number of films, including early hits for [[Joe Dante]] and [[Robert Zemeckis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Spielberg has often never worked with the same screenwriter in his films, beside [[Tony Kushner]] and [[David Koepp]], who have written a few of his films more than once</span>
				<span class='text'>=Personal life=====Marriages and children===Spielberg first met actress [[Amy Irving]] in 1976 at the suggestion of director [[Brian De Palma]], who knew he was looking for an actress to play in ''Close Encounters''</span>
				<span class='text'>After meeting her, Spielberg told his co-producer [[Julia Phillips]], &quot;I met a real heartbreaker last night</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=McBride/&gt;{{rp|293}} Although she was too young for the role, she and Spielberg began dating and she eventually moved in to what she described as his &quot;bachelor funky&quot; house</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=McBride/&gt;{{rp|294}} They lived together for four years, but the stresses of their professional careers took a toll on their relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>Irving wanted to be certain that whatever success she attained as an actress would be her own: &quot;I don't want to be known as Steven's girlfriend,&quot; she said, and chose not to be in any of his films during those years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=McBride/&gt;{{rp|295}}As a result, they broke up in 1979, but remained close friends</span>
				<span class='text'>Then in 1984 they renewed their romance, and in November 1985, they married, already having had a son, Max Samuel</span>
				<span class='text'>After three and a half years of marriage, however, many of the same competing stresses of their careers caused them to divorce in 1989</span>
				<span class='text'>They agreed to maintain homes near each other as to facilitate the shared custody and parenting of their son</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=McBride/&gt;{{rp|403}} Their divorce was recorded as the third most costly celebrity divorce in history</span>
