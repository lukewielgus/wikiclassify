				<span class='text'>quot; Yates then told Brooks that, &quot;Country singers always seem to be weeping over the dead dog and things,&quot; and also remarked, &quot;I thought you'd come in here and twiddle your pistol around and be impressed</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Although Brooks remained polite, he did observe that Yates was obviously unfamiliar with modern country music</span>
				<span class='text'>Scores of Brooks fans later wrote to complain about his treatment on the show</span>

				<span class='text'>Unlike [[Alan Jackson]], who refused to return to the UK after being treated in a similar manner by the press, Brooks returned in 1996 for more sold-out concerts, although this time his media appearances were mostly restricted to country radio and interviews with [[magazine]]s</span>
