				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;{{TOC limit|2}}==Early life and education===== Gold Coast ===Kwame Nkrumah was born in about 1909 in [[Nkroful]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although his mother, whose name was Nyanibah, later stated his year of birth was 1912, Nkrumah wrote that he was born on 18 September 1909, a Saturday, and by [[Akan names|the naming customs]] of the [[Akan people]] was given the name Kwame, that being the name given to males born on a Saturday</span>
				<span class='text'>During his years as a student in the United States, though, he was known as Francis Nwia Kofi Nkrumah, with Kofi being the name given to males born on Friday</span>
				<span class='text'>The name of his father is not known; most accounts say he was a goldsmith</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Ebenezer Obiri Addo in his study of the future president, the name &quot;Nkrumah&quot;, a name traditionally given to a ninth child, indicates that Kwame likely held that place in the house of his father, who had several wives</span>
				<span class='text'>Kwame, though, was the only child of his mother</span>
				<span class='text'>{efn|Nyanibah survived her son, watching over him throughout his life</span>
				<span class='text'>For a time after his death, she guarded his tomb</span>
				<span class='text'>See {{harvnb|Birmingham|p=3}}</span>
				<span class='text'>}{{sfn|Addo|pp=50‚Äì51}}Nkroful was a small village,  in the far southwest of the Gold Coast, close to the frontier with the French colony of the [[Ivory Coast]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His father did not live with the family, but worked in [[Half Assini]] before his death while Kwame was a boy</span>
				<span class='text'>Kwame Nkrumah was raised by his mother and his extended family, who lived together in traditional fashion, with more distant relatives often visiting</span>
				<span class='text'>He lived a carefree childhood, spent in the village, in the bush, and on the nearby sea</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rooney|p=7}}Nkrumah's mother sent him to the elementary school run by a Catholic [[mission (Christianity)|mission]] at Half Assini, where he proved an adept student</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rooney|pp=7‚Äì8}} He progressed through the ten-year elementary programme in only eight</span>
				<span class='text'>By about 1925 he was a student-teacher in the school, and had been baptised into the faith</span>
				<span class='text'>While at the school, he was noticed by the Reverend [[Alec Garden Fraser]], principal of the Government Training College (soon to become [[Achimota School]]) in the Gold Coast's capital, [[Accra]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Fraser arranged for Nkumrah to train as a teacher at his school</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rooney|pp=7‚Äì8}}{{sfn|Owusu-Ansah|p=239}} Here, Columbia-educated deputy headmaster [[James Emman Kwegyir Aggrey|Kwegyir Aggrey]] exposed him to the ideas of [[Marcus Garvey]] and [[W</span>

				<span class='text'>Du Bois]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Aggrey, Fraser, and others at Achimota taught that there should be close co-operation between the races in governing the Gold Coast, but Nkrumah, echoing Garvey, soon came to believe that only when the black race governed itself could there be harmony between the races</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rooney|p=9}}{{sfn|Addo|pp=53‚Äì54}}After graduating from Achimota in 1930, Nkrumah was given a teaching post at the Catholic primary school in [[Elmina, Ghana|Elmina]], and after a year there, was made headmaster of the school at [[Axim]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Axim, he started to get involved in politics and founded the Nzima Literary Society</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1933, he was appointed a teacher at the Catholic seminary at [[Amisso, Ghana|Amissa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the life there was strict, he liked it, and considered becoming a [[Jesuit]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, he decided to further his education</span>
				<span class='text'>Nkrumah had heard journalist  and future Nigerian president [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]] speak while a student at Achimota; the two men met and Azikiwe's influence increased Nkrumah's interest in black nationalism</span>
				<span class='text'>The young teacher decided to further his education</span>
				<span class='text'>Azikiwe had attended [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln College]], a [[historically black colleges and universities|historically black college]] in [[Chester County, Pennsylvania]], west of Philadelphia, and he advised Nkrumah to enroll there</span>
				<span class='text'>Nkrumah, who had failed the entrance examination for [[London University]] gained funds for the trip and his education from relatives</span>
				<span class='text'>He travelled by way of Britain, where he learned, to his outrage, of Italy's invasion of [[Ethiopia]], one of the few independent African nations</span>
				<span class='text'>He arrived in the United States, in October 1935</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rooney|pp=9‚Äì12}}=== United States  ===According to historian [[John Henrik Clarke]] in his article on Nkrumah's American sojourn, &quot;the influence of the ten years that he spent in the United States would have a lingering effect on the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Clarke|9‚Äì10}}  Nkrumah had sought entry to Lincoln some time before he began his studies there; on 1 March 1935, he had sent the school a letter noting that his application had been pending for more than a year</span>
				<span class='text'>When he arrived in New York in October 1935, he travelled to Pennsylvania, where he enrolled despite lacking the funds for the full [[semester]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Clarke|p=10}} However, he soon won a scholarship that provided for his tuition at Lincoln</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, he remained short on money through his time in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rooney|p=12}} To make ends meet, he worked in menial jobs, including as a dishwasher</span>
				<span class='text'>On Sundays, he visited black Presbyterian churches in Philadelphia and in New York</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Birmingham|p=4}}As a student in the United States, Nkrumah proved successful, gaining a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in economics and sociology in 1939</span>
				<span class='text'>Lincoln then appointed him an assistant lecturer in philosophy, and he began to receive invitations to be a guest preacher in Presbyterian churches in both Philadelphia and New York</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1939, Nkrumah enrolled both at Lincoln's seminary and at the [[Ivy League]] [[University of Pennsylvania]] in Philadelphia</span>
				<span class='text'>He gained a [[Bachelor of Theology]] degree from Lincoln in 1942, the top student in the course, and earned from Penn the following year both a [[Master of Arts]] degree in philosophy and a [[Master of Science]] in education</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rooney|pp=13‚Äì14}}Nkrumah spent his summers in [[Harlem]], a center of black life and thought</span>
				<span class='text'>He found housing and employment in New York City with difficulty and involved himself in the community</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent many evenings listening to and arguing with street orators, and according to Clarke,{{quote |These evenings were a vital part of Kwame Nkrumah's American education</span>
				<span class='text'>He was going to a university‚Äîthe university of the Harlem Streets</span>
				<span class='text'>This was no ordinary time and these street speakers were no ordinary men&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he streets of Harlem were open forums, presided over [by]&lt;!-- typo in original, &quot;my&quot; --&gt; master speakers like Arthur Reed and his protege Ira Kemp</span>
				<span class='text'>The young Carlos Cook, founder of the Garvey oriented African Pioneer Movement was on the scene, also bringing a nightly message to his street followers</span>
				<span class='text'>Occasionally Suji Abdul Hamid, a champion of Harlem labor, held a night rally and demanded more jobs for blacks in their own community&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>This is part of the drama on the Harlem streets as the student, Kwame Nkrumah walked and watched</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Clarke|p=11}}}}Nkrumah was an activist student, organizing a group of expatriate African students in Pennsylvania and building it into the African Students Association of America and Canada, becoming its president</span>
				<span class='text'>Some members felt that the group should aspire for each colony to gain independence on its own; Nkrumah urged a [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-African]] strategy</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rooney|pp=14‚Äì15}} Nkrumah played a major role in the Pan-African conference held in New York in 1944, which urged the United States, at the end of the [[Second World War]], to help ensure Africa became developed and free</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rooney|p=16}}His old teacher, Aggrey, had died in 1929 in the United States, and in 1942, Nkrumah led traditional prayers for Aggrey at the gravesite</span>
				<span class='text'>This led to a break between him and Lincoln, though after he rose to prominence in the Gold Coast, he returned in 1951 to accept an honorary degree</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Addo|pp=62‚Äì65}}{{sfn|Owusu-Ansah|p=32}} Nevertheless, Nkrumah's doctoral thesis remained uncompleted</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sherwood|pp=106‚Äì107}} Nkrumah was determined to go to London, wanting to continue his education there now that the [[Second World War]] had ended</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Addo|p=70}} James, in a 1945 letter introducing Nkrumah to Trinidad-born [[George Padmore]] in London, wrote: &quot;this young man is coming to you</span>

				<span class='text'>Äù{{sfn|Sherwood|p=114}}=== London ===Nkrumah returned to London in May 1945 and enrolled at the [[London School of Economics]] as a PhD candidate in anthropology</span>
				<span class='text'>He withdrew after one term and the next year enrolled at University College, with the intent to write a philosophy dissertation on &quot;Knowledge and Logical Positivism&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>His supervisor, [[A</span>

				<span class='text'>He wanted answers too quickly</span>
				<span class='text'>I think part of the trouble may have been that he wasn't concentrating very hard on his thesis</span>

				<span class='text'>He and Padmore were among the principal organizers of the Fifth [[Pan-African Congress]] in Manchester</span>

				<span class='text'>They agreed to pursue a federal United States of Africa, with interlocking regional organizations, governing through separate states of limited sovereignty</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rooney|p=23}}The congress sought to establish ongoing African activism in Britain in conjunction with the [[West African National Secretariat]] (WANS) to work towards the [[decolonization of Africa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Nkrumah became the secretary of WANS</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to seeking to organise Africans to gain their nations' freedom, Nkrumah sought to succor the many West African seamen who had been stranded, destitute, in London at the end of the war, and established a Coloured Workers Association to empower and succor them</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Sherwood|pp=173‚Äì178}} Nkrumah and Padmore established a group called The Circle to lead the way to West African independence and unity; the group aimed to create a Union of African Socialist Republic</span>
				<span class='text'>A document from The Circle, setting forth that goal, was found on Nkrumah upon his arrest in Accra in 1948, and was used against him by the British authorities</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rooney|p=25}}==Return to the Gold Coast===== United Gold Coast Convention ===The 1946 Gold Coast constitution gave Africans a majority on the Legislative Council for the first time</span>
				<span class='text'>Seen as a major step towards self-government,{{sfn|Rooney|pp=26‚Äì27}} the new arrangement prompted the colony's first true political party, founded in August 1947, the [[United Gold Coast Convention]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The UGCC sought self-government as quickly as possible</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the leading members were all successful professionals, they needed to pay someone to run the party, and their choice fell on Nkrumah at the suggestion of Ako Adjei</span>
				<span class='text'>Nkrumah hesitated, realising the UGCC was controlled by conservative interests, but decided that the new post gave him huge political opportunities, and accepted</span>
				<span class='text'>After being questioned by British officials about his Communist affiliations, Nkrumah boarded the MV ''Accra'' at Liverpool in November 1947 for the voyage home</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rooney|pp=36‚Äì37}}Despite the fact that the Gold Coast was politically more advanced than Britain's other West Africa colonies, there was considerable discontent</span>
				<span class='text'>Postwar inflation had caused public anger at high prices, leading to a boycott of the small stores run by Arabs which began in January 1948</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[cocoa bean]] farmers were upset because trees exhibiting [[cacao swollen-shoot virus|swollen-shoot disease]], but still capable of yielding a crop, were being destroyed by the colonial authorities</span>

				<span class='text'>Both Nkrumah and Danquah addressed a meeting of the Ex-Servicemen's Union in Accra on 20 February 1948, which was in preparation for a march to present a petition to the governor</span>

				<span class='text'>They were freed in April 1948</span>
				<span class='text'>Many students and teachers had demonstrated for their release, and been suspended; Nkrumah, using his own funds, began the [[Ghana National College]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This, among other activities, led UGCC committee members to accuse him of acting in the party's name without authority</span>
				<span class='text'>Fearing he would harm them more outside the party than within, they agreed to make him honorary treasurer</span>
				<span class='text'>Nkrumah's popularity, already large, was increased with his founding of the ''[[Accra Evening News]]'', which was not a party organ but was owned by Nkrumah and others</span>
				<span class='text'>He also founded the Committee on Youth Organization (CYO), originally intended as a youth wing for the UGCC, but which soon broke from it under the motto &quot;Self-Government Now&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|249px|Red cockerel, ‚ÄùForward Ever, Backward Never‚Äù: Convention People's Party logo and slogan]]Beginning in April 1949, there was considerable pressure on Nkrumah from his supporters to leave the UGCC and form his own party</span>
				<span class='text'>On 12 June 1949, he announced the formation of the [[Convention People's Party]] (CPP), with the word &quot;convention&quot; chosen, according to Nkrumah, &quot;to carry the masses with us&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Addo|p=88}} There were attempts to heal the breach with the UGCC; at one July meeting, it was agreed to reinstate Nkrumah as secretary and disband the CPP</span>
				<span class='text'>But Nkrumah's supporters would not have it, and persuaded him to refuse the offer and remain at their head</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Addo|pp=88‚Äì89}}The CPP appropriated the red [[cockerel]] as its symbol‚Äîa familiar icon for local ethnic groups, and a symbol of leadership, alertness, and masculinity</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Hagan2 /&gt; CPP operatives drove red-white-and-green vans across the country, playing music and rallying public support for the party and especially for Nkrumah</span>
				<span class='text'>These efforts were wildly successful, especially because previous political efforts in the Gold Coast had focused exclusively on the urban intelligentsia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Hagan2 /&gt;The British convened a select commission of [[middle-class]] Africans, including all of the Big Six except Nkrumah, to draft a new constitution that would give Ghana more self-government</span>
				<span class='text'>Nkrumah saw, even before the commission reported, that its recommendations would fall short of full [[dominion]] status, and began to organise a [[Positive Action]] campaign</span>
				<span class='text'>Nkrumah demanded a [[constituent assembly]] to write a constitution</span>
				<span class='text'>When the governor, [[Charles Arden-Clarke]], would not commit to this, Nkrumah called for Positive Action, with the unions beginning a [[general strike]] to begin on 8 January 1950</span>
				<span class='text'>The strike quickly led to violence, and Nkrumah and other CPP leaders were arrested on 22 January, with the ''Evening News'' banned</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Fisher|pp=169‚Äì174}} Nkrumah was sentenced to a total of three years in prison, and he was incarcerated with common criminals in Accra's [[Fort James (Ghana)|Fort James]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rooney|pp=55‚Äì56}}Nkrumah's assistant, [[Komla Agbeli Gbedemah]], ran the CPP in his absence; the imprisoned leader was able to influence events through smuggled notes written on toilet paper</span>
				<span class='text'>The British prepared for an election for the Gold Coast under their new constitution, and Nkrumah insisted that the CPP contest all seats</span>
				<span class='text'>The situation had become calmer once Nkrumah was arrested, and the CPP and the British worked together to prepare electoral rolls</span>
				<span class='text'>Nkrumah stood, from prison, for a directly-elected Accra seat</span>
				<span class='text'>Gbedemah worked to set up a nationwide campaign organisation, using vans with loudspeakers to blare the party's message</span>
				<span class='text'>The UGCC failed to set up a nationwide structure, and proved unable to take advantage of the fact that many of its opponents were in prison</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rooney|pp=56‚Äì57}}In the [[Gold Coast legislative election, 1951|February 1951 legislative election]], the first general election to be held under universal franchise in colonial Africa,the CPP was elected in a landslide</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bourret|pp=175‚Äì177}} The following day, Arden-Clarke sent for him and asked him to form a government</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rooney|p=61}}=== Leader of Government Business and Prime Minister ===Nkrumah faced multiple challenges as he assumed office</span>
				<span class='text'>He had never served in government, and needed to learn that art</span>
				<span class='text'> The Gold Coast was composed of four regions, multiple former colonies amalgamated into one, and Nkrumah sought to unite them under one nationality, and bring the country to independence</span>
				<span class='text'>Key to meeting the challenges was convincing the British that the CPP's programmes were not only practical, but inevitable, and Nkrumah and Arden-Clarke worked closely together</span>
				<span class='text'>The governor instructed the civil service to give the fledgling government full support, and the three British members of the cabinet took care not to vote against the elected majority</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Birmingham|pp=37‚Äì38}}Prior to the CPP taking office, British officials had prepared a ten-year plan for development</span>
				<span class='text'>With demands for infrastructure improvements coming in from all over the colony, Nkrumah approved it in general, but halved the time to five years</span>
				<span class='text'>The colony was in good financial shape, with reserves from years of cocoa profit held in London, and Nkrumah was able to spend freely</span>
				<span class='text'>Modern trunk roads were built along the coast and within the interior</span>
				<span class='text'>The rail system was modernised and expanded</span>
				<span class='text'>Modern water and sewer systems were installed in most towns, where housing schemes were begun</span>
				<span class='text'>A new harbour at [[Tema]], near Accra, began to be constructed, and the existing port, at [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Takoradi]], was expanded</span>
				<span class='text'>An urgent programme to build and expand schools, from primary to teacher and trade training, was begun</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1951 to 1956, the number of pupils being educated at the colony's schools rose from 200,000 to 500,000</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rooney|pp=82‚Äì83}} Nevertheless, the number of graduates being produced was insufficient to the burgeoning civil service's needs, and in 1953, Nkrumah announced that though Africans would be given preference, the country would be relying on expatriate European civil servants for several years</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bourret|p=178}}Nkrumah's initial title was Leader of Government Business in a cabinet chaired by Arden-Clarke</span>
				<span class='text'>Quick progress was made, and in 1952, the governor withdrew from the cabinet, leaving Nkrumah as his prime minister, with the portfolios that had been reserved for expatriates going to Africans</span>
				<span class='text'>here were accusations of corruption, and of nepotism, as officials, following African custom, attempted to benefit their extended families and their tribes</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Birmingham|pp=40‚Äì43}} The recommendations following the 1948 riots had included elected local government rather than the existing system dominated by the chiefs</span>
				<span class='text'>This was uncontroversial until it became clear that it would be implemented by the CPP</span>
				<span class='text'>That party's majority in the  [[Legislative Assembly of the Gold Coast|Legislative Assembly]] passed legislation in late 1951 that shifted power from the chiefs to the chairs of the councils, though there was some local rioting as [[rates (tax)|rates]] were imposed</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Rooney|pp=181‚Äì182}}Nkruman's retitling as prime minister had not given him additional power, and he sought constitutional reform that would lead to independence</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1952, he consulted with the visiting [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]], [[Oliver Lyttelton]], who indicated that Britain would look favourably on further advancement, so long as the chiefs and other stakeholders had the opportunity to express their views</span>
				<span class='text'>Accordingly, beginning in October 1952, Nkrumah sought opinions from councils and from political parties on reform, and consulted widely across the country, including with opposition groups</span>
				<span class='text'>The result the following year was a [[White Paper]] on a new constitution, seen as a final step before independence</span>
				<span class='text'>Published in June 1953, the constitutional proposals were accepted both by the assembly and by the British, and came into force in April of the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>The new document provided for an assembly of 104 members, all directly elected, with an all-African cabinet responsible for the internal governing of the colony</span>
				<span class='text'>In [[Gold Coast legislative election, 1954|the election]] on 15 June 1954, the CPP won 71, with the regional [[Northern People's Party]] forming the official opposition</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bourret|pp=183‚Äì186}}A number of opposition groups formed the [[National Liberation Movement (Ghana)|National Liberation Movement]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Their demands were for a federal, rather than a unitary government for an independent Gold Coast, and for an upper house of parliament where chiefs and other traditional leaders could act as a counter to the CPP majority in the assembly</span>
				<span class='text'>They drew considerable support in the Northern Territory and among the chiefs in Ashanti, who petitioned the British queen, [[Elizabeth II]], asking for a [[Royal Commission]] into what form of government the Gold Coast should have</span>
				<span class='text'>This was refused by her government, who in 1955 stated that such a commission should only be used if the people of the Gold Coast proved incapable of deciding their own affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>Amid political violence, the two sides attempted to reconcile their differences, but the NLM refused to participate in any committee with a CPP majority</span>
				<span class='text'>The traditional leaders were also incensed by a new bill that had just been enacted, which allowed minor chiefs to appeal to the government in Accra, bypassing traditional chiefly authority</span>
				<span class='text'>The British were unwilling to leave unresolved the fundamental question as to how an independent Gold Coast should be governed, and in June 1956, the Colonial Secretary, [[Alan Lennox-Boyd]] announced that there would be another general election in the Gold Coast, and if a &quot;reasonable majority&quot; took the CPP's position, Britain would set a date for independence</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bourret|pp=187‚Äì191}} The [[Gold Coast legislative election, 1956|July 1956 election]] saw results almost identical to that four years previously, and on 3 August the assembly voted for independence under the name Nkrumah had proposed in April, [[Ghana]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In September, the Colonial Office announced independence day would be 6 March 1957</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Birmingham|p=58}}{{sfn|Owusu-Ansah|p=lii}}The opposition was not satisfied with the plan for independence, and demanded that power be devolved to the regions</span>
				<span class='text'>Discussions took place through late 1956 and into 1957</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Nkrumah did not compromise on his insistence on a unitary state, the nation was divided into five regions, with power devolved from Accra, and the chiefs having a role in their governments</span>
				<span class='text'>On 21 February 1957, the [[British prime minister]], [[Harold Macmillan]], announced that Ghana would be a full member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] with effect from 6 March</span>

				<span class='text'>There was trouble in [[Volta Region|Togoland]] that required the moving of troops there</span>
				<span class='text'>A serious bus strike in Accra stemmed from resentments among the [[Ga people|Ga]] people, who believed members of other tribes were getting preferred treatment in government promotion, and this led to riots there in August</span>
				<span class='text'>Nkrumah's response was to repress local movements by the Avoidance of Discrimination Act (6 December 1957), which banned regional or tribally-based political parties</span>
				<span class='text'>Another strike at tribalism fell in Ashanti, where Nkrumah and the CPP got most local chiefs who were not party supporters [[Golden Stool|destooled]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Nkrumah was convinced there had been an assassination plot against him, and his response was to have the parliament pass the [[Preventive Detention]] Act, allowing for incarceration for up to five years without charge or trial, with only Nkrumah empowered to release prisoners early</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Nkrumah's biographer, David Birmingham, &quot;no single measure did more to bring down Nkrumah's reputation than his adoption of internment without trial for the preservation of security</span>

				<span class='text'>These chiefs had maintained authority during colonial rule through collaboration with the British authorities; in fact, they were sometimes favored over the local intelligentsia, who made trouble for the British with organizations like the [[Aborigines' Rights Protection Society]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Convention People's Party had a strained relationship with the chiefs when it came to power, and this relationship became more hostile as the CPP incited political opposition chiefs and criticized the institution as undemocratic</span>

				<span class='text'>The implications of this for socio-political practice have to be worked out scientifically, and the necessary social and economic policies pursued with resolution</span>

				<span class='text'>In ''African Socialism Revisited'' Nkrumah therefore rejects the idea of an &quot;[[Ujamaa|African socialism]]&quot; in the sense [[Julius Nyerere|Nyerere]], one of the &quot;''ideology of continuity''&quot; ([[Paulin J</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;''Nkrumah will never have imagined back Africa as a special world, but he accepted that our societies to the same laws are subject like any other country in the world, and that the African revolution, if properly understood, is inextricably linked to the world revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>'&quot;In &quot;Africa Must Unite&quot; (1963) Nkrumah called for the immediate formation of a pan-African government</span>
				<span class='text'>Later he demanded a unification movement that emanates from the base, arguing that between anti-imperialist governments and Western-backed &quot;puppet regimes&quot; there could be no common ground</span>
				<span class='text'>-&gt;Nkrumah was also best-known politically for his strong commitment to and promotion of [[Pan-Africanism]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Nkrumah looked to these men in order to craft a general solution to the ills of Africa</span>
				<span class='text'>To follow in these intellectual footsteps Nkrumah had intended to continue his education in London, but ultimately found himself involved in direct activism</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, motivated by advice from Du Bois, Nkrumah decided to focus on creating peace in Africa</span>
				<span class='text'>Nkrumah's dedications to pan-africanism in action attracted these intellectuals to his Ghanaian projects</span>
