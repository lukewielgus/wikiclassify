				<span class='text'>Apparently she was underwhelmed</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer had a notably strained relationship with his mother Johanna Schopenhauer</span>
				<span class='text'>After his fathers death Arthur Schopenhauer endured two long years of drudgery as a merchant in honor of his dead father</span>
				<span class='text'>Then his mother retired to Weimar and Arthur Schopenhauer dedicated himself wholly to studies in the gymnasium of </span>
				<span class='text'>He left it in disgust after seeing one of the masters lampooned and went to live with his mother</span>
				<span class='text'>But by that time she had already opened her famous salon and Arthur was not compatible with what he considered to be the vain ceremonious ways of the salon</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also disgusted by the ease with which Johanna Schopenhauer had forgotten his fathers memory</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently he attempted university life</span>
				<span class='text'>There he wrote his first book </span>
				<span class='text'>His mother informed him that the book was incomprehensible and it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy</span>
				<span class='text'>In a fit of temper Arthur Schopenhauer told her that his work would be read long after the rubbish she wrote would have been totally forgotten</span>

				<span class='text'>Allen amp Unwin ltd  Thought A key focus of Schopenhauer was his investigation of individual motivation</span>
				<span class='text'>Before Schopenhauer Hegel had popularized the concept of  the idea that society consisted of a  which moved in a distinct direction dictating the actions of its members</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer a reader of both Kant and Hegel criticized their logical optimism and the belief that individual morality could be determined by society and reason</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer believed that humans were motivated by only their own basic desires or  Will to Live which directed all of mankind</span>
				<span class='text'>he reality is what Schopenhauer calls the Will the Will to Live</span>
				<span class='text'>Letter to Richard C</span>
				<span class='text'>Lyon 1 August 1949  The Letters of George Santayana Scribners New York 1955 For Schopenhauer human desire was futile illogical directionless and by extension so was all human action in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote Man can indeed do what he wants but he cannot will what he wants</span>
				<span class='text'>In this sense he adhered to the Fichtean principle of idealism the world is for a subject</span>
				<span class='text'>This idealism so presented immediately commits it to an ethical attitude unlike the purely epistemological concerns of  and </span>
				<span class='text'>To Schopenhauer the Will is a malignant name inveigles  metaphysical existence which controls not only the actions of individual intelligent agents but ultimately all observable phenomena an evil to be terminated via mankinds duties  and chastity</span>
				<span class='text'>name inveigles  He is credited with one of the most famous opening lines of philosophy The world is my representation</span>
				<span class='text'>Will for Schopenhauer is what Kant called the </span>
				<span class='text'>ut like Fichte he rejects the Kantian claim that the thing in itself as an unknowable substratum of experience</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauers argument is that the thing in itself in Kant is an incoherent sense of object it is the opposite to objects and yet it is said to be an object in itself the phantom of a dream</span>
				<span class='text'>  was greatly influenced by this idea of Will while developing it in a different direction</span>
				<span class='text'>or Schopenhauer human desiring willing and craving cause </span>
				<span class='text'>A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation a method comparable to s Sublimation</span>
				<span class='text'>Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this pain‚Äîalbeit temporarily‚Äîbecause it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception theore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds time space and causality from which one is separated rather one becomes one with that perception one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception The World as Will and Representation section 34</span>
				<span class='text'>From this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to ones individual will but rather becomes a subject of cognition to a perception that is Pure will less timeless section 34 where the essence ideas of the world are shown</span>
				<span class='text'>Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict ones immersion with the world thus tries to depict the essence pure ideas of the world</span>
				<span class='text'>Music for Schopenhauer was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds theore as an individual object</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Daniel Albright Schopenhauer thought that  was the only art that did not merely copy ideas but actually embodied the will itself</span>
				<span class='text'>aniel Albright Modernism and Music 2004 page 39 footnote 34 He deemed music to be a timeless universal language which is comprehended everywhere and can imbue global enthusiasm if in possession of a significant melody</span>

				<span class='text'>Writing shortly before the logical independence of the axiom was demonstrated by the discovery of  and long before the  revealed that it does not express a property of physical space Schopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to prove from indirect s that which he held to be directly evident from </span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout his writingsI wanted in this way to stress and demonstrate the great difference indeed opposition between knowledge of perception and abstract or lected knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>Hitherto this difference has received too little attention and its establishment is a fundamental feature of my philosophy‚Ä¶ Ibid</span>

				<span class='text'> Schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts instead of from intuitive perceptions</span>

				<span class='text'>According to Schopenhauer compassion alone is the good of the object of the acts that is they cannot be inspired by either the prospect of personal utility or the feeling of duty</span>
				<span class='text'>Mankind can also be guided by  and </span>
				<span class='text'>Egotistic acts are those guided by self interest desire for pleasure or happiness</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer believed most of our deeds belong to this class</span>
				<span class='text'>Acts of malice are different from egotistic acts</span>
				<span class='text'>As in the case of acts of compassion these do not target personal utility</span>
				<span class='text'>Their aim is to cause damage to others independently of personal gains</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed like  in the unity of all with one self and also believed that ego is the origin of pain and conflicts that reduction of ego frames the moral principles</span>
				<span class='text'> According to Schopenhauer whenever we make a choice we assume as necessary that decision was preceded by something from which it ensued and which we call the ground or reason or more accurately the motive of the resultant action</span>
				<span class='text'>name Schopenhauer1974  Choices are not made freely</span>
				<span class='text'>Our actions are necessary and determined because every human being even every animal after the motive has appeared must carry out the action which alone is in accordance with his inborn and immutable character</span>

				<span class='text'>It does so by placing beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone in the inescapable punishment</span>

				<span class='text'>All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north and there gradually became white had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need want and misery which in their many forms were brought about by the climate</span>

				<span class='text'>the actually existing entity with what he termed will deserves some explanation</span>
				<span class='text'>The noumenon was what Kant called the Ding an sich the Thing in Itself the reality that is the foundation of our  and  representations of an external world</span>
				<span class='text'>In Kantian terms those sensory and mental representations are mere phenomena</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer departed from Kant in his description of the relationship between the phenomenon and the noumenon</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Kant things in themselves ground the phenomenal representations in our minds Schopenhauer on the other hand believed phenomena and noumena to be two different sides of the same coin</span>
				<span class='text'>Noumena do not cause phenomena but rather phenomena are simply the way by which our minds perceive the noumena according to the </span>
				<span class='text'>This is explained more fully in Schopenhauers doctoral thesis </span>
				<span class='text'>chopenhauers second major departure from Kants epistemology concerns the body</span>
				<span class='text'>Kants philosophy was formulated as a response to the radical  of David Hume who claimed that causality could not be observed empirically</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer begins by arguing that Kants demarcation between external objects knowable only as phenomena and the Thing in Itself of noumenon contains a significant omission</span>
				<span class='text'>There is in fact one physical object we know more intimately than we know any object of sense perception our own body</span>
				<span class='text'>e know our  have boundaries and occupy space the same way other objects known only through our named senses do</span>
				<span class='text'>Though we seldom think of our body as a physical object we know even before lection that it shares some of an objects properties</span>
				<span class='text'>We understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own body we would obtain similar results ‚Äì we know this even if we do not understand the  involved</span>
				<span class='text'>e know that our consciousness inhabits a physical body similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion</span>
				<span class='text'>We usually are not aware of the breathing of our  or the beating of our  unless somehow our attention is called to them</span>
				<span class='text'>Our ability to control either is limited</span>
				<span class='text'>Our s command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose</span>
				<span class='text'>Few of us have any idea what our  is doing right now though this organ is as needful as lungs heart or kidneys</span>
				<span class='text'>The conscious mind is the servant not the master of these and other organs these organs have an agenda which the conscious mind did not choose and over which it has limited power</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Schopenhauer identifies the noumenon with the desires needs and impulses in us that we name will what he is saying is that we participate in the reality of an otherwise unachievable world outside the mind through will</span>
				<span class='text'>We cannot prove that our mental picture of an outside world corresponds with a reality by reasoning through will we know ‚Äì without thinking ‚Äì that the world can stimulate us</span>
				<span class='text'>We suffer fear or desire these states arise involuntarily they arise prior to lection they arise even when the conscious mind would per to hold them at bay</span>
				<span class='text'>The rational mind is for Schopenhauer a leaf borne along in a stream of pre lective and largely unconscious emotion</span>
				<span class='text'>That stream is will and through will if not through logic we can participate in the underlying reality beyond mere phenomena</span>
				<span class='text'>It is for this reason that Schopenhauer identifies the noumenon with what we call our will</span>
				<span class='text'>n his criticism of Kant Schopenhauer claimed that sensation and understanding are separate and distinct abilities</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet for Kant an object is known through each of them</span>
				<span class='text'>Kant wrote </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>There are two stems of human knowledge </span>

				<span class='text'>namely sensibility and understanding objects being given by the former sensibility and thought by the latter understanding</span>

				<span class='text'>He asserted that mere sense impressions not objects are given by sensibility</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Schopenhauer objects are intuitively perceived by understanding and are discursively thought by reason Kant had claimed that 1 the understanding thinks objects through concepts and that 2 reason seeks the unconditioned or ultimate answer to why</span>

				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer expressed his dislike for the philosophy of his contemporary  many times in his published works</span>
				<span class='text'>The following quotations are typicalIf I were to say that the so called philosophy of this fellow Hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times that it is a  paralyzing all mental powers stifling all real thinking and by the most outrageous misuse of language putting in its place the hollowest most senseless thoughtless and as is confirmed by its success most stupefying verbiage I should be quite right</span>

				<span class='text'>In his Foreword to the first edition of his work Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik Schopenhauer suggested that he had shown Hegel to have fallen prey to the  fallacy</span>
				<span class='text'>chopenhauer suggested that Hegels works were filled with castles of abstraction and that Hegel used deliberately impressive but ultimately vacuous verbiage</span>

				<span class='text'> Criticism of Schopenhauers personal life The British philosopher and historian  deemed Schopenhauer an insincere person because judging by his lifeHe habitually dined well at a good restaurant he had many trivial love affairs which were sensual but not passionate he was exceedingly quarrelsome and unusually avaricious</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>It is hard to find in his life evidences of any virtue except kindness to animals </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>In all other respects he was completely selfish</span>
				<span class='text'>It is difficult to believe that a man who was profoundly convinced of the virtue of  and resignation would never have made any attempt to embody his convictions in his practice</span>
				<span class='text'>name Insincere  points out that the answer to such shallow but not uncommon criticism is found in a quotation from SchopenhauerIt is theore just as little necessary for the saint to be a philosopher as for the philosopher to be a saint just as it is not necessary for a perfectly beautiful person to be a great sculptor or for a great sculptor to be himself a beautiful person</span>
				<span class='text'>In general it is a strange demand on a moralist that he should commend no other virtue than that which he himself possesses</span>
				<span class='text'>To repeat abstractly universally and distinctly in concepts the whole inner nature of the world and thus to deposit it as a lected image in permanent concepts always ready for the faculty of reason this and nothing else is philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>he Philosophy of Schopenhauer Oxford University Press pg 211  Influence Schopenhauer has had a massive influence upon later thinkers though more so in the  especially literature and music and  than in philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>His popularity peaked in the early twentieth century especially during the  era and waned somewhat thereafter</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless a number of recent publications have reinterpreted and modernised the study of Schopenhauer</span>
				<span class='text'>His theory is also being explored by some modern philosophers as a precursor to  and modern evolutionary psychology</span>
				<span class='text'>n the book Straw Dogs John Gray upheld Schopenhauer as one of the few philosophers who has dedicated himself to studying Eastern philosophy as well as Western philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>The book argues against free will and states that humans have much more in common with animals than is commonly admitted in the West</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer is praised for his attitude towards animals and for having addressed the brutality of much of human life</span>
				<span class='text'>Russian writer and philosopher  was greatly influenced by Schopenhauer</span>
				<span class='text'>After reading Schopenhauers The World as Will and Representation Tolstoy gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes Do you know what this summer has meant for me Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and a whole series of spiritual delights which Ive never experienced before</span>
