				<span class='text'>peg|thumb|Schopenhauer in 1815, second of the critical five years of the initial composition of ''Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung'']]A key focus of Schopenhauer was his investigation of individual motivation</span>
				<span class='text'>Before Schopenhauer, Hegel had popularized the concept of ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', the idea that society consisted of a [[collective consciousness]] which moved in a distinct direction, dictating the actions of its members</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer, a reader of both Kant and Hegel, criticized their logical optimism and the belief that individual morality could be determined by society and reason</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer believed that humans were motivated by only their own basic desires, or {{lang|de|''Wille zum Leben''}} (&quot;Will to Live&quot;), which directed all of mankind</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;The reality is what Schopenhauer calls the Will, the Will to Live</span>

				<span class='text'>Lyon, 1 August 1949, [[George Santayana]], ''The Letters of George Santayana'', Scribner's, New York, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;For Schopenhauer, human desire was futile, illogical, directionless, and, by extension, so was all human action in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote &quot;Man can indeed do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wants&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In this sense, he adhered to the Fichtean principle of idealism: &quot;the world is ''for'' a subject&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>This idealism so presented, immediately commits it to an ethical attitude, unlike the purely epistemological concerns of [[Descartes]] and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;inveigles&quot;/&gt; He is credited with one of the most famous opening lines of philosophy: &quot;The world is my representation&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Will, for Schopenhauer, is what Kant called the &quot;[[Noumenon|thing-in-itself]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;But like Fichte, he rejects the Kantian claim that the thing-in-itself as an unknowable substratum of experience</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer's argument is that the thing in-itself in Kant is an incoherent sense of object: it is the opposite to objects, and yet it is said to be an object-in-itself: &quot;the phantom of a dream&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Nietzsche]] was greatly influenced by this idea of Will, while developing it in a different direction</span>
				<span class='text'>== Art and aesthetics ==={{Main|Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics}}For Schopenhauer, human desiring, &quot;willing,&quot; and craving cause [[suffering|suffering or pain]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation (a method comparable to [[Zapffe]]'s &quot;''Sublimation''&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this pain‚Äîalbeit temporarily‚Äîbecause it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception (therefore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds; time, space and causality) from which one is separated; rather one becomes one with that perception: &quot;''one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception''&quot; (''The World as Will and Representation'', section 34)</span>
				<span class='text'>From this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a &quot;''subject of cognition''&quot; to a perception that is &quot;''Pure, will-less, timeless''&quot; (section 34) where the essence, &quot;ideas,&quot; of the world are shown</span>
				<span class='text'>Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one's immersion with the world, thus tries to depict the essence/pure ideas of the world</span>
				<span class='text'>Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds, therefore as an individual object</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Daniel Albright, &quot;Schopenhauer thought that [[philosophy of music|music]] was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Albright, Modernism and Music, 2004, page 39, footnote 34&lt;/ref&gt;He deemed music to be a timeless, universal language which is comprehended everywhere, and can imbue global enthusiasm, if in possession of a significant melody</span>

				<span class='text'>Writing shortly before the logical independence of the axiom was demonstrated by the discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]], and long before the [[general theory of relativity]] revealed that it does not express a property of physical space, Schopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to prove from indirect [[concept]]s that which he held to be directly evident from [[perception]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{quote|text=The Euclidean method of demonstration has brought forth from its own womb its most striking parody and caricature in the famous controversy over the theory of ''parallels'', and in the attempts, repeated every year, to prove the eleventh axiom&lt;ref&gt;What Schopenhauer calls the eleventh axiom is Euclid's Fifth Postulate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; (also known as the fifth postulate)</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[axiom]] asserts, and that indeed through the indirect criterion of a third intersecting line, that two lines inclined to each other (for this is the precise meaning of &quot;less than two right angles&quot;), if produced far enough, must meet</span>
				<span class='text'>Now this truth is supposed to be too complicated to pass as self-evident, and therefore needs a proof; but no such proof can be produced, just because there is nothing more immediate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2, chap</span>
				<span class='text'>13&lt;/ref&gt;}} Throughout his writings,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I wanted in this way to stress and demonstrate the great difference, indeed opposition, between knowledge of perception and abstract or reflected knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>Hitherto this difference has received too little attention, and its establishment is a fundamental feature of my philosophy‚Ä¶&quot; ''Ibid</span>
				<span class='text'>', chap</span>
				<span class='text'>7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts, instead of from intuitive perceptions</span>
				<span class='text'>{quote|text=In fact, it seems to me that the logical method is in this way reduced to an absurdity</span>
				<span class='text'>But it is precisely through the controversies over this, together with the futile attempts to demonstrate the ''directly'' certain as merely ''indirectly'' certain, that the independence and clearness of intuitive evidence appear in contrast with the uselessness and difficulty of logical proof, a contrast as instructive as it is amusing</span>
				<span class='text'>The direct certainty will not be admitted here, just because it is no merely logical certainty following from the concept, and thus resting solely on the relation of predicate to subject, according to the principle of contradiction</span>
				<span class='text'>But that eleventh axiom regarding parallel lines is a [[synthetic proposition]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', and as such has the guarantee of pure, not empirical, perception; this perception is just as immediate and certain as is the [[principle of contradiction]] itself, from which all proofs originally derive their certainty</span>
				<span class='text'>At bottom this holds good of every geometrical theorem &amp;hellip;</span>
				<span class='text'>}Although Schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove Euclid's parallel postulate, he did see a reason for examining another of Euclid's axioms</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;This comment by Schopenhauer was called &quot;an acute observation&quot; by [[T</span>

				<span class='text'>In his translation of [[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]], vol</span>
				<span class='text'>1, Book I, &quot;Note on Common Notion 4,&quot; Heath made this judgment and also noted that Schopenhauer's remark &quot;was a criticism in advance of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz']] theory</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Helmholtz had &quot;maintained that geometry requires us to assume the actual existence of rigid bodies and their free mobility in space &amp;hellip;&quot; and is therefore &quot;dependent on mechanics</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|text=It surprises me that the eighth axiom,&lt;ref&gt;What Schopenhauer calls the eighth axiom is Euclid's Common Notion 4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Figures that coincide with one another are equal to one another,&quot; is not rather attacked</span>
				<span class='text'>For &quot;''coinciding with one another''&quot; is either a mere [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], or something quite [[empirical]], belonging not to pure intuition or perception, but to external sensuous experience</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus it presupposes mobility of the figures, but [[matter]] alone is movable in [[space]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently, this reference to coincidence with one another forsakes pure space, the sole element of [[geometry]], in order to pass over to the material and empirical</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;}}This follows [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reasoning</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;‚ÄùMotion of an ''object'' in space does not belong in a pure science, and consequently not in geometry</span>
				<span class='text'>For the fact that something is movable cannot be cognized ''a priori'', but can be cognized only through experience</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù (Kant, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'',  B 155, Note)&lt;/ref&gt;=== Ethics ===Schopenhauer's moral theory proposed that only [[compassion]] can drive moral acts</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Schopenhauer, compassion alone is the good of the object of the acts, that is, they cannot be inspired by either the prospect of personal utility or the feeling of duty</span>
				<span class='text'>Mankind can also be guided by [[Ethical egoism|egoism]] and [[wikt:malice|malice]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Egotistic acts are those guided by self-interest, desire for pleasure or happiness</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer believed most of our deeds belong to this class</span>
				<span class='text'>Acts of malice are different from egotistic acts</span>
				<span class='text'>As in the case of acts of compassion, these do not target personal utility</span>
				<span class='text'>Their aim is to cause damage to others, independently of personal gains</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed, like [[Swami Vivekananda]] in the unity of all with one-self and also believed that ego is the origin of pain and conflicts, that reduction of ego frames the moral principles</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A definite action inevitably results when a particular motive influences a person's given, unchangeable character</span>
				<span class='text'>he State, Schopenhauer claimed, punishes criminals in order to prevent future crimes</span>
				<span class='text'>It does so by placing &quot;beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone, in the inescapable punishment</span>

				<span class='text'>All retaliation for wrong by inflicting a pain without any object for the future is revenge, and can have no other purpose than consolation for the suffering one has endured by the sight of the suffering one has caused in another</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Political and social thought ======= Politics ====[[File:FFM Wallanlagen Schopenhauer-Denkmal</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Bust in [[Frankfurt am Main]]]]Schopenhauer's politics were, for the most part, an echo of his system of ethics (the latter being expressed in ''Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik'', available in English as two separate books, ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'' and ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Ethics also occupies about one quarter of his central work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>n occasional political comments in his ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' and ''Manuscript Remains'', Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of [[limited government]]</span>
				<span class='text'>What was essential, he thought, was that the state should &quot;leave each man free to work out his own [[salvation]]&quot;, and so long as government was thus limited, he would &quot;prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [his] fellow rats&quot; ‚Äî i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> by a [[monarch]], rather than a [[Republic|democrat]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer shared the view of [[Thomas Hobbes]] on the necessity of the state, and of state action, to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species</span>
				<span class='text'>He also defended the independence of the legislative, judicial and executive branches of power, and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice (in a practical and everyday sense, not a cosmological one)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2, Ch</span>
				<span class='text'>47&lt;/ref&gt; He declared monarchy as &quot;that which is natural to man&quot; for &quot;intelligence has always under a monarchical government a much better chance against its irreconcilable and ever-present foe, stupidity&quot; and disparaged republicanism as &quot;unnatural as it is unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and the arts and sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Government (Schopenhauer)]]&lt;/ref&gt;Schopenhauer, by his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he writes proudly of how little attention he had paid &quot;to political affairs of [his] day&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he did indeed maintain his aloof position of &quot;minding not the times but the eternities&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> He wrote many disparaging remarks about Germany and the Germans</span>
				<span class='text'>A typical example is, &quot;For a German it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth, for he thinks slowly, and they give him time to reflect</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>2, Ch</span>
				<span class='text'>12&lt;/ref&gt;Schopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern &quot;white races&quot; due to their sensitivity and creativity (except for the ancient Egyptians and Hindus whom he saw as equal):&lt;blockquote&gt;The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands</span>
				<span class='text'>All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate</span>
				<span class='text'>This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume II, Section 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Despite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>He describes the treatment of &quot;[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches&quot; as &quot;belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', &quot;On Ethics,&quot; Sec</span>
				<span class='text'>5&lt;/ref&gt;Schopenhauer additionally maintained a marked metaphysical and political [[anti-Judaism]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Schopenhauer argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against the materialistic basis of Judaism, exhibiting an Indian-influenced ethics reflecting the [[Aryan]]-[[Vedas|Vedic]] theme of spiritual &quot;self-conquest</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  This he saw as opposed to what he held to be the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly Jewish spirit:&lt;blockquote&gt;While all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life, the religion of the Jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war-cry in the struggle with other nations</span>

				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer wrote that &quot;Women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish, frivolous and short-sighted&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Schopenhauer at age 58 on 16 May 1846]]Schopenhauer believed that personality and [[intellect]] were inherited</span>
				<span class='text'>He quotes Horace's saying, &quot;From the brave and good are the brave descended&quot; (''Odes'', iv, 4, 29) and Shakespeare's line from ''[[Cymbeline]]'', &quot;Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base&quot; (IV, 2) to reinforce his hereditarian argument</span>

				<span class='text'>II, p</span>
				<span class='text'>519&lt;/ref&gt;Mechanistically, Schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his level of intellect through his mother, and personal character through one's father</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;On the Suffering of the World, (1970), Page 35</span>
				<span class='text'>Penguin Books-Great Ideas&lt;/ref&gt;This belief in heritability of traits informed Schopenhauer's view of love ‚Äì placing it at the highest level of importance</span>
				<span class='text'>For Schopenhauer the &quot;final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life</span>
				<span class='text'>What it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on [[eugenics]] or good breeding</span>
				<span class='text'>Here Schopenhauer wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;With our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation</span>
				<span class='text'>Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his ''Republic'', he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste</span>
				<span class='text'>If we could [[castrate]] all [[criminals|scoundrels]] and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole [[harem]], and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of [[Pericles]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For him, all individual animals, including humans, are essentially the same, being phenomenal manifestations of the one underlying Will</span>
				<span class='text'>The word &quot;will&quot; designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct, inner experience</span>
				<span class='text'>Since every living thing possesses will, then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;Unlike the intellect, it [the Will] does not depend on the perfection of the organism, but is essentially the same in all animals as that which is known to us so intimately</span>
				<span class='text'>Accordingly, the animal has all the emotions of humans, such as joy, grief, fear, anger, love, hatred, strong desire, envy, and so on</span>
				<span class='text'>The great difference between human and animal rests solely on the intellect's degrees of perfection</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; ''On the Will in Nature'', &quot;Physiology and Pathology</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, he claimed that a good person would have sympathy for animals, who are our fellow sufferers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;blockquote&gt;Compassion for animals is intimately associated with goodness of character, and it may be confidently asserted that he who is cruel to living creatures cannot be a good man</span>

				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer even went so far as to protest against the use of the pronoun &quot;it&quot; in reference to animals because it led to the treatment of them as though they were inanimate things</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>n English all animals are of the neuter gender and so are represented by the pronoun 'it,' just as if they were inanimate things</span>
				<span class='text'>The effect of this artifice is quite revolting, especially in the case of primates, such as dogs, monkeys, and the like</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&quot; ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', ¬ß 19</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; To reinforce his points, Schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of a monkey who had been shot&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I recall having read of an Englishman who, while hunting in India, had shot a monkey; he could not forget the look which the dying animal gave him, and since then had never again fired at monkeys</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', ¬ß 19</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;[Sir William Harris] describes how he shot his first elephant, a female</span>
				<span class='text'>The next morning he went to look for the dead animal; all the other elephants had fled from the neighborhood except a young one, who had spent the night with its dead mother</span>
				<span class='text'>Forgetting all fear, he came toward the sportsmen with the clearest and liveliest evidence of inconsolable grief, and put his tiny trunk round them in order to appeal to them for help</span>
				<span class='text'>Harris says he was then filled with real remorse for what he had done, and felt as if he had committed a murder</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', ¬ß 19</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;He was very attached to his succession of pet poodles</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer criticized [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;His contempt for animals, who, as mere things for our use, are declared by him to be without rights,</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&quot; This is the exact opposite of Schopenhauer's doctrine</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, ''ibid</span>
				<span class='text'>', Appendix, 26, &quot;whatsoever there be in nature beside man, a regard for our advantage does not call on us to preserve, but to preserve or destroy according to its various capacities, and to adapt to our use as best we may</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Such are the matters which I engage to prove in Prop</span>
				<span class='text'>xviii of this Part, whereby it is plain that the law against the slaughtering of animals is founded rather on vain superstition and womanish pity than on sound reason</span>
				<span class='text'>The rational quest of what is useful to us further teaches us the necessity of associating ourselves with our fellow-men, but not with beasts, or things, whose nature is different from our own; we have the same rights in respect to them as they have in respect to us</span>
				<span class='text'>Nay, as everyone's right is defined by his virtue, or power, men have far greater rights over beasts than beasts have over men</span>
				<span class='text'>Still I affirm that beasts feel</span>
				<span class='text'>But I also affirm that we may consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in the way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours, and their emotions are naturally different from human emotions</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==== Views on homosexuality and pederasty ====In the third, expanded edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'' (1859), Schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the &quot;Metaphysics of Sexual Love&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He also wrote that homosexuality did have the benefit of preventing ill-begotten children</span>
				<span class='text'>Concerning this, he stated, &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature, and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her, it must in fact serve these very aims, although only indirectly, as a means for preventing greater evils</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=566}}</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote that only those who were too old or too young to reproduce strong, healthy children would resort to pederasty (Schopenhauer considered pederasty to be in itself a [[vice]])</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;The World as Will and Representation: Volume Two&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Dover&lt;/ref&gt; Shrewdly anticipating the interpretive distortion, on the part of the popular mind, of his attempted scientific ''explanation'' of [[pederasty]] as personal ''advocacy'' (when he had otherwise described the act, in terms of spiritual ethics, as an &quot;objectionable aberration&quot;), Schopenhauer sarcastically concludes the appendix with the statement that &quot;by expounding these paradoxical ideas, I wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour, for they are very disconcerted by the ever-increasing publicization of my philosophy which they so carefully concealed</span>
				<span class='text'>I have done so by giving them the opportunity of slandering me by saying that I defend and commend pederasty</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=567}}&lt;/ref&gt;=== Intellectual interests and affinities ======= Indology ====Schopenhauer read the Latin translation of the [[Upanisad|Upanishads]] which had been translated by French writer [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Anquetil du Perron]] from the Persian translation of Prince [[Dara Shikoh]] entitled ''Sirre-Akbar'' (&quot;The Great Secret&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>He was so impressed by their philosophy that he called them &quot;the production of the highest human wisdom,&quot; and considered them to contain superhuman conceptions</span>
				<span class='text'>The Upanishads was a great source of inspiration to Schopenhauer, and writing about them he said:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the most satisfying and elevating reading (with the exception of the original text) which is possible in the world; it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=John James|title=Oriental enlightenment|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|page=68|isbn=978-0-415-13376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It is well known that the book ''Oupnekhat'' (Upanishad) always lay open on his table, and he invariably studied it before sleeping at night</span>
				<span class='text'>He called the opening up of Sanskrit literature &quot;the greatest gift of our century&quot;, and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the Upanishads would become the cherished faith of the West</span>

				<span class='text'>They met during the winter of 1813‚Äì1814 in [[Weimar]] at the home of Schopenhauer's mother according to the biographer Sanfranski</span>
				<span class='text'>Majer was a follower of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], and an early [[Indologist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814</span>
				<span class='text'>Sansfranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian thought in [[Dresden]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was through his neighbor of two years, [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom</span>
				<span class='text'>Krause had also mastered [[Sanskrit]], unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned [[meditation]] and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning Indian thought</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Christopher McCoy, 3‚Äì4&lt;/ref&gt;Most noticeable, in the case of Schopenhauer‚Äôs work, was the significance of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], whose [[Mahavakya]], [[Tat Tvam Asi]] is mentioned throughout ''The World as Will and Representation''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Christopher McCoy, 54‚Äì56&lt;/ref&gt;==== Buddhism ====Schopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering, that suffering is caused by desire ([[ta·πáhƒÅ]]), and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus three of the four &quot;truths of the Buddha&quot; correspond to Schopenhauer's doctrine of the will</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Janaway|Janaway]], Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>28&amp;nbsp;f</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhism, however, while greed and lust are always unskillful, desire is ethically variable ‚Äì it can be skillful, unskillful, or neutral</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; Ashgate Publishing, Ltd</span>
				<span class='text'> 2004, page 22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;For Schopenhauer, Will had [[ontology|ontological]] primacy over the [[intellect]]; in other words, desire is understood to be prior to thought</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of [[puru·π£ƒÅrtha]] or goals of life in [[VedƒÅnta]] [[Hinduism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n Schopenhauer's philosophy, denial of the will is attained by either:* personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live; or* knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, Buddhist [[nirvƒÅ·πáa]] is not equivalent to the condition that Schopenhauer described as denial of the will</span>
				<span class='text'>NirvƒÅ·πáa is not the extinguishing of the ''person'' as some Western scholars have thought, but only the &quot;extinguishing&quot; (the literal meaning of nirvana) of the flames of greed, hatred, and delusion that assail a person's character</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Occult historian [[Joscelyn Godwin]] (1945‚Äì ) stated, &quot;It was Buddhism that inspired the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, and, through him, attracted [[Richard Wagner]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Godwin, J: ''Arktos: The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, and Nazi Survival'', page 38</span>
				<span class='text'>Adventures Unlimited Press, 1996, ISBN 978-0-932813-35-0&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Orientalism]] reflected the struggle of the German Romantics, in the words of [[Leon Poliakov]], to free themselves from [[Judeo-Christian]] fetters&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Arktos'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>38</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In contradistinction to Godwin's claim that Buddhism inspired Schopenhauer, the philosopher himself made the following statement in his discussion of religions:&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Schopenhauer is often said to be the first, or indeed the only, modern Western philosopher of any note to attempt any integration of his work with Eastern ways of thinking</span>
				<span class='text'>That he was the first is surely true, but the claim that he was ''influenced'' by Indian thought needs some qualification</span>
				<span class='text'>There is a remarkable correspondence, at least in broad terms, between some of the central Schopenhauerian doctrines and Buddhism: notably in the views that empirical existence is suffering, that suffering originates in desires, and that salvation can be attained by the extinction of desires</span>
				<span class='text'>These three 'truths of the Buddha' are mirrored closely in the essential structure of the doctrine of the will (On this, see Dorothea W</span>
				<span class='text'>Dauer, ''Schopenhauer as Transmitter of Buddhist Ideas''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If I wished to take the results of my philosophy as the standard of truth, I should have to concede to Buddhism pre-eminence over the others</span>
				<span class='text'>In any case, it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own, for this numbers far more followers than any other</span>
				<span class='text'>And this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as ''in my philosophizing I have certainly not been under its influence'' [emphasis added]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Schopenhauer in March 1859]]=== Critique of the Kantian philosophy ==={{Main|Critique of the Kantian philosophy}}{{See also|On the Basis of Morality|Schopenhauer's criticism of Kant's schemata}}Schopenhauer accepted Kant's double-aspect of the universe ‚Äì the [[phenomena]]l (world of experience) and the [[noumenon|noumenal]] (the true world, independent of experience)</span>
				<span class='text'>Some commentators suggest that Schopenhauer claimed that the noumenon, or thing-in-itself, was the basis for Schopenhauer's concept of the [[will (philosophy)|will]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Other commentators suggest that Schopenhauer considered [[will (philosophy)|will]] to be only a subset of the &quot;thing-in-itself&quot; class, namely that which we can most directly experience</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bryan Magee, ''Misunderstanding Schopenhauer'', [[Institute of Germanic and Romance Studies]], University of London, 1990, ISBN 978-0-85457-148-2&lt;/ref&gt;Schopenhauer's identification of the Kantian ''noumenon'' (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> the actually existing entity) with what he termed &quot;will&quot; deserves some explanation</span>
				<span class='text'>The noumenon was what Kant called the ''Ding an sich'' (the Thing in Itself), the reality that is the foundation of our [[sense|sensory]] and [[mind|mental]] representations of an external world</span>
				<span class='text'>In Kantian terms, those sensory and mental representations are mere phenomena</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer departed from Kant in his description of the relationship between the phenomenon and the noumenon</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Kant, things-in-themselves ground the phenomenal representations in our minds; Schopenhauer, on the other hand, believed phenomena and noumena to be two different sides of the same coin</span>
				<span class='text'>Noumena do not ''cause'' phenomena, but rather phenomena are simply the way by which our minds perceive the noumena, according to the [[principle of sufficient reason]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This is explained more fully in Schopenhauer's doctoral thesis, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>chopenhauer's second major departure from Kant's epistemology concerns the body</span>
				<span class='text'>Kant's philosophy was formulated as a response to the radical [[philosophical skepticism]] of David Hume, who claimed that causality could not be observed empirically</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer begins by arguing that Kant's demarcation between external objects, knowable only as phenomena, and the Thing in Itself of noumenon, contains a significant omission</span>
				<span class='text'>There is, in fact, one physical object we know more intimately than we know any object of sense perception: our own body</span>
				<span class='text'>e know our [[human anatomy|human bodies]] have boundaries and occupy space, the same way other objects known only through our named senses do</span>
				<span class='text'>Though we seldom think of our body as a physical object, we know even before reflection that it shares some of an object's properties</span>
				<span class='text'>We understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck; we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own body, we would obtain similar results ‚Äì we know this even if we do not understand the [[physics]] involved</span>
				<span class='text'>e know that our consciousness inhabits a physical body, similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion</span>
				<span class='text'>We usually are not aware of the breathing of our [[human lung|lungs]] or the beating of our [[human heart|heart]] unless somehow our attention is called to them</span>
				<span class='text'>Our ability to control either is limited</span>
				<span class='text'>Our [[kidney]]s command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose</span>
				<span class='text'>Few of us have any idea what our [[liver]] is doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys</span>
				<span class='text'>The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs; these organs have an agenda which the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Schopenhauer identifies the ''noumenon'' with the desires, needs, and impulses in us that we name &quot;will,&quot; what he is saying is that we participate in the reality of an otherwise unachievable world outside the mind through will</span>
				<span class='text'>We cannot ''prove'' that our mental picture of an outside world corresponds with a reality by reasoning; through will, we know ‚Äì without thinking ‚Äì that the world can stimulate us</span>
				<span class='text'>We suffer fear, or desire: these states arise involuntarily; they arise prior to reflection; they arise even when the conscious mind would prefer to hold them at bay</span>
				<span class='text'>The rational mind is, for Schopenhauer, a leaf borne along in a stream of pre-reflective and largely unconscious emotion</span>
				<span class='text'>That stream is will, and through will, if not through logic, we can participate in the underlying reality beyond mere phenomena</span>
				<span class='text'>It is for this reason that Schopenhauer identifies the ''noumenon'' with what we call our will</span>
				<span class='text'>n his criticism of Kant, Schopenhauer claimed that sensation and understanding are separate and distinct abilities</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet, for Kant, an object is known through each of them</span>
				<span class='text'>Kant wrote: &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[T]here are two stems of human knowledge </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>namely, sensibility and understanding, objects being given by the former [sensibility] and thought by the latter [understanding]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 15&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer disagreed</span>
				<span class='text'>He asserted that mere sense impressions, not objects, are given by sensibility</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Schopenhauer, objects are intuitively perceived by understanding and are discursively thought by reason (Kant had claimed that (1) the understanding thinks objects through concepts and that (2) reason seeks the unconditioned or ultimate answer to &quot;why?&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer said that Kant's mistake regarding perception resulted in all of the obscurity and difficult confusion that is exhibited in the Transcendental Analytic section of his critique</span>
				<span class='text'>astly, Schopenhauer departed from Kant in how he interpreted the [[Platonic forms|Platonic ideas]]</span>
				<span class='text'> In ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' Schopenhauer explicitly stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ant used the word [Idea] wrongly as well as illegitimately, although Plato had already taken possession of it, and used it most appropriately</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;Instead Schopenhauer relied upon the [[Neoplatonist]] interpretation of the biographer [[Diogenes La√´rtius]] from ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In reference to Plato‚Äôs Ideas, Schopenhauer quotes La√´rtius verbatim in an explanatory footnote</span>
				<span class='text'>iogenes La√´rtius (III, 12) Plato ideas in natura velut exemplaria dixit subsistere; cetera his esse similia, ad istarum similitudinem consistencia</span>
				<span class='text'>Plato teaches that the Ideas exist in nature, so to speak, as patterns or prototypes, and that the remainder of things only resemble them, and exist as their copies</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Critique of Hegel ===Schopenhauer expressed his dislike for the philosophy of his contemporary [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] many times in his published works</span>
				<span class='text'>The following quotations are typical::If I were to say that the so-called philosophy of this fellow Hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a [[pseudophilosophy|pseudo-philosophy]] paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, I should be quite right</span>
				<span class='text'>Further, if I were to say that this summus philosophus [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> scribbled nonsense quite unlike any mortal before him, so that whoever could read his most eulogized work, the so-called ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of the Mind]]'', without feeling as if he were in a madhouse, would qualify as an inmate for [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]], I should be no less right</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[On the Basis of Morality]], pp</span>
				<span class='text'>15‚Äì16</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;:At first Fichte and Schelling shine as the heroes of this epoch; to be followed by the man who is quite unworthy even of them, and greatly their inferior in point of talent --- I mean the stupid and clumsy charlatan Hegel</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[On the Basis of Morality]], p</span>
				<span class='text'>35</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In his Foreword to the first edition of his work ''Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik'', Schopenhauer suggested that he had shown Hegel to have fallen prey to the ''[[Post hoc ergo propter hoc]]'' fallacy</span>
				<span class='text'>chopenhauer suggested that Hegel's works were filled with &quot;castles of abstraction,&quot; and that Hegel used deliberately impressive but ultimately vacuous verbiage</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;orientalia</span>
				<span class='text'>rg&quot;/&gt; For instance, the [[Right Hegelians]] interpreted Hegel as viewing the Prussian state of his day as perfect and the goal of all history up until then</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the Hegelians who, in complete unsmiling seriousness, were airing the question of what the further content of world history could possibly be, now that in the Hegelian philosophy the world spirit had reached the goal, the knowledge of itself</span>

				<span class='text'>256</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;== Criticism of Schopenhauer's personal life ==The British philosopher and historian [[Bertrand Russell]] deemed Schopenhauer an insincere person, because judging by his life::&quot;He habitually dined well, at a good restaurant; he had many trivial love-affairs, which were sensual but not passionate; he was exceedingly quarrelsome and unusually avaricious</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>It is hard to find in his life evidences of any virtue except kindness to animals </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>In all other respects he was completely selfish</span>
				<span class='text'>It is difficult to believe that a man who was profoundly convinced of the virtue of [[asceticism]] and resignation would never have made any attempt to embody his convictions in his practice</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Insincere&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=HISTORY OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY|year=1946|publisher=George Allen and Unwin LTD|location=Start of 2nd paragraph|pages=786}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Bryan Magee]] points out that &quot;the answer to such shallow, but not uncommon criticism&quot; is found in a quotation from Schopenhauer::&quot;It is therefore just as little necessary for the saint to be a philosopher as for the philosopher to be a saint; just as it is not necessary for a perfectly beautiful person to be a great sculptor, or for a great sculptor to be himself a beautiful person</span>
				<span class='text'>In general, it is a strange demand on a moralist that he should commend no other virtue than that which he himself possesses</span>
				<span class='text'>To repeat abstractly, universally, and distinctly in concepts the whole inner nature of the world, and thus to deposit it as a reflected image in permanent concepts always ready for the faculty of reason, this and nothing else is philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Philosophy of Schopenhauer, Oxford University Press, pg 211&lt;/ref&gt;== Influence ==[[File:Arthur Schopenhauer by Wilhelm Busch</span>
				<span class='text'>peg|thumb|upright|Caricature of Schopenhauer by [[Wilhelm Busch]] (1832‚Äì1908)]]Schopenhauer has had a massive influence upon later thinkers, though more so in the [[arts]] (especially literature and music) and [[psychology]] than in philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>His popularity peaked in the early twentieth century, especially during the [[Modernist]] era, and waned somewhat thereafter</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, a number of recent publications have reinterpreted and modernised the study of Schopenhauer</span>
				<span class='text'>His theory is also being explored by some modern philosophers as a precursor to [[evolutionary theory]] and modern evolutionary psychology</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In the book ''Straw Dogs'', John Gray upheld Schopenhauer as one of the few philosophers who has dedicated himself to studying Eastern philosophy as well as Western philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>The book argues against free will, and states that humans have much more in common with animals than is commonly admitted in the West</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer is praised for his attitude towards animals, and for having addressed the brutality of much of human life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Russian writer and philosopher [[Leo Tolstoy]] was greatly influenced by Schopenhauer</span>
				<span class='text'>After reading Schopenhauer's ''The World as Will and Representation'', Tolstoy gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes: &quot;Do you know what this summer has meant for me? Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and a whole series of spiritual delights which I've never experienced before</span>
