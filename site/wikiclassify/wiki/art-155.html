				<span class='text'>gg}}; 12 December 1863 – 23 January 1944) was a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] [[painting|painter]] and [[printmaker]] whose intensely evocative treatment of psychological themes built upon some of the main tenets of late 19th-century [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and greatly influenced [[German Expressionism]] in the early 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his most well-known works is ''[[The Scream]]'' of 1893</span>
				<span class='text'>=Life===== Childhood ===Edvard Munch was born in a farmhouse in the village of [[Ådalsbruk]] in [[Løten]], Norway, to Laura Catherine Bjølstad and Christian Munch, the son of a priest</span>
				<span class='text'>Christian was a doctor and medical officer who married Laura, a woman half his age, in 1861</span>
				<span class='text'>Edvard had an elder sister, Johanne Sophie, and three younger siblings: Peter Andreas, Laura Catherine, and Inger Marie</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Sophie and Edvard appear to have inherited their artistic talent from their mother</span>
				<span class='text'>Edvard Munch was related to painter [[Jacob Munch]] and historian [[Peter Andreas Munch]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;The family moved to Christiania (now [[Oslo]]) in 1864 when Christian Munch was appointed medical officer at [[Akershus Fortress]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Edvard's mother died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1868, as did Munch's favorite sister Johanne Sophie in 1877</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Eg_p16&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their mother's death, the Munch siblings were raised by their father and by their aunt Karen</span>
				<span class='text'>Often ill for much of the winters and kept out of school, Edvard would draw to keep himself occupied</span>
				<span class='text'>He was tutored by his school mates and his aunt</span>
				<span class='text'>Christian Munch also instructed his son in history and literature, and entertained the children with vivid ghost-stories and the tales of American writer [[Edgar Allan Poe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;As Edvard remembered it, Christian's positive behavior toward his children was overshadowed by his morbid [[pietism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Munch wrote, &quot;My father was temperamentally nervous and obsessively religious—to the point of psychoneurosis</span>
				<span class='text'>From him I inherited the seeds of madness</span>
				<span class='text'>The angels of fear, sorrow, and death stood by my side since the day I was born</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian reprimanded his children by telling them that their mother was looking down from heaven and grieving over their misbehavior</span>
				<span class='text'>The oppressive religious milieu, plus Edvard's poor health and the vivid ghost stories, helped inspire his macabre visions and nightmares; the boy felt that death was constantly advancing on him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Munch's younger sisters was diagnosed with mental illness at an early age</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the five siblings, only Andreas married, but he died a few months after the wedding</span>
				<span class='text'>Munch would later write, &quot;I inherited two of mankind's most frightful enemies—the heritage of consumption and insanity</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;Christian Munch's military pay was very low, and his attempts to develop a private side practice failed, keeping his family in genteel but perennial poverty</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Eg_p16/&gt; They moved frequently from one cheap flat to another</span>
				<span class='text'>Munch's early drawings and watercolors depicted these interiors, and the individual objects, such as medicine bottles and drawing implements, plus some landscapes</span>
				<span class='text'>By his teens, art dominated Munch's interests</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; At thirteen, Munch had his first exposure to other artists at the newly formed Art Association, where he admired the work of the Norwegian landscape school</span>
				<span class='text'>He returned to copy the paintings, and soon he began to paint in oils</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Studies and influences===[[File:Edvard Munch - Self-Portrait (1895) G0192-59 - Google Art Project</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|''Self Portrait with Skeleton Arm'', 1895]]In 1879, Munch enrolled in a [[Institute of technology|technical college]] to study engineering, where he excelled in physics, chemistry and math</span>
				<span class='text'>He learned scaled and perspective drawing, but frequent illnesses interrupted his studies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Pr_p35&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, much to his father's disappointment, Munch left the college determined to become a painter</span>
				<span class='text'>His father viewed art as an &quot;unholy trade&quot;, and his neighbors reacted bitterly and sent him anonymous letters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to his father's rabid pietism, Munch adopted an undogmatic stance toward art</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote his goal in his diary: &quot;in my art I attempt to explain life and its meaning to myself</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Pr_p35/&gt;In 1881, Munch enrolled at the Royal School of Art and Design of Christiania, one of whose founders was his distant relative Jacob Munch</span>
				<span class='text'>His teachers were sculptor [[Julius Middelthun]] and the [[Naturalism (painting)|naturalistic]] painter [[Christian Krohg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Munch demonstrated his quick absorption of his figure training at the Academy in his first portraits, including one of his father and his first self-portrait</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1883, Munch took part in his first public exhibition and shared a studio with other students</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; His full-length portrait of Karl Jensen-Hjell, a notorious bohemian-about-town, earned a critic's dismissive response: &quot;It is impressionism carried to the extreme</span>
				<span class='text'>It is a travesty of art</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Pr_p34&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munch's nude paintings from this period survive only in sketches, except for ''Standing Nude'' (1887)</span>
				<span class='text'>They may have been confiscated by his father</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;During these early years, Munch experimented with many styles, including [[Naturalism (painting)|Naturalism]] and [[Impressionism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Some early works are reminiscent of [[Édouard Manet|Manet]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of these attempts brought him unfavorable criticism from the press and garnered him constant rebukes by his father, who nonetheless provided him with small sums for living expenses</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Pr_p34/&gt; At one point, however, Munch's father, perhaps swayed by the negative opinion of Munch's cousin Edvard Diriks (an established, traditional painter), destroyed at least one painting (likely a nude) and refused to advance any more money for art supplies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;Munch also received his father's ire for his relationship with [[Hans Jæger]], the local nihilist who lived by the code &quot;a passion to destroy is also a creative passion&quot; and who advocated suicide as the ultimate way to freedom</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|pp=71, 74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munch came under his malevolent, anti-establishment spell</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;My ideas developed under the influence of the [[Bohemianism|bohemians]] or rather under Hans Jæger</span>
				<span class='text'>Many people have mistakenly claimed that my ideas were formed under the influence of [[Strindberg]] and the Germans…but that is wrong</span>
				<span class='text'>They had already been formed by then</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, contrary to many of the other bohemians, Munch was still respectful of women, as well as reserved and well-mannered, but he began to give in to the binge drinking and brawling of his circle</span>
				<span class='text'>He was unsettled by the sexual revolution going on at the time and by the independent women around him</span>
				<span class='text'>He later turned cynical concerning sexual matters, expressed not only in his behavior and his art, but in his writings as well, an example being a long poem called ''The City of Free Love''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still dependent on his family for many of his meals, Munch's relationship with his father remained tense over concerns about his bohemian life</span>
				<span class='text'>fter numerous experiments, Munch concluded that the Impressionist idiom did not allow sufficient expression</span>
				<span class='text'>He found it superficial and too akin to scientific experimentation</span>
				<span class='text'>He felt a need to go deeper and explore situations brimming with emotional content and expressive energy</span>
				<span class='text'>Under Jæger's commandment that Munch should &quot;write his life&quot;, meaning that Munch should explore his own emotional and psychological state, the young artist began a period of reflection and self-examination, recording his thoughts in his &quot;soul's diary&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deeper perspective helped move him to a new view of his art</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote that his painting ''[[The Sick Child]]'' (1886), based on his sister's death, was his first &quot;soul painting&quot;, his first break from Impressionism</span>
				<span class='text'>The painting received a negative response from critics and from his family, and caused another &quot;violent outburst of moral indignation&quot; from the community</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;Only his friend Christian Krohg defended him:&lt;blockquote&gt;He paints, or rather regards, things in a way that is different from that of other artists</span>
				<span class='text'>He sees only the essential, and that, naturally, is all he paints</span>
				<span class='text'>For this reason Munch's pictures are as a rule &quot;not complete&quot;, as people are so delighted to discover for themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>Oh, yes, they are complete</span>
				<span class='text'>His complete handiwork</span>
				<span class='text'>Art is complete once the artist has really said everything that was on his mind, and this is precisely the advantage Munch has over painters of the other generation, that he really knows how to show us what he has felt, and what has gripped him, and to this he subordinates everything else</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Munch continued to employ a variety of brushstroke technique and color palettes throughout the 1880s and early 1890s, as he struggled to define his style</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; His idiom continued to veer between [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalistic]], as seen in ''Portrait of Hans Jæger'', and [[Impressionism|impressionistic]], as in ''Rue Lafayette''</span>
				<span class='text'>His ''Inger On the Beach'' (1889), which caused another storm of confusion and controversy, hints at the simplified forms, heavy outlines, sharp contrasts, and emotional content of his mature style to come</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began to carefully calculate his compositions to create tension and emotion</span>
				<span class='text'>While stylistically influenced by the [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionists]], what evolved was a subject matter which was [[symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] in content, depicting a state of mind rather than an external reality</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1889, Munch presented his first one-man show of nearly all his works to date</span>
				<span class='text'>The recognition it received led to a two-year state scholarship to study in Paris under French painter [[Léon Bonnat]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Paris===Munch arrived in Paris during the festivities of the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)]] and roomed with two fellow Norwegian artists</span>
				<span class='text'>His picture, ''Morning'' (1884), was displayed at the Norwegian pavilion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his mornings at Bonnat's busy studio (which included live female models) and afternoons at the exhibition, galleries, and museums (where students were expected to make copies as a way of learning technique and observation)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munch recorded little enthusiasm for Bonnat's drawing lessons—&quot;It tires and bores me—it's numbing&quot;—but enjoyed the master's commentary during museum trips</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eg_p61&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;Munch was enthralled by the vast display of modern European art, including the works of three artists who would prove influential: [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]—all notable for how they used color to convey emotion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Eg_p61/&gt; Munch was particularly inspired by Gauguin's &quot;reaction against realism&quot; and his credo that &quot;art was human work and not an imitation of Nature&quot;, a belief earlier stated by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of his Berlin friends said later of Munch, &quot;he need not make his way to Tahiti to see and experience the primitive in human nature</span>
				<span class='text'>He carries his own Tahiti within him</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by Gauguin, as well as the etchings of German artist [[Max Klinger]], Munch experimented with prints as a medium to create graphic versions of his works</span>
				<span class='text'>He created his first woodcuts in 1896 - a medium that proved ideal to Munch's symbolic imagery</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;That December, his father died, leaving Munch's family destitute</span>
				<span class='text'>He returned home and arranged a large loan from a wealthy Norwegian collector when wealthy relatives failed to help, and assumed financial responsibility for his family from then on</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian's death depressed him and he was plagued by suicidal thoughts: &quot;I live with the dead—my mother, my sister, my grandfather, my father…Kill yourself and then it's over</span>
				<span class='text'>Why live?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munch's paintings of the following year included sketchy tavern scenes and a series of bright cityscapes in which he experimented with the [[Pointillism|pointillist]] style of [[Georges Seurat]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|pp=64–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Berlin===[[File:Edvard Munch im Lindeschen Garten, Lübeck 1902</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Edvard Munch 1902]]By 1892, Munch formulated his characteristic, and original, [[synthetism|Synthetist]] [[aesthetic]], as seen in ''Melancholy'' (1891), in which color is the symbol-laden element</span>
				<span class='text'>Considered by the artist and journalist [[Christian Krohg]] as the first [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolist]] painting by a Norwegian artist, ''Melancholy'' was exhibited in 1891 at the Autumn Exhibition in Oslo</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1892, [[Adelsteen Normann]], on behalf of the Union of Berlin Artists, invited Munch to exhibit at its November exhibition,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pr_135&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|pp=135–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; the society's first one-man exhibition</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his paintings evoked bitter controversy (dubbed &quot;The Munch Affair&quot;), and after one week the exhibition closed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pr_135&quot;/&gt; Munch was pleased with the &quot;great commotion&quot;, and wrote in a letter: &quot;Never have I had such an amusing time—it's incredible that something as innocent as painting should have created such a stir</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;In Berlin, Munch became involved in an international circle of writers, artists and critics, including the Swedish dramatist and leading intellectual [[August Strindberg]], whom he painted in 1892</span>
				<span class='text'>During his four years in Berlin, Munch sketched out most of the ideas that would comprise his major work, ''The Frieze of Life'', first designed for book illustration but later expressed in paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sold little, but made some income from charging entrance fees to view his controversial paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already, Munch was showing a reluctance to part with his paintings, which he termed his &quot;children&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>is other paintings, including casino scenes, show a simplification of form and detail which marked his early mature style</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munch also began to favor a shallow pictorial space and a minimal backdrop for his frontal figures</span>
				<span class='text'>Since poses were chosen to produce the most convincing images of states of mind and psychological conditions, as in ''Ashes'', the figures impart a monumental, static quality</span>
				<span class='text'>Munch's figures appear to play roles on a theatre stage (''Death in the Sick-Room''), whose pantomime of fixed postures signify various emotions; since each character embodies a single psychological dimension, as in ''The Scream'', Munch's men and women began to appear more symbolic than realistic</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote, &quot;No longer should interiors be painted, people reading and women knitting: there would be living people, breathing and feeling, suffering and loving</span>

				<span class='text'>'The Scream'' is Munch's most famous work, and one of the most recognizable paintings in all art</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Eg_p10/&gt; Painted with broad bands of garish color and highly simplified forms, and employing a high viewpoint, it reduces the agonized figure to a garbed skull in the throes of an emotional crisis</span>
				<span class='text'>ith this painting, Munch met his stated goal of &quot;the study of the soul, that is to say the study of my own self&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faerna|1995|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munch wrote of how the painting came to be: &quot;I was walking down the road with two friends when the sun set; suddenly, the sky turned as red as blood</span>
				<span class='text'>I stopped and leaned against the fence, feeling unspeakably tired</span>
				<span class='text'>Tongues of fire and blood stretched over the bluish black fjord</span>
				<span class='text'>My friends went on walking, while I lagged behind, shivering with fear</span>
				<span class='text'>Then I heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faerna|1995|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later described the personal anguish behind the painting, &quot;for several years I was almost mad… You know my picture, 'The Scream?' I was stretched to the limit—nature was screaming in my blood… After that I gave up hope ever of being able to love again</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;In summing up the painting's effects, author Martha Tedeschi has stated: &quot;''[[Whistler's Mother]]'', Wood's ''[[American Gothic]]'', Leonardo da Vinci's ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' and Edvard Munch's ''The Scream'' have all achieved something that most paintings—regardless of their art historical importance, beauty, or monetary value—have not: they communicate a specific meaning almost immediately to almost every viewer</span>
				<span class='text'>These few works have successfully made the transition from the elite realm of the museum visitor to the enormous venue of popular culture</span>

				<span class='text'>' &quot;Frieze of Life&quot; motifs, such as ''The Storm'' and ''Moonlight,'' are steeped in atmosphere</span>
				<span class='text'>Other motifs illuminate the nocturnal side of love, such as ''Rose and Amelie'' and ''Vampire''</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Death in the Sickroom'', the subject is the death of his sister Sophie, which he re-worked in many future variations</span>
				<span class='text'>The dramatic focus of the painting, portraying his entire family, is dispersed in the separate and disconnected figures of sorrow</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1894, he enlarged the spectrum of motifs by adding ''Anxiety'', ''Ashes'', ''[[Madonna (Edvard Munch)|Madonna]]'' and ''Women in Three Stages'' (from innocence to old age)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faerna|1995|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;Around the start of the 20th century, Munch worked to finish the &quot;Frieze&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He painted a number of pictures, several of them in larger format and to some extent featuring the [[Art Nouveau]] aesthetics of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>He made a wooden frame with carved reliefs for the large painting ''Metabolism'' (1898), initially called ''Adam and Eve''</span>
				<span class='text'>This work reveals Munch's preoccupation with the &quot;fall of man&quot; and his pessimistic philosophy of love</span>
				<span class='text'>Motifs such as ''The Empty Cross'' and ''Golgotha'' (both c</span>
				<span class='text'>1900) reflect a metaphysical orientation, and also reflect Munch's pietistic upbringing</span>
				<span class='text'>The entire ''Frieze'' was shown for the first time at the [[Berlin Secession|secessionist]] exhibition in Berlin in 1902</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;The Frieze of Life&quot; themes recur throughout Munch's work but he especially focused on them in the mid-1890s</span>
				<span class='text'>In sketches, paintings, pastels and prints, he tapped the depths of his feelings to examine his major motifs: the stages of life, the femme fatale, the hopelessness of love, anxiety, infidelity, jealousy, sexual humiliation, and separation in life and death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|pp=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; These themes are expressed in paintings such as ''[[The Sick Child]]'' (1885), ''Love and Pain'' (retitled ''[[:File:Munch vampire</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|Vampire]]''; 1893–94), ''[[:File:Munch Ashes</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|Ashes]]'' (1894), and ''The Bridge''</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter shows limp figures with featureless or hidden faces, over which loom the threatening shapes of heavy trees and brooding houses</span>
				<span class='text'>Munch portrayed women either as frail, innocent sufferers (see ''[[Puberty (Edvard Munch)|Puberty]]'' and ''Love and Pain'') or as the cause of great longing, jealousy and despair (see ''Separation'', ''Jealousy,'' and ''Ashes'')</span>
				<span class='text'>unch often uses shadows and rings of color around his figures to emphasize an aura of fear, menace, anxiety, or sexual intensity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; These paintings have been interpreted as reflections of the artist's sexual anxieties, though it could also be argued that they represent his turbulent relationship with love itself and his general pessimism regarding human existence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faerna|1995|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these sketches and paintings were done in several versions, such as ''Madonna'', ''Hands'' and ''Puberty'', and also transcribed as wood-block prints and lithographs</span>
				<span class='text'>Munch hated to part with his paintings because he thought of his work as a single body of expression</span>
				<span class='text'>So to capitalize on his production and make some income, he turned to graphic arts to reproduce many of his most famous paintings, including those in this series</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Fa_p5&gt;{{harvnb|Faerna|1995|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munch admitted to the personal goals of his work but he also offered his art to a wider purpose, &quot;My art is really a voluntary confession and an attempt to explain to myself my relationship with life—it is, therefore, actually a sort of egoism, but I am constantly hoping that through this I can help others achieve clarity</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;While attracting strongly negative reactions, in the 1890s Munch began to receive some understanding of his artistic goals, as one critic wrote, &quot;With ruthless contempt for form, clarity, elegance, wholeness, and realism, he paints with intuitive strength of talent the most subtle visions of the soul</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his great supporters in Berlin was [[Walther Rathenau]], later the German [[foreign minister]], who strongly contributed to his success</span>
				<span class='text'>==Paris, Berlin and Christiania===[[File:Edvard Munch - The sick child (1907) - Tate Modern</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|right|thumb|''[[The Sick Child]]'' (1907)]]In 1896, Munch moved to Paris, where he focused on graphic representations of his &quot;Frieze of Life&quot; themes</span>
				<span class='text'>He further developed his woodcut and lithographic technique</span>
				<span class='text'>Munch's ''Self-Portrait With Skeleton Arm'' (1895) is done with an etching needle-and-ink method also used by [[Paul Klee]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Eg_p141&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munch also produced multi-colored versions of &quot;The Sick Child&quot; which sold well, as well as several nudes and multiple versions of ''Kiss'' (1892)&lt;ref name=Eg_p141/&gt; Many of the Parisian critics still considered Munch's work &quot;violent and brutal&quot; but his exhibitions received serious attention and good attendance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; His financial situation improved considerably and in 1897, Munch bought himself a summer house facing the fjords of Christiania, a small fisherman's cabin built in the late 18th century, in the small town of [[Åsgårdstrand]] in Norway</span>
				<span class='text'>He dubbed this home the &quot;Happy House&quot; and returned here almost every summer for the next 20 years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Eg_p153/&gt; It was this place he was missing when he was abroad and in the periods then he felt depressed and exhausted</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;To walk in Åsgårdstrand is like walking among my paintings - I get so inspired to paint when I am here&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Aase and Harald Nørregaard</span>
				<span class='text'>peg|thumb|[[Harald Nørregaard]] (painted by Munch in 1899, [[National Gallery (Norway)|National Gallery]]) was one of Munch's closest friends since adolescence, adviser and lawyer&lt;ref&gt;[[Jens Thiis]], ''Edvard Munch og hans samtid</span>
				<span class='text'>Slekten, livet og kunsten, geniet'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>279, 1933&lt;/ref&gt;]]In 1897 Munch returned to Christiania, where he also received grudging acceptance—one critic wrote, &quot;A fair number of these pictures have been exhibited before</span>
				<span class='text'>In my opinion these improve on acquaintance</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Eg_p153&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, Munch began an intimate relationship with Tulla Larsen, a &quot;liberated&quot; upper-class woman</span>
				<span class='text'>They traveled to Italy together and upon returning, Munch began another fertile period in his art, which included landscapes and his final painting in &quot;The Frieze of Life&quot; series, ''The Dance of Life'' (1899)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larsen was eager for marriage, and Munch begged off</span>
				<span class='text'>His drinking and poor health reinforced his fears, as he wrote in the third person, &quot;Ever since he was a child he had hated marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>His sick and nervous home had given him the feeling that he had no right to get married</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Eg_p174&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munch almost gave in to Tulla, but fled from her in 1900, also turning away from her considerable fortune, and moved to Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Eg_p174/&gt; His ''Girls on the Jetty'', created in eighteen different versions, demonstrated the theme of feminine youth without negative connotations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Fa_p5/&gt; In 1902, he displayed his works thematically at the hall of the Berlin Secession, producing &quot;a symphonic effect—it made a great stir—a lot of antagonism—and a lot of approval</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Berlin critics were beginning to appreciate Munch's work even though the public still found his work alien and strange</span>
				<span class='text'>he good press coverage gained Munch the attention of influential patrons Albert Kollman and [[Max Linde]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He described the turn of events in his diary, &quot;After twenty years of struggle and misery forces of good finally come to my aid in Germany—and a bright door opens up for me</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite this positive change, Munch's self-destructive and erratic behavior involved him first with a violent quarrel with another artist, then with an accidental shooting in the presence of Tulla Larsen, who had returned for a brief reconciliation, which injured two of his fingers</span>
				<span class='text'>She finally left him and married a younger colleague of Munch</span>
				<span class='text'>Munch took this as a betrayal, and he dwelled on the humiliation for some time to come, channeling some of the bitterness into new paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paintings ''Still Life (The Murderess)'' and ''The Death of Marat I'', done in 1906-7, clearly reference the shooting incident and the emotional after effects</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1903-4, Munch exhibited in Paris where the coming [[Fauvism|Fauvists]], famous for their boldly false colors, likely saw his works and might have found inspiration in them</span>
				<span class='text'>When the Fauves held their own exhibit in 1906, Munch was invited and displayed his works with theirs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; After studying the sculpture of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]], Munch may have experimented with plasticine as an aid to design, but he produced little sculpture</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Munch received many commissions for portraits and prints which improved his usually precarious financial condition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|pp=196, 203}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906 he painted the screen for an Ibsen play in the Berlin [[Deutsches Theater]] small [[Kammerspiele]] Theatre, in which the [[Frieze of Life]] was hung</span>
				<span class='text'>The theatre's director [[Max Reinhardt]] later sold it; it is now in the Berlin [[Nationalgalerie]]</span>

				<span class='text'>65-78</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After an earlier period of landscapes, in 1907 he turned his attention again to human figures and situations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Breakdown and recovery===[[File:Edvard Munch 1912</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Munch in 1912]]In the autumn of 1908, Munch's anxiety, compounded by excessive drinking and brawling, had become acute</span>
				<span class='text'>As he later wrote, &quot;My condition was verging on madness—it was touch and go</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Eg_p236&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subject to hallucinations and feelings of persecution, he entered the clinic of Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Daniel Jacobson</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[psychotherapy|therapy]] Munch received for the next eight months included diet and &quot;electrification&quot; (a treatment then fashionable for nervous conditions, not to be confused with [[electroconvulsive therapy]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|pp=235–236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munch's stay in hospital stabilized his personality, and after returning to Norway in 1909, his work became more colorful and less pessimistic</span>
				<span class='text'>Further brightening his mood, the general public of Christiania finally warmed to his work, and museums began to purchase his paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>He was made a Knight of the Royal Order of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Olav &quot;for services in art&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first American exhibit was in 1912 in New York</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=373}}&lt;/ref&gt;As part of his recovery, Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Jacobson advised Munch to only socialize with good friends and avoid [[drinking in public]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Munch followed this advice and in the process produced several full-length portraits of high quality of friends and patrons—honest portrayals devoid of flattery</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also created landscapes and scenes of people at work and play, using a new optimistic style—broad, loose brushstrokes of vibrant color with frequent use of white space and rare use of black—with only occasional references to his morbid themes</span>
				<span class='text'>With more income, Munch was able to buy several properties giving him new vistas for his art and he was finally able to provide for his family</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Edvard Munch 1933</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Munch in 1933]]The outbreak of World War I found Munch with divided loyalties, as he stated, &quot;All my friends are German but it is France that I love</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, his German patrons, many Jewish, lost their fortunes and some their lives during the rise of the Nazi movement</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munch found Norwegian printers to substitute for the Germans who had been printing his graphic work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given his poor health history, during 1918 Munch felt himself lucky to have survived a bout of the [[Spanish Flu]], the worldwide pandemic of that year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Later years===Munch spent most of his last two decades in solitude at his nearly self-sufficient estate in Ekely, at [[Skøyen]], Oslo</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his late paintings celebrate farm life, including several in which he used his work horse &quot;Rousseau&quot; as a model</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without any effort, Munch attracted a steady stream of female models, whom he painted as the subjects of numerous nude paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>He likely had sexual relations with some of them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munch occasionally left his home to paint murals on commission, including those done for the [[Freia (chocolate)|Freia]] chocolate factory</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=374}}&lt;/ref&gt;To the end of his life, Munch continued to paint unsparing self-portraits, adding to his self-searching cycle of his life and his unflinching series of takes on his emotional and physical states</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1930s and 1940s, the [[Nazis]] labeled Munch's work &quot;[[degenerate art]]&quot; (along with that of [[Picasso]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Matisse]], [[Gauguin]] and many other modern artists) and removed his 82 works from German museums</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eggum|1984|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolf Hitler]] announced in 1937, &quot;For all we care, those prehistoric Stone Age culture barbarians and art-stutterers can return to the caves of their ancestors and there can apply their primitive international scratching</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prideaux|2005|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1940, the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|Germans invaded Norway]] and the Nazi party took over the government</span>
				<span class='text'>Munch was 76 years old</span>
				<span class='text'>With nearly an entire collection of his art in the second floor of his house, Munch lived in fear of a Nazi confiscation</span>
				<span class='text'>Seventy-one of the paintings previously taken by the Nazis had been returned to Norway through purchase by collectors (the other eleven were never recovered), including ''The Scream'' and ''The Sick Child'', and they too were hidden from the Nazis</span>

				<span class='text'>The episode is known as the ''Aula Controversy''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1914 Munch was finally commissioned to decorate the Aula and the work was completed in 1916</span>
				<span class='text'>This major work in Norwegian monumental painting includes 11 paintings covering 223 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Sun'', ''History'' and ''Alma Mater'' are the key works in this sequence</span>
				<span class='text'>Munch declared: “I wanted the decorations to form a complete and independent world of ideas, and I wanted their visual expression to be both distinctively Norwegian and universally human</span>
				<span class='text'> In 2014 it was suggested that the Aula paintings have a value of at least 500 million kroner</span>
