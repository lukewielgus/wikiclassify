				<span class='text'>The Iceni initially voluntarily allied with Rome following Claudius's conquest of Southern Britain AD 43</span>
				<span class='text'>They were proud of their independence, and had revolted in AD 47 when the then Roman governor [[Publius Ostorius Scapula]] planned to disarm all the peoples in the area of Britain under Roman control following a number of local uprisings</span>
				<span class='text'>Ostorius defeated them and went on to put down other uprisings around Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, The Annals, 12</span>
				<span class='text'>1-32&lt;/ref&gt; The Iceni remained independent</span>
				<span class='text'>Tacitus first mentioned Prasutagus when he wrote about Boudica‚Äôs rebellion</span>
				<span class='text'>We do not know whether he became the king after the mentioned defeat of the Iceni</span>
				<span class='text'>We do not have any record as to whether the Iceni at that point were still Roman allies or had become a client kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>acitus wrote ‚ÄúThe Icenian king Prasutagus, celebrated for his long prosperity, had named the emperor his heir, together with his two daughters; an act of deference which he thought would place his kingdom and household beyond the risk of injury</span>
				<span class='text'>The result was contrary ‚Äî so much so that his kingdom was pillaged by centurions, his household by slaves; as though they had been prizes of war</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù He added that Boudica was lashed and her two daughters were raped and that the estates of the leading Iceni men were confiscated</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, The Annals,14</span>
				<span class='text'>1&lt;/ref&gt;Cassius Dio wrote:  ‚ÄúAn excuse for the war was found in the confiscation of the sums of money that Claudius had given to the foremost Britons; for these sums, as [[Decianus Catus]], the procurator of the island maintained, were to be paid back</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù  He also said that another reasons was ‚Äúthe fact that Seneca, in the hope of receiving a good rate of interest, had lent to the islanders 40,000,000 sesterces that they did not want, and had afterwards called in this loan all at once and had resorted to severe measures in exacting it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; &lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, Roman History, 62</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;Tacitus did not say why Prasutagus‚Äô naming the emperor as his heir as well as his daughters was meant to avert the risk of injury</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not explain why the Romans pillaged the kingdom, why they took the lands of the chiefs or why Boudica was flogged and her daughters were raped</span>
				<span class='text'>Cassius Dio did not mention any of this</span>
				<span class='text'>He said that the cause of the rebellion was the decision of the procurator of Britain (the chief financial officer) and Seneca (an advisor of the emperor Nero) to call in Prasutagus‚Äô debts and the harsh measures which were taken to collect them</span>
				<span class='text'>Tacitus does not mention these events</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he wrote: ‚ÄúAlarmed by this disaster and by the fury of the province which he had goaded into war by his rapacity, the procurator Catus crossed over into Gaul</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù &lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, The Annals,14</span>
				<span class='text'>2&lt;/ref&gt;It has to be noted that this was happening while the governor of Britain, Gaius Suetonius Paulinus, was away fighting in North Wales</span>
				<span class='text'>We do not know whether he approved of these actions</span>
				<span class='text'>We do not know who the centurions who pillaged the kingdom were and who sent them</span>
				<span class='text'>The text of Cassius Dio seems to suggest that Seneca, who was a private citizen, was responsible for the violence</span>
				<span class='text'>It is unlikely that a legion was sent to land of the Iceni as two of them were fighting at the island of Anglesey and the other two were stationed at their garrisons</span>
				<span class='text'>Tacitus said that ‚ÄúIt was against the veterans that their hatred was most intense</span>
				<span class='text'>For these new settlers in the colony of Camulodunum drove people out of their houses, ejected them from their farms, called them captives and slaves ‚Ä¶‚Äù &lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, The Annals, 14</span>
				<span class='text'>1&lt;/ref&gt; This could raise the possibility that it was the retired veterans (who were no longer subject to military discipline) who might have been called on to or hired to intervene in the kingdom of the Iceni and may help to account for the extent of the violence and abuse</span>
				<span class='text'>==Boudica's uprising===In AD 60 or 61, while the current governor, [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], was leading a campaign against the island of {{lang|la|Mona}} (modern [[Anglesey]]) in the north of Wales, which was a refuge for British rebels and a stronghold of the [[druid]]s, the Iceni conspired with their neighbours the Trinovantes, amongst others, to revolt</span>
				<span class='text'>Boudica was chosen as their leader</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Tacitus, they drew inspiration from the example of [[Arminius]], the prince of the [[Cherusci]] who had driven the Romans out of Germany in AD 9, and their own ancestors who had driven [[Julius Caesar]] from Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''{{lang|la|Agricola}}'' [[Wikisource:Agricola#15|15]]&lt;/ref&gt; Dio says that at the outset Boudica employed a form of [[divination]], releasing a [[hare]] from the folds of her dress and interpreting the direction in which it ran, and invoked [[Andraste]], a British [[goddess]] of [[Victoria (mythology)|victory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he rebels' first target was {{lang|la|[[Camulodunum#Iceni Revolt|Camulodunum]]}} ([[Colchester]]), the former Trinovantian capital and, at that time, a Roman ''{{lang|la|[[colonia (Roman)|colonia]]}}''</span>
				<span class='text'>The Roman veterans who had been settled there mistreated the locals and a temple to the former emperor [[Claudius]] had been erected there at local expense, making the city a focus for resentment</span>
				<span class='text'>The Roman inhabitants sought reinforcements from the procurator, Catus Decianus, but he sent only two hundred [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary troops]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Boudica's army fell on the poorly defended city and destroyed it, besieging the last defenders in the temple for two days before it fell</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] have shown that the city was methodically demolished</span>

				<span class='text'>uetonius took a stand at an unidentified location, probably in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] somewhere along the [[Roman road]] now known as [[Watling Street]], in a [[defile (geography)|defile]] with a wood behind him&amp;nbsp;‚Äî but his men were heavily outnumbered</span>
				<span class='text'>Dio says that, even if they were lined up one deep, they would not have extended the length of Boudica's line</span>
				<span class='text'>By now the rebel forces were said to have numbered 230,000, however, this number should be treated with scepticism&amp;nbsp;‚Äî Dio's account is known only from a late [[epitome]], and ancient sources commonly exaggerate enemy numbers</span>
				<span class='text'>oudica exhorted her troops from her [[chariot]], her daughters beside her</span>
				<span class='text'>Tacitus gives her a short speech in which she presents herself not as an [[aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] avenging her lost wealth, but as an ordinary person, avenging her lost freedom, her battered body, and the abused chastity of her daughters</span>
				<span class='text'>She said their cause was just, and the deities were on their side; the one legion that had dared to face them had been destroyed</span>
				<span class='text'>She, a woman, was resolved to win or die; if the men wanted to live in slavery, that was their choice</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, the lack of manoeuvrability of the British forces, combined with lack of open-field tactics to command these numbers, put them at a disadvantage to the Romans, who were skilled at open combat due to their superior equipment and discipline</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, the narrowness of the field meant that Boudica could put forth only as many troops as the Romans could at a given time</span>
				<span class='text'>irst, the Romans stood their ground and used volleys of ''{{lang|la|[[pilum|pila]]}}'' (heavy javelins) to kill thousands of Britons who were rushing toward the Roman lines</span>
				<span class='text'>The Roman soldiers, who had now used up their ''{{lang|la|pila}}'', were then able to engage Boudica's second wave in the open</span>
				<span class='text'>As the Romans advanced in a [[flying wedge|wedge]] formation, the Britons attempted to flee, but were impeded by the presence of their own families, whom they had stationed in a ring of wagons at the edge of the battlefield, and were slaughtered</span>
				<span class='text'>This is not the first instance of this tactic ‚Äî the women of the [[Cimbri]], in the [[Battle of Vercellae]] against [[Gaius Marius]], were stationed in a line of wagons and acted as a last line of defence</span>

				<span class='text'>Considering Dio must have read Tacitus, it is worth noting he mentions nothing about suicide (which was also how Postumus and Nero ended their lives)</span>

				<span class='text'>Cassius Dio's account is only known from an [[epitome]], and his sources are uncertain</span>
				<span class='text'>He is generally agreed to have based his account on that of Tacitus, but he simplifies the sequence of events and adds details, such as the calling in of loans, that Tacitus does not mention</span>
				<span class='text'>[Gildas]], in his 6th century ''{{lang|la|[[De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae]]}}'', may have been alluding to Boudica when he wrote &quot;A treacherous lioness butchered the governors who had been left to give fuller voice and strength to the endeavours of Roman rule&quot;</span>
