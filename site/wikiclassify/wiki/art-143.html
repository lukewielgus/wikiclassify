				<span class='text'>His economical and [[Iceberg Theory|understated]] style had a strong influence on [[20th century in literature|20th-century fiction]], while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations</span>
				<span class='text'>Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1954</span>
				<span class='text'>He published seven novels, six short story collections, and two non-fiction works</span>
				<span class='text'>Additional works, including three novels, four short story collections, and three non-fiction works, were published posthumously</span>

				<span class='text'>After high school he reported for a few months for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'', before leaving for the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian front]] to enlist with the [[List of ambulance drivers during World War I|World War&amp;nbsp;I ambulance drivers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1918, he was seriously wounded and returned home</span>
				<span class='text'>His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1929)</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1921, he married [[Hadley Richardson]], the first of his four wives</span>
				<span class='text'>The couple moved to Paris, where he worked as a [[Correspondent|foreign correspondent]] and fell under the influence of the [[modernism|modernist]] writers and artists of the 1920s &quot;[[Lost Generation]]&quot; expatriate community</span>
				<span class='text'>He published his [[debut novel|first novel]], ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'', in 1926</span>
				<span class='text'>After his 1927 divorce from Hadley Richardson, Hemingway married [[Pauline Pfeiffer]]; they divorced after he returned from the [[Spanish Civil War]] where he had been a journalist, and after which he wrote ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1940)</span>

				<span class='text'>Hemingway and Marcelline both had pieces submitted to ''The Trapeze''; Hemingway's first piece, published in January&amp;nbsp;1916, was about a local performance by the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]]</span>

				<span class='text'>in Oliver (1999), 322&lt;/ref&gt;|}[[Henry Louis Gates]] believes Hemingway's style was fundamentally shaped &quot;in reaction to [his] experience of world war&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>After World War&amp;nbsp;I, he and other modernists &quot;lost faith in the central institutions of Western civilization&quot; by reacting against the elaborate style of 19th century writers and by creating a style &quot;in which meaning is established through dialogue, through action, and silencesâ€”a fiction in which nothing crucialâ€”or at least very littleâ€”is stated explicitly</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Putnam&quot;/&gt;Developing this connection between Hemingway and other modernist writers, [[Irene Gammel]] believes his style was carefully cultivated and honed with an eye toward the avant-garde of the era</span>
				<span class='text'>Hungry for &quot;vanguard experimentation&quot; and rebelling against Ford Madox Ford's &quot;staid modernism&quot;, Hemingway published the work of Gertrude Stein and Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven in ''The Transatlantic Review''</span>
				<span class='text'>As Gammel notes, Hemingway was &quot;introduced to the Baroness's experimental style during a time when he was actively trimming the verbal 'fat' off his own style, as well as flexing his writer's muscles in assaulting conventional taste</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gammel (2002), 363â€“64&lt;/ref&gt;Because he began as a writer of short stories, Baker believes Hemingway learned to &quot;get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker p117&quot;&gt;Baker (1972),  117&lt;/ref&gt; Hemingway called his style the [[Iceberg Theory]]: the facts float above water; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Baker p117&quot;/&gt; The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the &quot;theory of omission&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in &quot;The Big Two-Hearted River&quot;) though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about anything else)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Oliver (1999), 321â€“322&lt;/ref&gt;Jackson Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices about life in generalâ€”not only about his life</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with &quot;what if&quot; scenarios: &quot;what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Benson (1989), 351&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing in &quot;The Art of the Short Story&quot;, Hemingway explains: &quot;A few things I have found to be true</span>
				<span class='text'>If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened</span>
				<span class='text'>If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless</span>
				<span class='text'>The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit</span>

				<span class='text'>Zoe Trodd believes Hemingway crafted skeletal sentences in response to [[Henry James]]'s observation that World War&amp;nbsp;I had &quot;used up words&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Hemingway offers a &quot;multi-focal&quot; photographic reality</span>
				<span class='text'>His iceberg theory of omission is the foundation on which he builds</span>
				<span class='text'>The syntax, which lacks [[grammatical conjunction|subordinating conjunctions]], creates static sentences</span>
				<span class='text'>The photographic &quot;[[Snapshot (photography)|snapshot]]&quot; style creates a [[collage]] of images</span>
				<span class='text'>Many types of internal punctuation (colons, semicolons, dashes, parentheses) are omitted in favor of short declarative sentences</span>
				<span class='text'>The sentences build on each other, as events build to create a sense of the whole</span>
				<span class='text'>Multiple strands exist in one story; an &quot;embedded text&quot; bridges to a different angle</span>
				<span class='text'>He also uses other cinematic techniques of &quot;cutting&quot; quickly from one scene to the next; or of &quot;splicing&quot; a scene into another</span>
				<span class='text'>Intentional omissions allow the reader to fill the gap, as though responding to instructions from the author, and create three-dimensional prose</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Trodd (2007), 8&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Hemingway habitually used the word &quot;and&quot; in place of commas</span>
				<span class='text'>This use of [[polysyndeton]] may serve to convey immediacy</span>

Strangle them</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;qtd</span>
				<span class='text'>in Hoberek (2005), 309&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hemingway's intent was not to eliminate emotion, but to portray it more scientifically</span>
				<span class='text'>Hemingway thought it would be easy, and pointless, to describe emotions; he sculpted collages of images in order to grasp &quot;the real thing, the sequence of motion and fact which made the emotion and which would be as valid in a year or in ten years or, with luck and if you stated it purely enough, always&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McCormick, 47&lt;/ref&gt; Hemingway's letters refer to Proust's ''[[In Search of Lost Time|Remembrance of Things Past]]'' several times over the years, and indicate he read the book at least twice</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Burwell p187&quot;&gt;Burwell (1996), 187&lt;/ref&gt;== Themes ==The popularity of Hemingway's work to a great extent is based on the themes, which according to scholar Frederic Svoboda are love, war, wilderness and loss, all of which are strongly evident in the body of work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Svoboda (2000), 155&lt;/ref&gt; These are recurring themes of [[American literature]], which are clearly evident in Hemingway's work</span>
				<span class='text'>Critic [[Leslie Fiedler]] sees the theme he defines as &quot;The Sacred Land&quot;â€”the [[American Old West|American West]]â€”extended in Hemingway's work to include mountains in Spain, Switzerland and Africa, and to the streams of Michigan</span>
				<span class='text'>The American West is given a symbolic nod with the naming of the &quot;Hotel Montana&quot; in ''The Sun Also Rises'' and ''For Whom the Bell Tolls''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Fiedler&quot;/&gt;  According to Stoltzfus and Fiedler, Hemingway's nature is a place for rebirth, for therapy, and the hunter or fisherman has a moment of transcendence when the prey is killed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Stoltzfus&quot;/&gt; Nature is where men are without women: men fish; men hunt; men find redemption in nature</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Fiedler&quot;/&gt; Although Hemingway writes about sports, Carlos Baker believes the emphasis is more on the athlete than the sport,&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker1972 101â€“121&quot;&gt;Baker (1972), 101â€“121&lt;/ref&gt; while Beegel sees the essence of Hemingway as an American [[naturalist]], as reflected in such detailed descriptions as can be found in &quot;Big Two-Hearted River&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Beegel2000, p</span>
				<span class='text'>63-70&quot;/&gt;Fiedler believes Hemingway inverts the American literary theme of the evil &quot;Dark Woman&quot; versus the good &quot;Light Woman&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The dark womanâ€”Brett Ashley of ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]''â€”is a goddess; the light womanâ€”Margot Macomber of &quot;[[The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber]]&quot;â€”is a murderess</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Fiedler&quot;&gt;Fiedler (1975), 345â€“365&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Scholes]] admits that early Hemingway stories, such as &quot;[[A Very Short Story]]&quot;, present &quot;a male character favorably and a female unfavorably&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Scholes (1990),  42&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Rena Sanderson, early Hemingway critics lauded his male-centric world of masculine pursuits, and the fiction divided women into &quot;castrators or love-slaves&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Feminist critics attacked Hemingway as &quot;public enemy number one&quot;, although more recent re-evaluations of his work &quot;have given new visibility to Hemingway's female characters (and their strengths) and have revealed his own sensitivity to gender issues, thus casting doubts on the old assumption that his writings were one-sidedly masculine</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson (1996), 171&lt;/ref&gt; Nina Baym believes that Brett Ashley and Margot Macomber &quot;are the two outstanding examples of Hemingway's 'bitch women</span>

				<span class='text'>New York: Scribner's&lt;/ref&gt;|}The theme of women and death is evident in stories as early as &quot;[[Indian Camp]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The theme of death permeates Hemingway's work</span>
				<span class='text'>Young believes the emphasis in &quot;Indian Camp&quot; was not so much on the woman who gives birth or the father who commits suicide, but on Nick Adams who witnesses these events as a child, and becomes a &quot;badly scarred and nervous young man&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Hemingway sets the events in &quot;Indian Camp&quot; that shape the Adams persona</span>
				<span class='text'>Young believes &quot;Indian Camp&quot; holds the &quot;master key&quot; to &quot;what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Young (1964), 6&lt;/ref&gt; Stoltzfus considers Hemingway's work to be more complex with a representation of the truth inherent in [[existentialism]]: if &quot;nothingness&quot; is embraced, then redemption is achieved at the moment of death</span>
				<span class='text'>Those who face death with dignity and courage live an authentic life</span>
				<span class='text'>Francis Macomber dies happy because the last hours of his life are authentic; the [[bullfighter]] in the [[Bullfighting|corrida]] represents the pinnacle of a life lived with authenticity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Stoltzfus&quot;&gt;Stoltzfus (2005), 215â€“218&lt;/ref&gt; In his paper ''The Uses of Authenticity: Hemingway and the Literary Field'', Timo MÃ¼ller writes that Hemingway's fiction is successful because the characters live an &quot;authentic life&quot;, and the &quot;soldiers, fishers, boxers and backwoodsmen are among the archetypes of authenticity in modern literature&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;MÃ¼ller (2010), 31&lt;/ref&gt;The theme of emasculation is prevalent in Hemingway's work, most notably in ''The Sun Also Rises''</span>
				<span class='text'>Emasculation, according to Fiedler, is a result of a generation of wounded soldiers; and of a generation in which women such as Brett gained [[Women's suffrage|emancipation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This also applies to the minor character, Frances Clyne, Cohn's girlfriend in the beginning in the book</span>
				<span class='text'>Her character supports the theme not only because the idea was presented early on in the novel but also the impact she had on Cohn in the start of the book while only appearing a small number of times</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Fiedler&quot;/&gt; Baker believes Hemingway's work emphasizes the &quot;natural&quot; versus the &quot;unnatural&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In &quot;Alpine Idyll&quot; the &quot;unnaturalness&quot; of skiing in the high country late spring snow is juxtaposed against the &quot;unnaturalness&quot; of the peasant who allowed his wife's dead body to linger too long in the shed during the winter</span>
				<span class='text'>The skiers and peasant retreat to the valley to the &quot;natural&quot; spring for redemption</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Baker1972 101â€“121&quot;/&gt;Susan Beegel has written that some more recent criticsâ€”writing through the lens of a more modern social and cultural context several decades after Hemingway's death, and more than half a century after his novels were first publishedâ€”have characterized the social era portrayed in his fiction as [[misogynistic]] and [[homophobic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Beegel 1996 282&quot;&gt;Beegel (1996), 282&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1996 essay, &quot;Critical Reception&quot;, Beegel analyzed four decades of Hemingway criticism and found that &quot;critics interested in multiculturalism&quot;, particularly in the 1980s, simply ignored Hemingway, although some &quot;apologetics&quot; have been written</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Beegel (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Typical, according to Beegel, is an analysis of Hemingway's 1926 novel, ''The Sun Also Rises'', in which a critic contended: &quot;Hemingway never lets the reader forget that Cohn is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a Jew</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Also during the 1980s, according to Beegel, criticism was published that focused on investigating the &quot;horror of [[homosexuality]]&quot; and the &quot;[[racism]]&quot; typical of the social era portrayed in Hemingway's fiction</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Beegel 1996 282&quot;/&gt; In an overall assessment of Hemingway's work Beegel has written: &quot;Throughout his remarkable body of fiction, he tells the truth about human fear, guilt, betrayal, violence, cruelty, drunkenness, hunger, greed, apathy, ecstasy, tenderness, love and lust</span>
