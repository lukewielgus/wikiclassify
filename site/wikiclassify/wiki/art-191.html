				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC Francis&quot;/&gt; In 1205, Francis left for [[Apulia]] to enlist in the army of [[Walter III, Count of Brienne]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ODCC Francis&quot;/&gt; Francis returned home, began preaching on the streets, and soon gathered followers</span>
				<span class='text'>His Order was authorized by [[Pope Innocent&amp;nbsp;III]] in 1210</span>
				<span class='text'>He then founded the Order of Poor Clares, which became an [[enclosed religious order]] for women, as well as the Order of Brothers and Sisters of Penance (commonly called the Third Order)</span>
				<span class='text'>As a youth, Francesco became a devotee of [[troubadours]] and was fascinated with all things [[Transalpine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;cefa&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chesterton&quot;/&gt; Although many [[Hagiography|hagiographers]] remark about his bright clothing, rich friends, and love of pleasures,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lives&quot;/&gt; his displays of disillusionment toward the world that surrounded him came fairly early in his life, as is shown in the &quot;story of the beggar</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In this account, he was selling cloth and velvet in the marketplace on behalf of his father when a beggar came to him and asked for [[alms]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the conclusion of his business deal, Francis abandoned his wares and ran after the beggar</span>
				<span class='text'>When he found him, Francis gave the man everything he had in his pockets</span>
				<span class='text'>His friends quickly chided and mocked him for his act of charity</span>
				<span class='text'>When he got home, his father scolded him in rage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;chest41&quot;&gt;Chesterton (1924), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;40‚Äì41&lt;/ref&gt;According to the [[Hagiography|hagiographic]] legend, thereafter he began to avoid the sports and the feasts of his former companions</span>
				<span class='text'>In response, they asked him laughingly whether he was thinking of marrying, to which he answered, &quot;Yes, a fairer bride than any of you have ever seen,&quot; meaning his &quot;Lady Poverty&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent much time in lonely places, asking God for [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|spiritual enlightenment]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By degrees he took to nursing [[leper]]s, the most repulsive victims in the [[lazar house]]s near [[Assisi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After a [[pilgrim]]age to Rome, where he joined the poor in begging at the doors of the churches, he said he had a mystical [[visions of Jesus and Mary|vision of Jesus Christ]] in the country chapel of [[San Damiano, Assisi|San Damiano]], just outside Assisi, in which the [[San Damiano cross|Icon of Christ Crucified]] said to him, &quot;Francis, Francis, go and repair My house which, as you can see, is falling into ruins</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He took this to mean the ruined church in which he was presently praying, and so he sold some cloth from his father's store to assist the priest there for this purpose</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;cefa&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chest54&quot;&gt;Chesterton (1924), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;54‚Äì56&lt;/ref&gt;His father, Pietro, highly indignant, attempted to change his mind, first with threats and then with beatings</span>
				<span class='text'>In the midst of legal proceedings before the [[Bishop of Assisi]], Francis renounced his father and his [[Property|patrimony]], laying aside even the garments he had received from him in front of the public</span>
				<span class='text'>For the next couple of months he lived as a beggar in the region of Assisi</span>
				<span class='text'>Returning to the countryside around the town for two years, he embraced the life of a [[penitent]], during which he restored several ruined chapels in the countryside around Assisi, among them the [[Porziuncola]], the little chapel of [[Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary of the Angels]] just outside the town, which later became his favorite [[Dwelling|abode]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;chest54&quot;/&gt;==Founding of the Franciscan Orders=====The Friars minor===At the end of this period (on February 24, 1209, according to Jordan of Giano), Francis heard a [[sermon]] that changed his life forever</span>
				<span class='text'>The sermon was about [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 10:9, in which Christ tells his followers they should go forth and proclaim that the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]] was upon them, that they should take no money with them, nor even a walking stick or shoes for the road</span>
				<span class='text'>Francis was inspired to devote himself to a life of poverty</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;cefa&quot;/&gt;Clad in a rough garment, barefoot, and, after the Gospel precept, without staff or [[scrip]], he began to preach repentance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;cefa&quot;/&gt; He was soon joined by his first follower, a prominent fellow townsman, the [[jurist]] [[Bernardo di Quintavalle]], who contributed all that he had to the work</span>
				<span class='text'>Within a year Francis had eleven followers</span>
				<span class='text'>Francis chose never to be ordained a priest, and the community lived as &quot;lesser brothers,&quot; ''fratres minores'' in Latin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;cefa&quot;/&gt; The brothers lived a [[simple living|simple life]] in the deserted [[lazar house]] of Rivo Torto near Assisi; but they spent much of their time wandering through the mountainous districts of [[Umbria]], always cheerful and full of songs, yet making a deep impression upon their hearers by their earnest exhortations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;cefa&quot;/&gt;Francis' preaching to ordinary people was unusual since he had no license to do so</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;EBO Francis&quot;/&gt; In 1209 he composed a simple rule for his followers (&quot;friars&quot;), the ''Regula primitiva'' or &quot;Primitive Rule&quot;, which came from verses in the Bible</span>
				<span class='text'>he rule was &quot;To follow the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ and to walk in his footsteps</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In 1209, Francis led his first eleven followers to Rome to seek permission from [[Pope Innocent III]] to found a new religious Order</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;chest107&quot;&gt;Chesterton (1924), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;107‚Äì108&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entry to Rome, the brothers encountered Bishop Guido of Assisi, who had in his company [[Giovanni di San Paolo]], the [[Cardinal Bishop of Sabina]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Cardinal, who was the confessor of Pope Innocent&amp;nbsp;III, was immediately sympathetic to Francis and agreed to represent Francis to the pope</span>
				<span class='text'>Reluctantly, Pope Innocent agreed to meet with Francis and the brothers the next day</span>
				<span class='text'>After several days, the pope agreed to admit the group informally, adding that when God increased the group in grace and number, they could return for an official admittance</span>
				<span class='text'>The group was [[tonsure]]d</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Francis of Assisi and His World&quot;&gt;Galli(2002), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;74‚Äì80&lt;/ref&gt; This was important in part because it recognized Church authority and prevented his following from possible accusations of heresy, as had happened to the [[Waldensians]] decades earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Pope Innocent initially had his doubts, following a dream in which he saw Francis holding up the [[Basilica of St</span>
				<span class='text'>John Lateran]] (the cathedral of Rome, thus the 'home church' of all Christendom), he decided to endorse Francis' Order</span>
				<span class='text'>This occurred, according to tradition, on April 16, 1210, and constituted the official founding of the [[Franciscan Order]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;EBO Francis&quot;/&gt; The group, then the &quot;Lesser Brothers&quot; (''Order of Friars Minor'' also known as the ''Franciscan Order''), preached on the streets and had no possessions</span>
				<span class='text'>They were centered in the Porziuncola and preached first in Umbria, before expanding throughout Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;EBO Francis&quot;/&gt;===The Poor Clares and the Third Order===From then on, the new Order grew quickly with new vocations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;chest110&quot;&gt;Chesterton (1924), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;110‚Äì111&lt;/ref&gt; Hearing Francis preaching in the church of [[Assisi Cathedral|San Rufino]] in Assisi in 1211, the young noblewoman [[Clare of Assisi]] became deeply touched by his message and realized her calling</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;chest110&quot;/&gt; Her cousin Rufino, the only male member of the family in their generation, was also attracted to the new Order (which he joined)</span>
				<span class='text'>On the night of [[Palm Sunday]], March 28, 1212, Clare clandestinely left her family's palace</span>
				<span class='text'>Francis received her at the Porziuncola and thereby established the Order of Poor Ladies, later called [[Poor Clares]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;chest110&quot;/&gt; This was an Order for women, and he gave Clare a [[religious habit]], or garment, similar to his own, before lodging her and a few female companions in a nearby monastery of [[Order of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Benedict|Benedictine]] nuns</span>
				<span class='text'>Later he transferred them to San Damiano</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;EBO Francis&quot;/&gt; There they were joined by many other women of Assisi</span>
				<span class='text'>For those who could not leave their homes, he later formed the Third Order of Brothers and Sisters of Penance, a fraternity composed of either [[laity]] or clergy whose members neither withdrew from the world nor took [[religious vows]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, they observed the principles of Franciscan life in their daily lives</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;EBO Francis&quot;/&gt; Before long, this Third Order grew beyond Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>=Travels==Determined to bring the Gospel to all God's creatures, Francis sought on several occasions to take his message out of Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>In the late spring of 1212, he set out for Jerusalem, but he was shipwrecked by a storm on the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, forcing him to return to Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>On May 8, 1213, he was given the use of the mountain of [[La Verna]] (Alverna) as a gift from [[Count]] Orlando di Chiusi, who described it as ‚Äúeminently suitable for whoever wishes to do penance in a place remote from mankind</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;chest130&quot;/&gt;In the same year, Francis sailed for Morocco, but this time an illness forced him to break off his journey in Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>Back in Assisi, several noblemen (among them [[Tommaso da Celano]], who would later write the biography of St</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1215, Francis went again to Rome for the [[Fourth Lateran Council]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1217, he offered to go to France</span>
				<span class='text'>Cardinal Ugolino of Segni (the future Pope Gregory IX), an early and important supporter of Francis, advised him against this and said that he was still needed in Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1219, accompanied by another friar and hoping to convert the Sultan of Egypt or win martyrdom in the attempt, Francis went to Egypt during the [[Fifth Crusade]] where a Crusader army had been encamped for over a year besieging the walled city of [[Damietta]] two miles ({{convert|2|mi|abbr=out|1|disp=output only}}) upstream from the mouth of one of the main channels of the Nile</span>
				<span class='text'>The Sultan, [[al-Kamil]], a nephew of [[Saladin]], had succeeded his father as Sultan of Egypt in 1218 and was encamped upstream of Damietta, unable to relieve it</span>
				<span class='text'>A bloody and futile attack on the city was launched by the Christians on August 29, 1219, following which both sides agreed to a ceasefire which lasted four weeks</span>

				<span class='text'>Upon receiving a report of the martyrdom of five brothers in [[Morocco]], Francis returned to Italy via [[Venice]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;b162&quot;&gt;Bonaventure (1867), p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;162&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal [[Pope Gregory IX|Ugolino di Conti]] was then nominated by the Pope as the protector of the Order</span>
				<span class='text'>Another reason for Francis' return to Italy was that the friars in Italy were causing problems</span>
				<span class='text'>The Franciscan Order had grown at an unprecedented rate compared to prior religious orders, but its organizational sophistication had not kept up with this growth and had little more to govern it than Francis' example and simple rule</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;EBO Francis&quot;/&gt; To address this problem, Francis prepared a new and more detailed Rule, the &quot;First Rule&quot; or &quot;Rule Without a [[Papal Bull]]&quot; (''Regula prima'', ''Regula non bullata''), which again asserted devotion to poverty and the apostolic life</span>
				<span class='text'>However, it also introduced greater institutional structure though this was never officially endorsed by the pope</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;EBO Francis&quot;/&gt;On September 29, 1220, Francis handed over the governance of the Order to Brother Peter Catani at the Porziuncola, but Brother Peter died only five months later, on March 10, 1221, and was buried there</span>
				<span class='text'>When numerous miracles were attributed to the deceased brother, people started to flock to the Porziuncola, disturbing the daily life of the Franciscans</span>
				<span class='text'>Francis then prayed, asking Peter to stop the miracles and to obey in death as he had obeyed during his life</span>
				<span class='text'>he reports of miracles ceased</span>
				<span class='text'>Brother Peter was succeeded by Brother Elias as [[Vicar]] of Francis</span>
				<span class='text'>Two years later, Francis modified the &quot;First Rule&quot;, creating the &quot;Second Rule&quot; or &quot;Rule With a Bull&quot;, which was approved by Pope Honorius III on November 29, 1223</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;EBO Francis&quot;/&gt; As the official Rule of the Order, it called on the friars &quot;to observe the Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, living in obedience without anything of our own and in chastity&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, it set regulations for discipline, preaching, and entry into the Order</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;EBO Francis&quot;/&gt; Once the Rule was endorsed by the Pope, Francis withdrew increasingly from external affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;EBO Francis&quot;/&gt; During 1221 and 1222, Francis crossed Italy, first as far south as [[Catania]] in Sicily and afterwards as far north as [[Bologna]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hile he was praying on the mountain of Verna, during a forty-day fast in preparation for [[Michaelmas]] (September 29), Francis is said to have had a vision on or about September 14, 1224, the Feast of the [[Exaltation of the Cross]], as a result of which he received the [[stigmata]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;chest131&quot;/&gt; Brother Leo, who had been with Francis at the time, left a clear and simple account of the event, the first definite account of the phenomenon of stigmata</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;cefa&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chest131&quot;/&gt; &quot;Suddenly he saw a vision of a seraph, a six-winged angel on a cross</span>
				<span class='text'>This angel gave him the gift of the five wounds of Christ</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;chest131&quot;&gt;Chesterton (1924), p</span>
				<span class='text'>31&lt;/ref&gt; Suffering from these stigmata and from [[trachoma]], Francis received care in several cities ([[Siena]], [[Cortona]], [[Nocera Umbra|Nocera]]) to no avail</span>
				<span class='text'>In the end, he was brought back to a hut next to the Porziuncola</span>
				<span class='text'>Here, in the place where it all began, feeling the end approaching, he spent the last days of his life dictating his spiritual Testament</span>
				<span class='text'>He died on the evening of Saturday, October 3, 1226, singing Psalm 142 (141), ''&quot;Voce mea ad Dominum&quot;''</span>

				<span class='text'>Francis say that he had a great love for animals and the environment</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;b78&quot;&gt;Bonaventure (1867), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;78‚Äì85&lt;/ref&gt;Perhaps the most famous incident that illustrates the Saint's humility towards nature is recounted in the &quot;Fioretti&quot; (&quot;Little Flowers&quot;), a collection of [[legend]]s and folklore that sprang up after the Saint's death</span>
				<span class='text'>It is said that, one day, while Francis was travelling with some companions, they happened upon a place in the road where birds filled the trees on either side</span>
				<span class='text'>Francis told his companions to &quot;wait for me while I go to preach to my sisters the birds</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;b78&quot;/&gt; The birds surrounded him, intrigued by the power of his voice, and not one of them flew away</span>
				<span class='text'>He is often portrayed with a bird, typically in his hand</span>
				<span class='text'>nother legend from the ''[[Fioretti]]'' tells that in the city of [[Gubbio]], where Francis lived for some time, was a [[Wolf of Gubbio|wolf &quot;terrifying and ferocious, who devoured men as well as animals</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;]] Francis had compassion upon the townsfolk, and so he went up into the hills to find the wolf</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon, fear of the animal had caused all his companions to flee, though the saint pressed on</span>
				<span class='text'>When he found the wolf, he made the sign of the cross and commanded the wolf to come to him and hurt no one</span>
				<span class='text'>Miraculously the wolf closed his jaws and lay down at the feet of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Francis</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Brother Wolf, you do much harm in these parts and you have done great evil,&quot; said Francis</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;All these people accuse you and curse you</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ut brother wolf, I would like to make peace between you and the people</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Then Francis led the wolf into the town, and surrounded by startled citizens made a pact between them and the wolf</span>
				<span class='text'>Because the wolf had ‚Äúdone evil out of hunger, the townsfolk were to feed the wolf regularly</span>
				<span class='text'>In return, the wolf would no longer prey upon them or their flocks</span>
				<span class='text'>In this manner [[Gubbio]] was freed from the menace of the predator</span>
				<span class='text'>Francis even made a pact on behalf of the town dogs, that they would not bother the wolf again</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, to show the townspeople that they would not be harmed, Francis blessed the wolf</span>
				<span class='text'>hen during the World Environment Day 1982, John Paul II said that St</span>
				<span class='text'>Francis' love and care for creation was a challenge for contemporary Catholics and a reminder &quot;not to behave like dissident predators where nature is concerned, but to assume responsibility for it, taking all care so that everything stays healthy and integrated, so as to offer a welcoming and friendly environment even to those who succeed us</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The same Pope wrote on the occasion of the World Day of Peace, January 1, 1990, the saint of Assisi &quot;offers Christians an example of genuine and deep respect for the integrity of creation</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He went on to make the point that: &quot;As a friend of the poor who was loved by God's creatures, Saint Francis invited all of creation ‚Äì animals, plants, natural forces, even Brother Sun and Sister Moon ‚Äì to give honor and praise to the Lord</span>
				<span class='text'>The poor man of Assisi gives us striking witness that when we are at peace with God we are better able to devote ourselves to building up that peace with all creation which is inseparable from peace among all peoples</span>
