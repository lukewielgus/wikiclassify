				<span class='text'>tml|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;During the war, Lawrence fought alongside Arab [[irregular military|irregular troops]] under the command of [[Faisal I of Iraq|Emir Faisal]], a son of [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Sharif Hussein]] of [[Mecca]], in extended [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] operations against the armed forces of the Ottoman Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Lawrence obtained assistance from the [[Royal Navy]] to turn back an Ottoman attack on [[Yanbu]] in December 1916</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Parnell&quot;/&gt; Lawrence's major contribution to the revolt was convincing the Arab leaders (Faisal and [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]]) to co-ordinate their actions in support of British strategy</span>
				<span class='text'>He persuaded the Arabs not to make a frontal assault on the Ottoman stronghold in [[Medina]] but to allow the Turkish army to tie up troops in the city garrison</span>
				<span class='text'>The Arabs were then free to direct most of their attention to the Turks' weak point, the [[Hejaz railway]] that supplied the garrison</span>
				<span class='text'>This vastly expanded the battlefield and tied up even more Ottoman troops, who were then forced to protect the railway and repair the constant damage</span>
				<span class='text'>Lawrence developed a close relationship with Faisal, whose Arab Northern Army became the main beneficiary of British aid</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On January 3, 1917, Lawrence went off on his first desert raid with 35 armed tribesmen</span>
				<span class='text'>Under cover of darkness, they rode their camels out of camp, dismounted, and scrambled up a steep hill overlooking a Turkish encampment, which they peppered with rifle fire until driven off</span>
				<span class='text'>Returning, they came across two Turks relieving themselves, and took them back to camp for questioning</span>
				<span class='text'>That minor triumph was later counterbalanced by a small tragedy when Lawrence had to personally execute a member of his own band to prevent a crippling blood feud from breaking out, a deed that haunted him for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Parnell&quot;/&gt; At the end of March, Lawrence set off on his first raid against the railway, a Turkish station at Abu el-Naam</span>
				<span class='text'>After carefully reconnoitering it, Lawrence crept down to the lines at nightfall and laid a Garland mine under the tracks, cutting the telegraph wires as he left</span>
				<span class='text'>The next morning, the Bedouins overran the station with the aid of a mountain gun and a howitzer, setting several wagons of a nearby train on fire</span>
				<span class='text'>As it steamed out of the station, Lawrence blew the mine under the front bogies, knocking it off the rails</span>
				<span class='text'>The Turks got the train rolling again, but the operation was a success</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; The attacks on the railway continued throughout 1917</span>
				<span class='text'>During one, Lawrence blew up a locomotive with an electric mine</span>
				<span class='text'>â€˜We had a Lewis [machine gun],â€™ he wrote in a letter to a friend, â€˜and flung bullets through the sides</span>
				<span class='text'>So they hopped out and took cover behind the embankment, and shot at us between the wheels at 50 yards</span>
				<span class='text'>€™ The Arabs brought up a Stokes mortar, and the Turks fled across open ground</span>
				<span class='text'>â€˜Unfortunately for them,â€™ Lawrence continued, â€˜the Lewis covered the open stretch</span>
				<span class='text'>The whole job took ten minutes, and they lost 70 killed, 30 wounded and 80 prisoners,â€™ for the loss of only one Arab</span>
				<span class='text'>While the Arabs looted the train, another Turkish force arrived, nearly cutting off the Bedouins</span>
				<span class='text'>â€˜I lost some baggage, and nearly myself,â€™ Lawrence added nonchalantly</span>
				<span class='text'>In another letter about that same &quot;show,&quot; Lawrence confided, â€˜Iâ€™m not going to last out this game much longer: nerves going and temper wearing thinâ€¦</span>

				<span class='text'>Faisal's rule as king, however, came to an abrupt end in 1920, after the [[battle of Maysaloun]], when the French Forces of [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|General Gouraud]] entered [[Damascus]] under the command of General [[Mariano Goybet]], destroying Lawrence's dream of an independent Arabia</span>

				<span class='text'>In addition to being a memoir of his experiences during the war, certain parts also serve as essays on [[military strategy]], Arabian culture and [[geography]], and other topics</span>

				<span class='text'>In reality, this famous camel ride lasted for more than 70 hours and was interrupted by two long breaks for sleeping, which Lawrence omitted when he wrote his book</span>

				<span class='text'>Page 259</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Lawrence acknowledged having been helped in the editing of the book by [[George Bernard Shaw]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the preface to ''Seven Pillars'', Lawrence offered his &quot;thanks to Mr</span>

				<span class='text'>Lawrence was afraid that the public would think that he would make a substantial income from the book, and he stated that it was written as a result of his war service</span>
				<span class='text'>He vowed not to take any money from it, and indeed he did not, as the sale price was one third of the production costs</span>

				<span class='text'>Again he vowed not to take any fees from the publication, partly to appease the subscribers to ''Seven Pillars'' who had paid dearly for their editions</span>
				<span class='text'>By the fourth reprint in 1927, the debt from ''Seven Pillars'' was paid off</span>
				<span class='text'>As Lawrence left for military service in India at the end of 1926, he set up the &quot;Seven Pillars Trust&quot; with his friend [[David George Hogarth|D</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>Hogarth]] as a trustee, in which he made over the copyright and any surplus income of ''Revolt in the Desert''</span>
				<span class='text'>He later told Hogarth that he had &quot;made the Trust final, to save myself the temptation of reviewing it, if ''Revolt'' turned out a best seller</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;The resultant trust paid off the debt, and Lawrence then invoked a clause in his publishing contract to halt publication of the abridgment in the United Kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he allowed both American editions and translations, which resulted in a substantial flow of income</span>
				<span class='text'>The trust paid income either into an educational fund for children of RAF officers who lost their lives or were invalided as a result of service, or more substantially into the [[RAF Benevolent Fund]]</span>
