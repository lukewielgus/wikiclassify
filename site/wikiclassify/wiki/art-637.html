				<span class='text'>Her introduction to American audiences came with her starring role in the English-language remake of ''[[Intermezzo (1939 film)|Intermezzo]]'' (1939)</span>
				<span class='text'>At her insistence, producer [[David O</span>

				<span class='text'>The affair and then marriage with Rossellini created a scandal in the US that forced her to remain in Europe for several years, when she made a successful Hollywood return in ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), for which she won her second Academy Award</span>

				<span class='text'>In the years before he died, he wanted her to become an opera star, and had her take voice lessons for three years</span>
				<span class='text'>But she always &quot;knew from the beginning that she wanted to be an actress,&quot; sometimes wearing her mother's clothes and staging plays in her father's empty studio</span>

				<span class='text'>She then moved in with her Aunt Hulda and Uncle Otto, who had five children</span>
				<span class='text'>Another aunt she visited, Elsa Adler, first told Ingrid, when she was 11, that her mother may have had &quot;some Jewish blood,&quot; and that her father was aware of that fact long before they married</span>
				<span class='text'>But her aunt also cautioned her about telling others about her possible ancestry as &quot;there might be some difficult times coming&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt;{{rp|294}}As a result, she received a scholarship to the state-sponsored [[Royal Dramatic Theatre School]], where [[Greta Garbo]] had some years earlier earned a similar scholarship</span>
				<span class='text'>After several months she was given a part in a new play, ''Ett Brott'' (''A Crime''), written by Sigfrid Siwertz</span>
				<span class='text'>Chandler notes that this was &quot;totally against procedure&quot; at the school, where girls were expected to complete three years of study before getting such acting roles</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt;{{rp|33}}During her first summer break, she was also hired by a Swedish film studio, which led to her leaving the Royal Dramatic Theatre after just one year, to work in films full-time</span>
				<span class='text'>Her first film role after leaving the Royal Dramatic Theatre was a small part in 1935's ''Munkbrogreven'' (although she had previously been an extra in the 1932 film ''Landskamp'')</span>
				<span class='text'>She went on to act in a dozen films in [[Sweden]], including ''[[En kvinnas ansikte]],'' which was later remade as ''[[A Woman's Face]]'' with [[Joan Crawford]], and one film in [[Germany]], ''Die vier Gesellen'' (''[[The Four Companions (film)|The Four Companions]]'') (1938)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;imdb&quot;/&gt;==Hollywood period: 1939‚Äì49=====''Intermezzo: A Love Story'' (1939)===Bergman's first acting role in the United States came when [[Hollywood]] producer [[David O</span>

				<span class='text'>Unable to speak English and uncertain about her acceptance by the American audience, she expected to complete this one film and return home to Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>Her husband, Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Petter Lindstr√∂m, remained in Sweden with their daughter Pia (born 1938)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt;{{rp|63}} In ''Intermezzo'', she played the role of a young piano accompanist opposite [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]] as a famous violin virtuoso</span>
				<span class='text'>She arrived in [[Los Angeles]] on 6 May 1939, and stayed at the Selznick home until she could find another residence</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Selznick's son, Danny, who was a child at the time, his father had a few concerns about Ingrid: &quot;She didn't speak English, she was too tall, her name sounded too German, and her eyebrows were too thick</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Bergman was soon accepted without having to modify her looks or name, despite some early suggestions by Selznick</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt;{{rp|6}} &quot;He let her have her way,&quot; notes a story in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine</span>
				<span class='text'>Selznick understood her fear of Hollywood make-up artists, who might turn her into someone she wouldn't recognize, and &quot;instructed them to lay off&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also aware that her natural good looks would compete successfully with Hollywood's &quot;synthetic razzle-dazzle</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=LifeMag/&gt; During the following weeks, while ''Intermezzo'' was being filmed, Selznick was also filming ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' In a letter to William Hebert, his publicity director, Selznick described a few of his early impressions of Bergman:{{quote|Miss Bergman is the most completely conscientious actress with whom I have ever worked, in that she thinks of absolutely nothing but her work before and during the time she is doing a picture&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>She practically never leaves the studio, and even suggested that her dressing room be equipped so that she could live here during the picture</span>
				<span class='text'>She never for a minute suggests quitting at six o'clock or anything of the kind&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Because of having four stars acting in ''Gone with the Wind,'' our star dressing-room suites were all occupied and we had to assign her a smaller suite</span>
				<span class='text'>She went into ecstasies over it and said she had never had such a suite in her life&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>All of this is completely unaffected and completely unique and I should think would make a grand angle of approach to her publicity&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>Bergman had championed the role since her arrival in Hollywood, which was one of the reasons she had played it on the Broadway stage in Anderson's play</span>
