				<span class='text'>sman announced the independence of his own small principality from the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]] in July 27, 1299, and was acclaimed the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Kayƒ± tribe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The Ottoman principality was just one of [[Anatolian Turkish beyliks|many small Turkish principalities]] in [[Anatolia]] at the time that emerged after the dissolution of the Seljuks, all of which the Ottomans would eventually conquer to reunite Anatolia under Turkish rule</span>
				<span class='text'>The westward drive of the [[Mongol invasions]] had pushed scores of Muslims toward Osman's principality, a power base that Osman was quick to consolidate</span>
				<span class='text'>As the [[Byzantine Empire]] declined, the Ottoman Empire rose to take its place</span>
				<span class='text'>=Controversy in the origins of his name &quot;Osman&quot;==[[File:I Osman</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|180px|left|Ottoman miniature painting depicting Osman I]]Since the classical era of the Ottoman Empire, it has been believed that Osman I was named after [[Uthman ibn Affan]], who was the third [[Rashidun]] caliph of Islam and one of the [[Sahabah|companions]] of the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, some historians claim that Osman I's original name was &quot;Atman&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Watch Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Levent Kayapinar's (Byzantinist) claims on this issue broadcast on Haberturk, a noted Turkish news channel</span>
				<span class='text'>http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>outube</span>
				<span class='text'>om/watch?v=Xz0GfJizto4&lt;/ref&gt; This claim is based on the chronicles written by Byzantine historian [[George Pachymeres]], who is contemporary to Osman I</span>
				<span class='text'>The letter ÿ´ in ÿπÿ´ŸÖÿßŸÜ gives sibilant voiceless alveolar fricative sound and it is translated as &quot;th&quot; to the Latin script</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore Osman is translated as &quot;Ottomanus&quot; to Latin and the name of the empire is translated as Ottoman</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the Greek letter sigma &quot;Œ£&quot; is already a sibilant consonant and ÿπ in ÿπÿ´ŸÖÿßŸÜ should be translated to Greek as omicron or omega instead of alpha in the chronicles</span>
				<span class='text'>nother supporting argument to this claim is that neither Osman I's ancestors nor his uncles, brothers, and lieutenants have Islamic names</span>
				<span class='text'>His grandfather, however, is commonly believed to be [[Suleyman Shah]], whose name is Islamic</span>
				<span class='text'>Being nomads, his ancestors were exposed to Islamic culture very little and they first started to live a sedentary life during the leadership of [[Ertuƒürul]] in [[S√∂ƒü√ºt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Osman I is claimed to have first seen a [[Quran]] in the house of [[Sheikh Edebali]], whose daughter married later Osman I</span>
				<span class='text'>Osman I's eldest son and successor was [[Orhan]], whose name has also origins in old Turkish</span>
				<span class='text'>The first Islamic name in Osman I's lineage is his son &quot;Alaeddin&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He is possibly named after Alaeddin Keykubad III (died 1303), who was the Seljuk Sultan of R√ªm of the era, as a tribute</span>
				<span class='text'>=Origins of empire=={{Details|Foundation of Ottoman Empire}}One tradition states that [[Ertuƒürul]], Osman I's father, led the Turkic [[Kayƒ± tribe]] west from Central Asia into [[Anatolia]], fleeing the [[Mongol]] onslaught</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Shaw-13&gt;Stanford Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey'' (Cambridge: University Press, 1976), vol</span>
				<span class='text'>1 p</span>
				<span class='text'>13&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was named [[Halime Hatun|Halime]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He pledged allegiance to [[Sultan]] [[Kayqubad I]] [[Seljuks of Rum|of the Seljuk principality of Rum]], who gave him permission to establish a [[Anatolian beyliks|beylik]] and expand it if he could, at the expense of the neighboring [[Byzantine]] provinces</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Osman I area map</span>
				<span class='text'>NG|thumb|left|300px|Area of the Ottoman Empire during the reign of Osman I]]This location was auspicious, as the wealthy Byzantine Empire was weakening to his West, while in the east, Muslim forces under the Seljuk Turks were splintered and distracted in the face of relentless Mongol aggression as well as internal bickering</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the period following the decisive [[Battle of K√∂se Daƒü]], see Claude Cahen, ''Pre-Ottoman Turkey: A general survey of the material and spiritual culture and history c</span>
				<span class='text'>1071-1330'' (New York: Taplinger, 1968), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>269&amp;mdash;325&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sack of Baghdad|Baghdad had been sacked]] by [[Hulagu Khan]] in 1258, about the time Osman was born</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1231, Ertuƒürul conquered the Nicean (Byzantine) town of Thebasion, which was renamed to [[S√∂ƒü√ºt]] and became the first capital of his territory‚Äîand where Osman was born</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Shaw-13/&gt;Ottoman historians often dwell on the prophetic significance of his name, which means &quot;bone-breaker&quot;, signifying the powerful energy with which he and his followers appeared to show in the following centuries of conquest</span>
				<span class='text'>The name Osman is the Turkish variation of the name [[Uthman (name)|Uthman]], of Arabic origin</span>
				<span class='text'>sman became chief, or [[Bey]], upon his father‚Äôs death (c</span>
				<span class='text'>1280)</span>
				<span class='text'>By this time, mercenaries were streaming into his realm from all over the Islamic world to fight against and hopefully plunder the weakening Byzantine empire</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, the Turkic population of Osman's emirate were constantly reinforced by a flood of refugees, fleeing from the Mongols</span>
				<span class='text'>Of these, many were [[Ghazi warriors]], or fighters for Islam, border fighters who believed they were fighting for the expansion or defense of Islam</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the strong and able leadership of Osman, these warriors quickly proved a formidable force, and the foundations of the Empire were quickly laid</span>
				<span class='text'>sman appears to have followed the strategy of increasing his territories at the expense of the Byzantines while avoiding conflict with his more powerful Turkish neighbors</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Shaw-13/&gt; His first advances were through the passes which lead from the barren areas of northern Phrygia near modern [[Eski≈üehir]] into the more fertile plains of Bithynia; according to Stanford Shaw, these conquests were achieved against the local Byzantine nobles, &quot;some of whom were defeated in battle, others being absorbed peacefully by purchase contracts, marriage contracts, and the like</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Shaw-14&gt;Shaw, ''Ottoman Empire'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>14&lt;/ref&gt;These early victories and exploits are favorite subjects of Ottoman writers, especially in love stories of his wooing and winning the fair [[Mal Hatun]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These legends have been romanticized by the poetical pens which recorded them in later years</span>
				<span class='text'>The Ottoman writers attached great importance to this legendary, dreamlike conception of the founder of their empire</span>
				<span class='text'>=Osman's Dream=={{main|Osman's Dream}}Osman Gazi appreciated the opinions of the famous [[Ahis|Ahi]] [[Sheikh]], [[Sheik Edebali]], and he respected him</span>
				<span class='text'>Osman often visited Edebali in his home at [[Eskisehir]] where a [[dervish]] group met</span>
				<span class='text'>ne night, when Osman was a guest in Edebali‚Äôs [[dergah]], he had a dream</span>
				<span class='text'>As the sun rose, he went to Edebali and told him, ‚ÄúMy Sheik, I saw you in my dream</span>
				<span class='text'>A moon appeared in your breast</span>
				<span class='text'>It rose, rose and then descended into my breast</span>
				<span class='text'>From my navel there sprang a tree</span>
				<span class='text'>It grew and branched out so much, that the shadow of its branches covered the whole world</span>
				<span class='text'>What does my dream mean?‚ÄùAfter a brief silence, Edebali interpreted:‚ÄúCongratulations Osman! God Almighty bestowed sovereignty upon you and your generation</span>
				<span class='text'>My daughter will be your wife, and the whole world will be under the protection of your children</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù==Military victories==[[Image:Osman</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Illustration of Osman rallying Gazi warriors into battle</span>
				<span class='text'>]According to Shaw, Osman's first real conquests followed the collapse of Seljuk authority when he was able to occupy the fortresses of Eski≈üehir and [[Karacahisar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Then he captured the first significant city in his territories, [[Yeni≈üehir, Bursa|Yeni≈üehir]], which became the Ottoman capital</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Shaw-14/&gt;In 1302, after soundly [[Battle of Bapheus|defeating a Byzantine force]] near [[Nicaea]], Osman began settling his forces closer to Byzantine controlled areas</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;32&lt;/ref&gt; Large numbers of [[Ghazi warriors]], [[Islamic]] scholars and [[dervishes]] began settling in Osman-controlled areas, and migrants composed the bulk of his army</span>
				<span class='text'>The influx of Ghazi warriors and adventurers of differing backgrounds into these lands spurred subsequent Ottoman rulers to title themselves &quot;Sultan of Ghazis&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Steven Runciman pg 32&quot;/&gt;Alarmed by Osman's growing influence, the Byzantines gradually fled the Anatolian countryside</span>
				<span class='text'>Byzantine leadership attempted to contain Ottoman expansion, but their efforts were poorly organized and ineffectual</span>
				<span class='text'> Meanwhile, Osman spent the remainder of his reign expanding his control in two directions, north along the course of the [[Sakarya River]] and southwest towards the [[Sea of Marmora]], achieving his objectives by 1308</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Shaw-14/&gt; That same year his followers participated in conquest of the Byzantine city of [[Ephesus]] near the [[Aegean Sea]], thus capturing the last Byzantine city on the coast, although the city became part of the domain of the Emir of [[Aydin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Steven Runciman pg 32&quot;/&gt;Osman's last campaign was against the city of [[Bursa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Runciman, ''The Fall of Constantinople'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;33&lt;/ref&gt; Although Osman did not physically participate in the battle, [[Siege of Brusa|the victory at Bursa]] proved to be extremely vital for the Ottomans as the city served as a staging ground against the Byzantines in [[Constantinople]], and as a newly adorned capital for Osman's son, [[Orhan I|Orhan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Last testament==In directing his son to continue the administrative policies set forth by [[Sheik Edebali]], Osman stated:{{quote|Son! Be careful about the religious issues before all other duties</span>
				<span class='text'>The religious precepts build a strong state</span>
				<span class='text'>Do not give religious duties to careless, faithless and sinful men or to dissipated, indifferent or inexperienced people</span>
