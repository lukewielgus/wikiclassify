				<span class='text'>Gregory VII | author = Thomas Oestreich}}&lt;/ref&gt;One of the great reforming popes, he is perhaps best known for the part he played in the [[Investiture Controversy]], his dispute with [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] that affirmed the primacy of papal authority and the new canon law governing the election of the pope by the [[College of Cardinals]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also at the forefront of developments in the relationship between the emperor and the papacy during the years before he became pope</span>
				<span class='text'> He was the first pope in several centuries to rigorously enforce the Western Church's ancient policy of [[celibacy]] for the clergy and attacked the practice of [[simony]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Hailed as one of the greatest of the Roman pontiffs after his reforms proved successful, Gregory VII was, during his own reign, despised by some for his expansive use of papal powers</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The Pope having been such a prominent champion of papal supremacy, his memory was evoked on many occasions in later generations, both positively and negatively, often reflecting later writers' attitude to the Catholic Church and the papacy</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Benno of Meissen]], who opposed Gregory VII in the Investiture Controversy, leveled against him charges such as [[necromancy]], torture of a former friend upon a bed of nails, commissioning an attempted assassination, executions without trials, unjust excommunication, doubting the Real Presence of the [[Eucharist]], and even burning the Eucharist</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Biography=====Early career===Gregory was born as ''Ildebrando di Soana'' in [[Sovana]], in [[Grosseto|the county of Grosseto]], now southern [[Tuscany]], central [[Italy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was said to be of humble origins</span>
				<span class='text'>One finds in [[Johann Georg Estor]] the claim that he was the son of a [[blacksmith]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Johann Georg Estor, ''Probe einer verbesserten Heraldic'' (Giessen 1728), &quot;vorrede&quot;:  ''Das Pabst Hildebrand ein Zimmermanns Sohn gewesen, we noch der Pater Daniel in der netten Historie von Franckreich geglaubet, rechnete der Pater Maimburg und Pater Pagi nicht unbillig zu eben dieser Ordnung''</span>
				<span class='text'>Francesco Pagi, ''Breviarium historico-chronologico criticum'' Tomus II (Antwerp 1717),  p</span>
				<span class='text'>417, attributes to Cardinal Baronius the notion that the father was a ''faber'', but that Papebroch considered him to be of noble stock</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As a youth he was sent to study in Rome, where, according to some unconfirmed sources, his uncle was abbot of a monastery on the [[Aventine Hill]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The monastery would have been that of S</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregorio Magno</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Among his masters were the erudite Lawrence, [[archbishop of Amalfi]], and Johannes Gratianus, the future [[Pope Gregory VI]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Cowdrey, p</span>
				<span class='text'>29}} When the latter was deposed by Holy Roman Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] and exiled to [[Germany]], Hildebrand followed him to [[Cologne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to some chroniclers, Hildebrand moved to [[Cluny]] after Gregory's death, which occurred in 1048;&lt;ref name=Butler/&gt; his declaration to have become a monk at Cluny must not be taken literally</span>
				<span class='text'>He then accompanied [[Abbot]] [[Leo IX|Bruno of Toul]] to Rome; there, Bruno was elected Pope, choosing the name [[Pope Leo IX|Leo IX]], and named Hildebrand as [[deacon]] and papal administrator</span>
				<span class='text'>Leo sent Hildebrand as his [[papal legate|legate]] to [[Tours]] in [[France]] in the wake of the controversy created by [[Berengar of Tours]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At Leo's death, the new Pope, [[Pope Victor II|Victor II]], confirmed him as legate, while Victor's successor [[Stephen IX]] sent him and [[Pope Alexander II|Anselm of Lucca]] to Germany to obtain recognition from the Empress [[Agnes de Poitou]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Stephen died before being able to return to Rome, but Hildebrand was successful; he was then instrumental in overcoming the crisis caused by the Roman aristocracy's election of an antipope, [[Antipope Benedict X|Benedict X]],&lt;ref&gt;According to the sources, feeling he was nearing his end, Stephen had his cardinals swear that they would wait for Hildebrand's return to Rome before electing his successor</span>

				<span class='text'>With the help of 300 Norman knights sent by [[Richard I of Capua|Richard of Aversa]], Hildebrand personally led the conquest of the castle of Galeria Antica&lt;ref&gt;[http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>tml &quot;La citt√† perduta di Galeria&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; where Benedict had taken refuge</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;He was again the most powerful figure behind the election of Anselm of Lucca the Elder as [[Pope Alexander II]] in the [[Papal election, 1061|papal election of October 1061]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Butler/&gt; The new pope put forward the reform program devised by Hildebrand and his followers</span>
				<span class='text'>In his years as papal advisor, Hildebrand had an important role in the reconciliation with the [[Italo-Normans|Norman kingdom of southern Italy]], in the anti-German alliance with the [[Pataria]] movement in northern Italy and, above all, in the introduction of a law which gave the cardinals exclusive rights concerning the election of a new pope</span>

				<span class='text'>On the death of Alexander II on 21 April 1073, as the obsequies were being performed in the [[Lateran Basilica]], there arose a loud outcry from the clergy and people: &quot;Let Hildebrand be pope!&quot;, &quot;Blessed Peter has chosen Hildebrand the Archdeacon!&quot;  Hildebrand immediately fled, and hid himself for some time, thereby making it clear that he had refused the uncanonical election in the Liberian Basilica</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; He was finally found at the Church of [[San Pietro in Vincoli]], to which a famous monastery was attached, and [[Papal election, 1086|elected Pope]] there in legal form by the assembled cardinals, with the due consent of the Roman clergy, amid the repeated [[Acclamation (Papal elections)|acclamations]] of the people</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;It was debated at the time ‚Äì and remains debated by historians ‚Äì whether this extraordinary outburst in favour of Hildebrand by clergy and people was wholly spontaneous or could have been the result of some pre-concerted arrangements</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;CE&quot;/&gt; According to Benizo, Bishop of Sutri, a supporter of Hildebrand, the outcry was begun by the actions of Cardinal Ugo Candidus, Cardinal Priest of S</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Certainly, the mode of his election was highly criticized by his opponents</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the charges brought may have been expressions of personal dislike, liable to suspicion from the very fact that they were not raised to attack his promotion until several years later</span>
				<span class='text'>But it is clear from Gregory's own account of the circumstances of his election,&lt;ref&gt;J</span>

				<span class='text'>Migne (editor), ''Patrologia Latina'' Volume 148, columns 235-237</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; in his Epistle 1 and Epistle 2, that it was conducted in a very irregular fashion</span>
				<span class='text'>First of all, it was contrary to the Constitution of Pope promulgated and approved in the Roman Synod of 607, which forbade a papal election to begin until the third day after a pope's burial</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Liber Pontificalis, in ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica'' Scriptores,  Volume 5 (Hannover 1844), p</span>
				<span class='text'>164 (ed</span>
				<span class='text'>Mommsen), p</span>
				<span class='text'>164: ''Hic fecit constitutum in ecclesia beati Petri, in quo sederunt episcopi LXXII, presbiteri Romani XXXIII, diaconi et clerus omnis, sub anathemate, ut nullus pontificem viventem aut episcopum civitatis suae praesumat loqui aut partes sibi facere nisi tertio die depositionis eius adunato clero et filiis ecclesiae, tunc electio fiat, et quis quem voluerit habebit licentiam eligendi sibi sacerdotem''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal Ugo's intervention was contrary to the Constitution of Nicholas II, which affirmed the exclusive right to name candidates to the Cardinal Bishops;  finally, the requirement of Pope Nicholas II that the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] be consulted in the matter was ignored</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The ''Annales'' of Lambertus of Hersfeld , in ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica''  Scriptorum  5 (1844), p</span>
				<span class='text'>194, states that Gregory did wait for a reply from the Emperor: ''cogi tamen nullo modo potuisse, ut ordinari se permitteret, donec in electionem suam tam regem quam principes Teutonici regni consensisse certa legatione cognosceret''</span>
				<span class='text'> Whether he got it, or whether the response was positive, is another matter</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, what ultimately turned the tide in favor of validity of Gregory VII's election was the second election at S</span>
				<span class='text'>Pietro in Vincoli and the acceptance by the Roman people</span>
				<span class='text'>regory VII's earliest pontifical letters clearly acknowledge this fact, and thus helped defuse any doubt about his election as immensely popular</span>
				<span class='text'>On 22 May 1073, the Feast of Pentecost, he received [[Presbyterate|ordination as a priest]], and he was consecrated a [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] and enthroned as  pope on 29 June (the Feast of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter's Chair)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;&gt;{{Cite EB1911 | wstitle=Gregory (Popes)/Gregory VII}}&lt;/ref&gt;In the decree of election, those who had chosen him as Bishop of Rome proclaimed Gregory VII ‚Äúa devout man, a man mighty in human and divine knowledge, a distinguished lover of equity and justice, a man firm in adversity and temperate in prosperity, a man, according to the saying of the Apostle, of good behavior, blameless, modest, sober, chaste, given to hospitality, and one that ruleth well his own house; a man from his childhood generously brought up in the bosom of this Mother Church, and for the merit of his life already raised to the archidiaconal dignity‚Äù</span>
				<span class='text'>‚ÄúWe choose then‚Äù, they said to the people, ‚Äúour Archdeacon Hildebrand to be pope and successor to the Apostle, and to bear henceforward and forever the name of Gregory‚Äù (22 April 1073)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Gregory VII's first attempts in foreign policy were towards a reconciliation with the Normans of [[Robert Guiscard]]; in the end the two parties did not meet</span>
				<span class='text'>After a failed call for a [[Crusades|crusade]] to the princes of northern Europe,&lt;ref name=&quot;Paravicini Bagliani 76&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first=Agostino|last=Paravicini Bagliani|title=Sia fatta la mia volont√†|journal=Medioevo|issue=143|date=December 2008|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after obtaining the support of other Norman princes such as [[Landulf VI of Benevento]] and [[Richard I of Capua]], Gregory VII was able to excommunicate Robert in 1074</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same year Gregory VII summoned a council in the Lateran palace, which condemned [[simony]] and confirmed [[celibacy]] for the Church's clergy</span>
				<span class='text'>These decrees were further stressed, under menace of excommunication, the next year (24‚Äì28 February)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Paravicini Bagliani 76&quot;/&gt; In particular, Gregory decreed in this second council that only the Pope could appoint or depose bishops or move them from [[diocese|see]] to see, an act which was later to cause the [[Investiture Controversy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Vestments===Writing in ''[[L‚ÄôOsservatore Romano]]'', [[Agostino Paravicini Bagliani]] says that the popular belief that [[Pope Pius V|St</span>

				<span class='text'>Instead, writes Bagliani, the first document that mentions the Pope‚Äôs white cassock dates from Gregory X in 1274</span>
				<span class='text'>‚ÄúThe first pope to be solemnly invested with the red mantle immediately after his election was Gregory VII (1076),‚Äù the scholar added, noting that traditionally ‚Äúfrom the moment of his election the Pope put on vestments of two colors: red (cope, mozzetta, shoes); and white (cassock, socks)</span>

				<span class='text'>Since the death of Holy Roman Emperor Henry III, the strength of the German monarchy had been seriously weakened, and his son [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] had to contend with great internal difficulties</span>
				<span class='text'>This state of affairs was of material assistance to Gregory VII</span>
				<span class='text'>His advantage was further enhanced by the fact that in 1073 Henry IV was only twenty-three years of age</span>
				<span class='text'>n the two years following the election of Gregory VII, Henry was forced by the [[Saxon Rebellion]] to come to amicable terms with him at any cost</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently, in May 1074 he did penance at [[Nuremberg]] ‚Äì in the presence of the papal legates ‚Äì to atone for his continued friendship with the members of his council who had been banned by Gregory, took an oath of obedience, and promised his support in the work of reforming the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>This attitude, however, which at first won him the confidence of the pope, was abandoned as soon as he defeated the [[Saxons]] at the [[First Battle of Langensalza]] on 9 June 1075 (also called the [[Battle of Homburg]] or [[Battle of Hohenburg]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry then tried to reassert his rights as the sovereign of northern Italy without delay</span>
				<span class='text'>He sent Count Eberhard to [[Lombardy]] to combat the [[Pataria|Patarenes]]; nominated the cleric Tedaldo to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|archbishopric of Milan]], thus settling a prolonged and contentious question; and finally tried to establish relations with the Norman duke [[Robert Guiscard]]</span>
				<span class='text'>regory VII replied with a rough letter, dated 8 December 1075, in which, among other charges, he accused the German king of breaching his word and with his continued support of excommunicated councilors</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, he sent a verbal message suggesting that the enormous crimes which would be laid to his account rendered him liable, not only to the ban of the Church, but to the deprivation of his crown</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory did this at a time when he himself was confronted by a reckless opponent in the person of [[Cencio I Frangipane]], who on [[Christmas]] night surprised him in church and carried him off as a prisoner, though on the following day Gregory was released</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt;===Pope and Emperor depose each other===The reprimands of the Pope, couched as they were in such an unprecedented form, infuriated Henry and his court, and their answer was the hastily convened national council in [[Worms, Germany]] (the [[synod of Worms]]), which met on 24 January 1076</span>
				<span class='text'>In the higher ranks of the German clergy Gregory had many enemies, and a Roman cardinal, [[Hugo Candidus]], once on intimate terms with him but now his opponent, had hurried to Germany for the occasion</span>
				<span class='text'>All the accusations with regard to Gregory that Candidus could come up with were well received by the assembly, which committed itself to the resolution that Gregory had forfeited the papacy</span>
				<span class='text'>In one document full of accusations, the bishops renounced their allegiance to Gregory</span>
				<span class='text'>In another, Henry pronounced him deposed, and the Romans were required to choose a new pope</span>

				<span class='text'>Roland of Parma informed the pope of these decisions, and he was fortunate enough to gain an opportunity for speech in the synod, which had just assembled in the [[Lateran Basilica]], to deliver his message there announcing the dethronement</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Pope Zachary]] had brought significant challenges to rulers of his era a full 200 years earlier, in a move [[Thomas Hobbes]] would famously call &quot;one of the greatest abuses of the papacy in the history of the Church&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>his sentence purported to eject a ruler from the Church and to strip him of his crown</span>
				<span class='text'>Whether it would produce this effect, or would be an idle threat, depended not so much on Gregory VII as on Henry's subjects, and, above all, on the German princes</span>
				<span class='text'>Contemporary evidence suggests that the [[excommunication]] of Henry made a profound impression both in Germany and Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>hirty years before, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] had deposed three claimants to the papacy, and thereby rendered an acknowledged service to the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>When Henry IV tried to copy this procedure he was less successful, as he lacked the support of the people</span>
				<span class='text'>In Germany there was a rapid and general feeling in favor of Gregory, and the princes took the opportunity to carry out their anti-regal policy under the cloak of respect for the papal decision</span>
				<span class='text'>When at [[Whitsun]] the king proposed to discuss the measures to be taken against Gregory VII in a council of his nobles, only a few made their appearance; the Saxons snatched at the golden opportunity for renewing their rebellion, and the anti-royalist party grew in strength from month to month</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt;===Walk to Canossa==={{Main|Walk to Canossa}}The situation now became extremely critical for Henry</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result of the agitation, which was zealously fostered by the papal legate Bishop Altmann of Passau, the princes met in October at [[Trebur]] to elect a new German ruler</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry, who was stationed at [[Oppenheim]] on the left bank of the [[Rhine]], was only saved from the loss of his throne by the failure of the assembled princes to agree on the question of his successor</span>
				<span class='text'>heir dissension, however, merely induced them to postpone the verdict</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry, they declared, must make reparation to Gregory VII and pledge himself to obedience; and they decided that, if, on the anniversary of his excommunication, he still lay under the ban, the throne should be considered vacant</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time they decided to invite Gregory VII to [[Augsburg]] to decide the conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>hese arrangements showed Henry the course to be pursued</span>
				<span class='text'>It was imperative under any circumstances and at any price to secure his absolution from Gregory before the period named, otherwise he could scarcely foil his opponents in their intention to pursue their attack against him and justify their measures by an appeal to his excommunication</span>
				<span class='text'>At first he attempted to attain his ends by an embassy, but when Gregory rejected his overtures he took the celebrated step of going to Italy in person</span>
				<span class='text'>regory VII had already left Rome and had intimated to the German princes that he would expect their escort for his journey on 8 January to [[Mantua]]</span>
				<span class='text'>But this escort had not appeared when he received the news of Henry's arrival</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry, who had travelled through [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], had been greeted with enthusiasm by the Lombards, but resisted the temptation to employ force against Gregory</span>
				<span class='text'>He chose the unexpected course of forcing Gregory to grant him absolution by doing penance before him at [[Canossa]], where he had taken refuge</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Walk to Canossa]] soon became legendary</span>
				<span class='text'>he reconciliation was only effected after prolonged negotiations and definite pledges on the part of Henry, and it was with reluctance that Gregory VII at length gave way, considering the political implications</span>
				<span class='text'>If Gregory VII granted absolution, the [[diet (assembly)|diet]] of princes in Augsburg in which he might reasonably hope to act as arbitrator would either become useless, or, if it met at all, would change completely in character</span>
				<span class='text'>It was impossible, however, to deny the penitent re-entrance into the Church, and Gregory VII's religious obligations overrode his political interests</span>
				<span class='text'>he removal of the ban did not imply a genuine reconciliation, and no basis was gained for a settlement of the main question that divided Henry and Gregory: that of [[investiture]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A new conflict was inevitable from the very fact that Henry considered the sentence of deposition repealed along with that of excommunication</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory, on the other hand, was intent on reserving his freedom of action and gave no hint on the subject at Canossa &lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt;===Second excommunication of Henry IV===That the excommunication of Henry IV was simply a pretext for the opposition of the rebellious German nobles is transparent</span>
				<span class='text'>Not only did they persist in their policy after his absolution, but they took the more decided step of setting up a rival ruler in the person of [[Rudolf of Rheinfelden|Duke Rudolf of Swabia]] at [[Forchheim]] in March 1077</span>
				<span class='text'>At the election, the papal legates present observed the appearance of neutrality, and Gregory VII himself sought to maintain this attitude during the following years</span>
				<span class='text'>His task was made easier in that the two parties were of fairly equal strength, each trying to gain the upper hand by getting the pope on their side</span>
				<span class='text'>But the result of his non-committal policy was that he largely lost the confidence of both parties</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally he decided for Rudolf of Swabia after his victory at the [[Battle of Flarchheim]] on 27 January 1080</span>
				<span class='text'>Under pressure from the Saxons, and misinformed as to the significance of this battle, Gregory abandoned his waiting policy and again pronounced the excommunication and deposition of King Henry on 7 March 1080</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Emerton, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>149-154</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;But the papal censure now proved a very different thing from the one four years before</span>
				<span class='text'>It was widely felt to be an injustice, and people began to ask whether an excommunication pronounced on frivolous grounds was entitled to respect</span>
				<span class='text'> The king, now more experienced, took up the struggle with great vigour</span>
				<span class='text'>He refused to acknowledge the ban on the ground of its illegality</span>
				<span class='text'>He then summoned a Council, which met at [[Brixen]], and on 16 June,  pronounced Gregory deposed</span>
				<span class='text'>It nominated the archbishop Guibert (Wibert) of Ravenna as his successor</span>
				<span class='text'>On 25 June 1280, Guibert was elected Pope by the thirty bishops who were present at the King's command</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  On 15 October 1080, Pope Gregory advised the clergy and laity to elect a new archbishop in place of the &quot;mad&quot; and &quot;tyrannical&quot; schismatic Wibert</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1081 Henry opened the conflict against Gregory in Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory's support had by that time weakened,&lt;ref&gt;He complained in a letter to King Alfonso of Leon and Castile in 1081 that he had a large number of detractors, whose complaints were widely spread, and whom he names as &quot;liars&quot;: Jaffe ''Bibliotheca'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>470-473</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and thirteen cardinals had deserted him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt;  To make matters worse, Rudolf of Swabia died on 16 October of the same year</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry was now in a stronger position and Gregory a weaker one</span>
				<span class='text'>A new claimant, [[Hermann of Luxembourg]], was put forward in August 1081, but his personality was not suitable for a leader of the Gregorian party in Germany, and the power of Henry IV was at its peak</span>

				<span class='text'>100</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; blocked Henry's armies from the western passages over the [[Apennines]], so he had to approach Rome from [[Ravenna]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Rome surrendered to the German king in 1084, and Gregory thereupon retired into the exile of the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Peters|1971|p=33}} Gregory refused to entertain Henry's overtures, although the latter promised to hand over Guibert as a prisoner, if the sovereign pontiff would only consent to crown him emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory, however, insisted as a necessary preliminary that Henry should appear before a Council and do penance</span>
				<span class='text'>The emperor, while pretending to submit to these terms, tried hard to prevent the meeting of the bishops</span>
				<span class='text'>A small number assembled nonetheless, and, in accordance with their wishes, Gregory again excommunicated Henry</span>
				<span class='text'>enry, upon receipt of this news, again entered Rome on 21 March to see that his supporter, Archbishop Guibert of Ravenna, was enthroned as Pope [[Antipope Clement III|Clement III]] on 24 March 1084</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry was crowned emperor by his creature, but Robert Guiscard, with whom in the meantime Gregory had formed an alliance, was already marching on the city</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry was compelled to flee towards [[Civita Castellana]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Exile from Rome===The pope was liberated, but after the Roman people became incensed by the excesses of his Norman allies, he was compelled to withdraw to [[Monte Cassino]],&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Gregorovius, ''History of the City of Rome in the Middle Ages'' (tr</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Peters|1971|p=33}} Three days before his death, he withdrew all the censures of excommunication that he had pronounced, except those against the two chief offenders ‚Äì Henry and Guibert</span>
				<span class='text'>=Papal policy to the rest of Europe=====England===In 1076 Gregory appointed a bishop to the see of Dol, who was neither the candidate of [[William the Conqueror]], who had recently been conducting military operations in north-eastern Britanny, nor the bishop elect of the chapter of the church of St</span>

				<span class='text'>Melanii, one of the procurators sent to Rome, and he also bestowed on him the pallium of a metropolitan archbishop, on the condition that he would submit to the judgment of the Holy See when the long-standing case of the right of Dol to be a metropolitan and use the pallium was finally decided</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;King William felt himself so safe that he interfered autocratically with the management of the church, forbade the bishops to visit Rome, made appointments to [[Diocese|bishoprics]] and [[abbeys]], and showed little anxiety when the pope lectured him on the different principles which he had as to the relationship of spiritual and temporal powers, or when he prohibited him from commerce or commanded him to acknowledge himself a vassal of the apostolic chair</span>
				<span class='text'> William was particularly annoyed at Gregory's insistence on dividing ecclesiastical England into two provinces, in opposition to William's need to emphasize the unity of his newly acquired kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory's increasing insistence on church independence from secular authority in the matter of clerical appointments became a more and more contentious issue</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Normans in the Kingdom of Sicily===The relationship of Gregory VII to other European states was strongly influenced by his German policy, since the [[Holy Roman Empire]], by taking up most of his energies, often forced him to show to other rulers the very moderation which he withheld from the German king</span>
				<span class='text'>The attitude of the Normans brought him a rude awakening</span>
				<span class='text'>The great concessions made to them under Nicholas II were not only powerless to stem their advance into central Italy, but failed to secure even the expected protection for the papacy</span>
				<span class='text'>When Gregory VII was hard pressed by Henry IV, [[Robert Guiscard]] left him to his fate, and only intervened when he himself was threatened with German arms</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, on the capture of Rome, he abandoned the city to his troops, and the popular indignation evoked by his act brought about Gregory's exile</span>
				<span class='text'>==Claims of Papal sovereignty===In the case of several countries, Gregory VII tried to establish a claim of sovereignty on the part of the Papacy, and to secure the recognition of its self-asserted rights of possession</span>
				<span class='text'>On the ground of &quot;immemorial usage&quot;, [[Medieval Corsica|Corsica]] and [[Giudicati|Sardinia]] were assumed to belong to the Roman Church</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Reconquista#Expansion into the Crusades and military orders|Spain]], [[Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages|Hungary]] and  [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croatia]] were also claimed as her property, and an attempt was made to induce the king of [[History of Denmark#Christianity, expansion and the establishment of the Kingdom of Denmark|Denmark]] to hold his realm as a fief from the pope</span>
				<span class='text'>n his treatment of ecclesiastical policy and ecclesiastical reform, Gregory did not stand alone, but found powerful support: in England Archbishop [[Lanfranc]] of [[Canterbury]] stood closest to him; in France his champion was Bishop [[Hugo of Di√©|Hugh de Di√©]], who afterwards became [[Archbishop of Lyon]]</span>

				<span class='text'> Excommunication, deposition and the interdict appeared to be imminent in 1074</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory, however, refrained from translating his threats into actions, although the attitude of the king showed no change, for he wished to avoid a dispersion of his strength in the conflict soon to break out in Germany</span>

				<span class='text'>His correspondence extended to [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Poland]], [[Kievan Rus']] and [[History of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (Middle Ages)|Bohemia]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Byzantine Empire===Gregory was particularly concerned with the East</span>
				<span class='text'>The schism between Rome and the [[Byzantine Empire]] was a severe blow to him, and he worked hard to restore the former amicable relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory successfully tried to get in touch with the emperor [[Michael VII]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When the news of the Muslim attacks on the Christians in the East filtered through to Rome, and the political embarrassments of the [[Byzantine emperor]] increased, he conceived the project of a great military expedition and exhorted the faithful to participate in recovering the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] ‚Äì foreshadowing the [[First Crusade]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Peters|1971|p=33}}==Internal policy and reforms=={{Main|Gregorian Reform}}His lifework was based on his conviction that the Church was founded by God and entrusted with the task of embracing all mankind in a single society in which divine will is the only law; that, in her capacity as a divine institution, she is supreme over all human structures, especially the secular state; and that the pope, in his role as head of the Church, is the vice-regent of God on earth, so that disobedience to him implies disobedience to God: or, in other words, a defection from Christianity</span>
				<span class='text'>But any attempt to interpret this in terms of action would have bound the Church to annihilate not merely a single state, but all states</span>
				<span class='text'>hus Gregory VII, as a politician wanting to achieve some result, was driven in practice to adopt a different standpoint</span>
				<span class='text'>He acknowledged the existence of the state as a dispensation of [[Divine Providence|Providence]], described the coexistence of church and state as a divine ordinance, and emphasized the necessity of union between the ''[[sacerdotium]]'' and the ''imperium''</span>
				<span class='text'>But at no period would he have dreamed of putting the two powers on an equal footing; the superiority of church to state was to him a fact which admitted of no discussion and which he had never doubted</span>
				<span class='text'>e wished to see all important matters of dispute referred to Rome; appeals were to be addressed to himself; the centralization of ecclesiastical government in Rome naturally involved a curtailment of the powers of bishops</span>
				<span class='text'>Since these refused to submit voluntarily and tried to assert their traditional independence, his papacy is full of struggles against the higher ranks of the clergy</span>
				<span class='text'>his battle for the foundation of papal supremacy is connected with his championship of compulsory [[clerical celibacy|celibacy among the clergy]] and his attack on [[simony]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory VII did not introduce the celibacy of the priesthood into the Church, but he took up the struggle with greater energy than his predecessors</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1074 he published an [[encyclical]], absolving the people from their obedience to bishops who allowed married priests</span>
				<span class='text'>The next year he enjoined them to take action against married priests, and deprived these clerics of their revenues</span>
				<span class='text'>Both the campaign against priestly marriage and that against simony provoked widespread resistance</span>
