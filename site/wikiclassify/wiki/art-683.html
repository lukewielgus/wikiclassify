				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Empress Elizabeth by [[Vigilius Eriksen]]]]Elizabeth abolished the cabinet council system that had been used under Anna, and reconstituted the [[Governing Senate|senate]] as it had been under Peter the Great, with the chiefs of the departments of state (none of them Germans) attending</span>
				<span class='text'>Her first task after this was to address the war with [[Sweden]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On 23 January 1743, direct negotiations between the two powers were opened at [[Turku|√Öbo (Turku)]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the [[Treaty of √Öbo]], on 7 August 1743, Sweden ceded to Russia all of southern [[Finland]] east of the [[Kymmene River]], which became the boundary between the two states</span>
				<span class='text'>The treaty also gave Russia the fortresses of [[Villmanstrand]] and [[Hamina|Fredrikshamn]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}This triumphant issue can be credited to the diplomatic ability of the new vice chancellor, [[Aleksey Bestuzhev-Ryumin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His policies would have been impossible without her support</span>

				<span class='text'>''Elizabeth and Catherine'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth had wisely placed Bestuzhev at the head of foreign affairs immediately after her accession</span>
				<span class='text'>He represented the anti-Franco-Prussian portion of her council, and his object was to bring about an Anglo-Austro-Russian alliance which, at that time, was undoubtedly Russia's proper system</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence the bogus [[Lopukhina Conspiracy]] and other attempts of [[Frederick the Great]] and [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] to get rid of Bestuzhev (making the Russian court the centre of a tangle of intrigue during the earlier years of Elizabeth's reign)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}[[Image:Elizabenois</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|''Promenade of Elizaveta Petrovna through the streets of Saint Petersburg'' (1903), watercolour by [[Alexandre Benois]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]Ultimately, the minister's strong support from Elizabeth prevailed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Coughlan&quot;/&gt; His faultless diplomacy, and an auxiliary Russian corps of 30,000 men sent to the [[Rhine]], greatly accelerated the peace negotiations, leading to the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] (18 October 1748)</span>
				<span class='text'>By sheer tenacity of purpose, Bestuzhev had extricated his country from the Swedish imbroglio; reconciled his imperial mistress with the courts of [[Vienna]] and London; enabled Russia to assert herself effectually in [[Poland]], [[Turkey]] and [[Sweden]]; and isolated the King of [[Prussia]] by forcing him into hostile alliances</span>
				<span class='text'>All this would have been impossible without the steady support of Elizabeth who trusted him completely in spite of the Chancellor's many enemies, most of whom were her personal friends</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}However, on 14 February 1758, Chancellor Bestuzhev was removed from office</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; No specific crime was ever pinned on Bestuzhev</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead it was inferred that he had attempted to sow discord between the Empress and her heir and his consort</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Rounding&quot;/&gt; Bestuzhev's enemies were his rivals, the Shuvalov family, Vice-Chancellor [[Mikhail Illarionovich Vorontsov|Mikhail Vorontsov]], and the Austrian and French ambassadors</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|''Elizabeth on Horseback, Attended by a Page''</span>
				<span class='text'>]The great event of Elizabeth's later years was the [[Seven Years' War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Elizabeth regarded the [[Convention of Westminster|treaty of Westminster]] (16 January 1756, whereby [[Great Britain]] and [[Prussia]] agreed to unite their forces to oppose the entry into, or the passage through, [[Germany]] of the troops of every foreign power) as utterly subversive of the previous conventions between Great Britain and Russia</span>
				<span class='text'>Elizabeth sided against Prussia over a personal dislike of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Russian Tsars' p</span>
				<span class='text'>07&quot;/&gt; She wanted him reduced within proper limits, so that he might no longer be a danger to the empire</span>
				<span class='text'>Elizabeth acceded to the treaty of Versailles thus entering into an alliance with France and [[Austria]] against Prussia</span>
				<span class='text'>On 17 May 1757 the Russian army, 85,000 strong, advanced against [[K√∂nigsberg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''The Evolution of Russia'' by Otto Hoetzsch&lt;/ref&gt;Neither the serious illness of the Empress, which began with a fainting-fit at [[Tsarskoe Selo]] (19 September 1757), nor the fall of Bestuzhev (21 February 1758), nor the cabals and intrigues of the various foreign powers at [[Saint Petersburg]], interfered with the progress of the war, and the crushing defeat of [[Battle of Kunersdorf|Kunersdorf]] (12 August 1759)&lt;ref&gt;''The Evolution of Russia'' by Otto Hoetzch, p</span>
				<span class='text'>3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; at last brought Frederick to the verge of ruin</span>
				<span class='text'>From that day forth he despaired of success, though he was saved for the moment by the jealousies of the Russian and Austrian commanders, which ruined the military plans of the allies</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}On the other hand, it is not too much to say that, from the end of 1759 to the end of 1761, the unshakable firmness of the Russian Empress was the one constraining political force which held together the heterogeneous, incessantly jarring elements of the anti-Prussian combination</span>
				<span class='text'>From the Russian point of view, Elizabeth's greatness as a stateswoman consists in her steady appreciation of Russian interests, and her determination to promote them at all hazards</span>
				<span class='text'>She insisted throughout that the King of Prussia must be rendered harmless to his neighbors for the future, and that the only way to bring this about was to reduce him to the rank of a [[Prince-Elector]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}Frederick himself was quite alive to his danger</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I'm at the end of my resources&quot;, he wrote at the beginning of 1760, &quot;the continuance of this war means for me utter ruin</span>
				<span class='text'>Things may drag on perhaps till July, but then a catastrophe must come</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; On 21 May 1760 a fresh convention was signed between Russia and Austria, a secret clause of which, never communicated to the court of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], guaranteed [[East Prussia]] to Russia, as an indemnity for war expenses</span>
				<span class='text'>The failure of the campaign of 1760, wielded by the inept [[Count Buturlin]], induced the court of Versailles, on the evening of 22 January 1761, to present to the court of Saint Petersburg a dispatch to the effect that the king of France by reason of the condition of his dominions absolutely desired peace</span>
				<span class='text'>The Russian empress's reply was delivered to the two ambassadors on 12 February</span>
				<span class='text'>It was inspired by the most uncompromising hostility towards the king of Prussia</span>
				<span class='text'>Elizabeth would not consent to any pacific overtures until the original object of the league had been accomplished</span>

				<span class='text'>]Simultaneously, Elizabeth had conveyed to [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] a confidential letter in which she proposed the signature of a new treaty of alliance of a more comprehensive and explicit nature than the preceding treaties between the two powers, without the knowledge of Austria</span>
				<span class='text'>Elizabeth's object in this mysterious negotiation seems to have been to reconcile France and Great Britain, in return for which signal service France was to throw all her forces into the German war</span>
				<span class='text'>This project, which lacked neither ability nor audacity, foundered upon Louis XV's invincible jealousy of the growth of Russian influence in eastern Europe and his fear of offending the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]</span>

				<span class='text'>May 1756]]As an unmarried and childless Empress, it was imperative for Elizabeth to find a legitimate heir to secure the [[Romanov dynasty]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She chose her nephew, [[Peter III of Russia|Peter of Holstein-Gottorp]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Elizabeth was only too aware that the deposed [[Ivan VI]], whom she had imprisoned in the Schlusselburg Fortress and placed in solitary confinement, was a threat to her throne</span>
				<span class='text'>Elizabeth feared a coup in his favour and set about destroying all papers, coins or anything else depicting or mentioning Ivan</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth had issued an order that, should any attempt be made for him to escape, he was to be eliminated</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The young Peter had lost his mother, Elizabeth's sister Anna, at three months old and his father at the age of eleven</span>
				<span class='text'>Elizabeth invited her young nephew to Saint Petersburg, where he was received into the [[Orthodox Church]] and proclaimed heir on 7 November 1742</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth gave him at once Russian tutors</span>
				<span class='text'>Keen to see the dynasty secured, Elizabeth settled on [[Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst|Princess Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst]] as a bride for her nephew</span>
				<span class='text'>On her conversion to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], Sophie was given the name of Catherine in memory of Elizabeth's mother</span>
				<span class='text'>The marriage took place on 21 August 1745 with a son, the future [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], finally born on 20 September 1754</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;There is considerable speculation as to the actual paternity of Paul I</span>
				<span class='text'>It is suggested that he was not Peter's son at all, but that his mother had engaged in an affair‚Äîto which Elizabeth had consented‚Äîwith a young officer named Serge Saltykov, and that he was Paul's real father</span>

				<span class='text'>150&lt;/ref&gt; In court, this peacemaker spirit also made itself evident</span>
				<span class='text'>According to historian Robert Nisbet Bain, it was one of Elizabeth‚Äôs ‚Äúchief glories that, so far as she was able, she put a stop to that mischievous contention of rival ambitions at Court, which had disgraced the reigns of Peter II, Anne and Ivan VI, and enabled foreign powers to freely interfere in the domestic affairs of Russia</span>

				<span class='text'>149&lt;/ref&gt; Yet of all her various characteristics manifested in the structure of Court life, the most evident were her extravagance; her vanity, and her gaiety and playful nature</span>
				<span class='text'>he notorious extravagance of Elizabeth came to define the Court in many respects</span>
				<span class='text'>Elizabeth created a world in which aesthetics reigned supreme, producing a Court in which an understood competition existed amongst courtiers to see who could look best, second only to Her Majesty</span>
				<span class='text'>As historian [[Mikhail Shcherbatov]] stated, her court was ‚Äúarrayed in cloth of gold, her nobles satisfied with only the most luxurious garments, the most expensive foods, the rarest drinks, that largest number of servants and they applied this standard of lavishness to their dress as well</span>

				<span class='text'>54&lt;/ref&gt; Clothing soon became the chosen means in Court by which to display wealth and social standing</span>
				<span class='text'>Elizabeth is reported to have owned 15,000 dresses, several thousand pairs of shoes, and a seemingly unlimited number of stockings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Russian Tsars' p</span>
				<span class='text'>07&quot;/&gt; She was known to never wear a dress twice and to change outfits anywhere from two to six times a day</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the Empress did this, her courtiers did as well</span>
				<span class='text'>It is reported that to ensure no one wore a dress more than once to any ball or notably formal occasion, the Empress had her guards stamp each gown with special ink</span>

				<span class='text'>59&lt;/ref&gt; Men at court were known to wear diamond buttons, own jeweled snuff boxes, and adorn their servants in uniforms made of gold</span>
				<span class='text'>It was also during her reign that a great number of silver and gold objects were produced, the most the country had seen thus far in its history</span>

				<span class='text'>Äù, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>164&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth‚Äôs extravagance was also clearly displayed in the foods eaten at Court</span>
				<span class='text'>It was not unheard of for Elizabeth to order over a thousand bottles of French champagnes and wines at any given time to be served at one event and present pineapple at all of her receptions, despite the difficulty of procuring the fruit in such quantities</span>

				<span class='text'>Needing goods shipped from all over, the postal system and roads were modernized in order to fulfill the Empress‚Äôs many desires</span>

				<span class='text'>Äù, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>148&lt;/ref&gt;Elizabeth‚Äôs vanity and the attention paid to her personal appearance also had indelible ramifications on Court life</span>
				<span class='text'>Elizabeth as a young woman had been incredibly attractive, and in turn she desired to be the most attractive amongst any company at all times</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to ensure this was the case, Elizabeth passed various decrees outlining what was acceptable of her courtiers in regards to appearance in relation to the Empress</span>
				<span class='text'>These edicts included a law against wearing the same hairstyle, dress, or accessory as the Empress</span>
				<span class='text'>One woman, Natalya Lopukhina, accidentally wore the same item as the Empress and was lashed across the face for her offense</span>

				<span class='text'>59&lt;/ref&gt; Another law created by Elizabeth was that any French fabric salesman had to first sell to her before attempting to sell to anyone else; those who disregarded this law were arrested</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;k&quot;/&gt; One famous story exemplifying the Empress‚Äôs vanity is that, once, Elizabeth got a bit of powder in her hair and was unable to remove it</span>
				<span class='text'>She was therefore obligated to cut her hair to rid herself of the splotch and in turn she made all of the ladies at Court do the same, which they did ‚Äúwith tears in their eyes</span>

				<span class='text'>24&lt;/ref&gt; This aggressive vanity became a tenet of Elizabeth‚Äôs Court throughout the entirety of her reign, particularly as she grew older</span>
				<span class='text'> According to the historian [[Tamara Talbot Rice]], ‚ÄúLater in life her outbursts of anger were directed either against people who were thought to have endangered Russia‚Äôs security or against women whose beauty rivaled her own</span>

				<span class='text'>Elizabeth was renowned throughout and beyond Russia for the balls she held and her fierce commitment to the arts, particularly music, theater, and architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>It is reported that Elizabeth threw two balls a week</span>
				<span class='text'>One would be a large event with an average of 800 guests in attendance, most of whom were the nation‚Äôs leading merchants, members of the lower nobility, and guards stationed in and around the city of the event</span>

				<span class='text'>136&lt;/ref&gt; At these Metamorphoses balls, guests were expected to dress as the opposite sex, with Elizabeth often dressing up as Cossack or carpenter in honor of her father</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;q&quot;/&gt; The costumes not permitted at the event were those of pilgrims and harlequins, which the Empress considered profane and indecent respectively</span>

				<span class='text'>154&lt;/ref&gt; Most members of court thoroughly disliked these balls since most looked ridiculous but Elizabeth adored them</span>
				<span class='text'>As Catherine the Great‚Äôs advisor Potemkin posited, this adoration was due to the fact that she was ‚Äúthe only woman who looked truly fine, and completely a man‚Ä¶ As she was tall and powerful, male attire suited her</span>

				<span class='text'>138&lt;/ref&gt;The other court pastimes most enjoyed by Elizabeth and therefore most revered in Court were theatre, music, and architecture</span>
				<span class='text'>The Empress had a longstanding love of theatre and had a stage erected in the palace to enjoy the countless performances she sanctioned</span>
				<span class='text'>Though countless domestic and foreign works were shown, the French plays quickly became the most popular, often being performed twice a week</span>

				<span class='text'>160&lt;/ref&gt; Many attribute its popularity to Elizabeth‚Äôs relationship with [[Alexei Razumovsky]], a Ukrainian Cossack and the supposed husband of the Empress, who reportedly relished music</span>
				<span class='text'>Regardless of the reasoning behind its introduction, Elizabeth transformed ‚Äúher court into the country‚Äôs leading musical center</span>
