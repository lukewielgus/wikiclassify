				<span class='text'>He attended [[Friedrich Fröbel|Froebel]]ian Kindergarten</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Spending much of his youth on Bear Island, in [[Penobscot Bay]] off the coast of Maine, he had trouble with [[geometry]], being unable to understand the abstraction necessary to imagine that a chalk dot on the blackboard represented a mathematical [[Point (geometry)|point]], or that an imperfectly drawn line with an arrow on the end was meant to stretch off to [[infinity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He often made items from materials he brought home from the woods, and sometimes made his own tools</span>
				<span class='text'>He experimented with designing a new apparatus for human propulsion of small boats</span>
				<span class='text'>By the age of 12 he had &quot;invented&quot; a 'push pull' system for propelling a row boat through the use of an inverted umbrella connected to the transom with a simple oar lock which allowed the user to face forward to point the boat toward its destination</span>
				<span class='text'>Later in life Fuller took exception to the term &quot;invention&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>ears later, he decided that this sort of experience had provided him with not only an interest in design, but also a habit of being familiar with and knowledgeable about the materials that his later projects would require</span>
				<span class='text'>Fuller earned a [[machinist]]'s certification, and knew how to use the [[press brake]], stretch press, and other tools and equipment used in the [[sheet metal]] trade</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|A Dymaxion house at [[The Henry Ford]]]]Fuller's energy-efficient and inexpensive [[Dymaxion house]] garnered much interest, but has never been produced</span>
				<span class='text'>Here the term &quot;Dymaxion&quot; is used in effect to signify a &quot;radically strong and light tensegrity structure&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>One of Fuller's Dymaxion Houses is on display as a permanent exhibit at The Henry Ford in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Designed and developed during the mid-1940s, this prototype is a round structure (not a dome), shaped something like the flattened &quot;bell&quot; of certain jellyfish</span>
				<span class='text'>It has several innovative features, including revolving dresser drawers, and a fine-mist shower that reduces water consumption</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Fuller biographer Steve Crooks, the house was designed to be delivered in two cylindrical packages, with interior color panels available at local dealers</span>
				<span class='text'>A circular structure at the top of the house was designed to rotate around a central mast to use natural winds for cooling and air circulation</span>
				<span class='text'>onceived nearly two decades before, and developed in [[Wichita, Kansas]], the house was designed to be lightweight and adapted to windy climates</span>
				<span class='text'>It was to be inexpensive to produce and purchase, and assembled easily</span>
				<span class='text'>It was to be produced using factories, workers, and technologies that had produced World War II aircraft</span>
				<span class='text'>It was ultramodern-looking at the time, built of metal, and sheathed in polished aluminum</span>
				<span class='text'>The basic model enclosed {{convert|90|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} of floor area</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to publicity, there were many orders during the early Post-War years, but the company that Fuller and others had formed to produce the houses failed due to management problems</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1967 he developed a concept for an offshore floating city named [[Triton City]] and published a report on the design the following year</span>

				<span class='text'>The project developed and demonstrated concrete spray technology used in conjunction with mesh covered wireforms as a viable means of producing large scale, load bearing spanning structures built on site without the use of pouring molds, other adjacent surfaces or hoisting</span>
				<span class='text'>he initial construction method used a circular concrete footing in which anchor posts were set</span>
				<span class='text'>Tubes cut to length and with ends flattened were then bolted together to form a duodeca-rhombicahedron (22-sided hemisphere) geodesic structure with spans ranging to {{convert|60|ft|m}}</span>
				<span class='text'>The form was then draped with layers of ¼-inch wire mesh attached by twist ties</span>
				<span class='text'>Concrete was then sprayed onto the structure, building up a solid layer which, when cured, would support additional concrete to be added by a variety of traditional means</span>
				<span class='text'>Fuller referred to these buildings as monolithic ferroconcrete geodesic domes</span>
				<span class='text'>The tubular frame form proved too problematic when it came to setting windows and doors, and was abandoned</span>
				<span class='text'>The second method used iron [[rebar]] set vertically in the concrete footing and then bent inward and welded in place to create the dome's wireform structure and performed satisfactorily</span>
				<span class='text'>Domes up to three stories tall built with this method proved to be remarkably strong</span>
				<span class='text'>Other shapes such as cones, pyramids and arches proved equally adaptable</span>
				<span class='text'>he project was enabled by a grant underwritten by [[Syracuse University]] and sponsored by [[US Steel]] (rebar), the Johnson Wire Corp, (mesh) and Portland Cement Company (concrete)</span>
				<span class='text'>The ability to build large complex load bearing concrete spanning structures in free space would open many possibilities in architecture, and is considered as one of Fuller's greatest contributions</span>
				<span class='text'>==Dymaxion map and World Game===Fuller also designed an alternative projection map, called the [[Dymaxion map]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This was designed to show Earth's continents with minimum distortion when projected or printed on a flat surface</span>

				<span class='text'>B</span>
				<span class='text'>Fuller, Buckminster Fuller, but as an adult finally settled on R</span>
				<span class='text'>Buckminster Fuller, and signed his letters as such</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he preferred to be addressed as simply &quot;Bucky&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>=Language and neologisms==Buckminster Fuller spoke and wrote in a unique style and said it was important to describe the world as accurately as possible</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;What is important in this connection is the way in which humans reflex spontaneously for that is the way in which they usually behave in critical moments, and it is often &quot;common sense&quot; to reflex in perversely ignorant ways that produce social disasters by denying knowledge and ignorantly yielding to common sense</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Intuition, 1972 Doubleday, New York</span>
				<span class='text'>p</span>
				<span class='text'>03&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller often created long run-on sentences and used unusual compound words (omniwell-informed, intertransformative, omni-interaccommodative, omniself-regenerative) as well as terms he himself invented</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;He wrote a single unpunctuated sentence approximately 3000 words long titled &quot;What I Am Trying to Do</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; And It Came to Pass – Not to Stay Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1976</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Fuller used the word ''Universe'' without the [[definite article|definite]] or [[indefinite article]]s (''the'' or ''a'') and always capitalized the word</span>
				<span class='text'>Fuller wrote that &quot;by Universe I mean: the aggregate of all humanity's consciously apprehended and communicated (to self or others) Experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;How Little I Know&quot; from And It Came to Pass – Not to Stay Macmillan, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;The words &quot;down&quot; and &quot;up&quot;, according to Fuller, are awkward in that they refer to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience</span>
				<span class='text'>The words &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; should be used instead, he argued, because they better describe an object's relation to a gravitational center, the Earth</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I suggest to audiences that they say, 'I'm going &quot;outstairs&quot; and &quot;instairs</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;' At first that sounds strange to them; They all laugh about it</span>
				<span class='text'>But if they try saying in and out for a few days in fun, they find themselves beginning to realize that they are indeed going inward and outward in respect to the center of Earth, which is our Spaceship Earth</span>
				<span class='text'>And for the first time they begin to feel real 'reality</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Intuition'' (1972)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&quot;World-around&quot; is a term coined by Fuller to replace &quot;worldwide&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The general belief in a [[flat Earth]] died out in [[classical antiquity]], so using &quot;wide&quot; is an anachronism when referring to the surface of the Earth—a spheroidal surface has area and encloses a volume but has no width</span>
				<span class='text'>Fuller held that unthinking use of obsolete scientific ideas detracts from and misleads intuition</span>
				<span class='text'>Other neologisms collectively invented by the Fuller family, according to Allegra Fuller Snyder, are the terms &quot;sunsight&quot; and &quot;sunclipse&quot;, replacing &quot;sunrise&quot; and &quot;sunset&quot; to overturn the geocentric bias of most pre-[[Nicolaus Copernicus|copernican]] [[celestial mechanics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>uller also invented the word &quot;livingry,&quot; as opposed to weaponry (or &quot;killingry&quot;), to mean that which is in support of all human, plant, and Earth life</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The architectural profession—civil, naval, aeronautical, and astronautical—has always been the place where the most competent thinking is conducted regarding livingry, as opposed to weaponry</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Critical Path'', page xxv</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;As well as contributing significantly to the development of tensegrity technology, Fuller invented the term &quot;[[tensegrity]]&quot; from ''tensional integrity''</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Tensegrity describes a structural-relationship principle in which structural shape is guaranteed by the finitely closed, comprehensively continuous, tensional behaviors of the system and not by the discontinuous and exclusively local compressional member behaviors</span>
				<span class='text'>Tensegrity provides the ability to yield increasingly without ultimately breaking or coming asunder</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Synergetics'', page 372</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&quot;[[Dymaxion]]&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;dynamic maximum tension&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It was invented about 1929 by two [[Advertising agency|admen]] at Marshall Field's department store in Chicago to describe Fuller's concept house, which was shown as part of a house of the future store display</span>
				<span class='text'>They created the term utilizing three words that Fuller used repeatedly to describe his design – dynamic, maximum, and ion</span>
