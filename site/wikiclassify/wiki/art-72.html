				<span class='text'>He often made items from materials he brought home from the woods and sometimes made his own tools</span>
				<span class='text'>He experimented with designing a new apparatus for human propulsion of small boats</span>
				<span class='text'>By the age of 12 he had invented a push pull system for propelling a row boat through the use of an inverted umbrella connected to the transom with a simple oar lock which allowed the user to face forward to point the boat toward its destination</span>
				<span class='text'>Later in life Fuller took exception to the term invention</span>
				<span class='text'>ears later he decided that this sort of experience had provided him with not only an interest in design but also a habit of being familiar with and knowledgeable about the materials that his later projects would require</span>
				<span class='text'>Fuller earned a s certification and knew how to use the  stretch press and other tools and equipment used in the  trade</span>

				<span class='text'>Buckminster Fuller was also Unitarian</span>
				<span class='text'> Buckminster Fuller was an early </span>
				<span class='text'>He was very aware of the finite resources the planet has to offer and promoted a principle that he termed  which in essence‚Äîaccording to futurist and Fuller disciple ‚ÄîFuller coined to mean doing more with less</span>
				<span class='text'> Resources and waste material from cruder products could be recycled into making more valuable products increasing the efficiency of the entire process</span>
				<span class='text'>Fuller also introduced  an encompassing term which he used broadly as a metaphoric language for communicating experiences using geometric concepts and more specifically to erence the empirical study of systems in transformation with an emphasis on total system behavior unpredicted by the behavior of any isolated components</span>
				<span class='text'>Fuller coined this term long before the term  became popular</span>
				<span class='text'>uller was a pioneer in thinking globally and he explored principles of  and  in the fields of architecture engineering and design</span>
				<span class='text'>  He cited Fran√ßois de Chardenedes opinion that petroleum from the standpoint of its replacement cost out of our current energy budget essentially the net incoming  had cost nature over a million dollars per U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>gallon US300000 per litre to produce</span>
				<span class='text'>From this point of view its use as a transportation fuel by people commuting to work represents a huge net loss compared to their earnings</span>
				<span class='text'> An encapsulation quotation of his views might be There is no energy crisis only a crisis of ignorance</span>
				<span class='text'>  Fuller was concerned about  and about human survival under the existing socio economic system yet remained optimistic about humanitys future</span>
				<span class='text'>Defining wealth in terms of knowledge as the technological ability to protect nurture support and accommodate all growth needs of life his analysis of the condition of Spaceship Earth caused him to conclude that at a certain time during the 1970s humanity had attained an unprecedented state</span>
				<span class='text'>He was convinced that the accumulation of relevant knowledge combined with the quantities of major recyclable resources that had already been extracted from the earth had attained a critical level such that competition for necessities was not necessary anymore</span>
				<span class='text'>Cooperation had become the optimum survival strategy</span>
				<span class='text'>Selfishness he declared is unnecessary and hence forth unrationalizable</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> War is obsolete</span>
				<span class='text'> He criticized previous utopian schemes as too exclusive and thought this was a major source of their failure</span>
				<span class='text'>To work he thought that a utopia needed to include everyone</span>
				<span class='text'>So it is not surprising that he and others of his stature were attracted by s ideas in </span>
				<span class='text'>General semantics is a discipline of mind that seeks to unify persons and nations by changing their worldview reaction and the philosophy of their expression</span>

				<span class='text'>The two gentlemen shared a remarkable amount of similarity in their formulations of general semantics</span>

				<span class='text'>uller wrote that the natural  of the universe was based on arrays of tetrahedra</span>
				<span class='text'>He developed this in several ways from the close packing of spheres and the number of compressive or tensile members required to stabilize an object in space</span>
				<span class='text'>One confirming result was that the strongest possible homogeneous  is cyclically tetrahedral</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>2682235 awarded in 1954 follows the same design as Bauersfelds</span>
				<span class='text'>Their construction is based on extending some basic principles to build simple  structures tetrahedron  and the closest packing of spheres making them lightweight and stable</span>
				<span class='text'>The geodesic dome was a result of Fullers exploration of natures constructing principles to find design solutions</span>
				<span class='text'>The Fuller Dome is erenced in the  winning novel  by  in which a geodesic dome is said to cover the entire island of  and it floats on air due to the hot air balloon effect of the large air mass under the dome and perhaps its construction of lightweight materials</span>
				<span class='text'>The  was a vehicle designed by Fuller featured prominently at Chicagos 1933 1934  Worlds Fair</span>
				<span class='text'> During the  Fuller formed the Dymaxion Corporation and built three prototypes with noted naval architect  and a team of 27 workmen ampmdash using gifted money as well as a family inheritance</span>
				<span class='text'>name biography  name nyt06 Fuller associated the word Dymaxion with much of his work a  of the words dynamic maximum and tension  to sum up the goal of his study maximum gain of advantage from minimal energy input</span>
				<span class='text'>The Dymaxion was not an automobile per se but rather the ground taxying mode of a vehicle that might one day be designed to fly land and drive ampmdash an Omni Medium Transport for air land and water</span>
				<span class='text'>name Marks 1973 104   Fuller focused on the landing and taxiing qualities and noted severe limitations in its handling</span>
				<span class='text'> The team made constant improvements and inements to the platform name universe  and Fuller noted the Dymaxion was an invention that could not be made available to the general public without considerable improvements</span>
				<span class='text'>name universe The bodywork was aerodynamically designed for increased fuel efficiency and speed as well as light weight and its  featured a lightweight cromoly steel hinged chassis rear mounted V8 engine front drive and three wheels</span>
				<span class='text'>The vehicle was steered via the third wheel at the rear capable of 90¬∞ </span>
				<span class='text'>Thus able to steer in a tight circle the Dymaxion often caused a sensation  bringing nearby traffic to a halt</span>

				<span class='text'>name accident   The other car was driven by a local politician and was illegally removed from the accident scene leaving reporters who arrived subsequently to blame the Dymaxions unconventional design name carandriver  ampmdash though investigations exonerated the prototype</span>
				<span class='text'>name accident  Fuller would himself later crash another prototype with his young daughter aboard</span>
				<span class='text'>espite courting the interest of important figures from the auto industry Fuller used his family inheritance to finish the second and third prototypes name transverse  ampmdash eventually selling all three dissolving Dymaxion Corporation and maintaining the Dymaxion was never intended as a commercial venture</span>

				<span class='text'>Here the term Dymaxion is used in effect to signify a radically strong and light tensegrity structure</span>
				<span class='text'>One of Fullers Dymaxion Houses is on display as a permanent exhibit at The Henry Ford in </span>
				<span class='text'>Designed and developed during the mid 1940s this prototype is a round structure not a dome shaped something like the flattened bell of certain jellyfish</span>
				<span class='text'>It has several innovative features including revolving dresser drawers and a fine mist shower that reduces water consumption</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Fuller biographer Steve Crooks the house was designed to be delivered in two cylindrical packages with interior color panels available at local dealers</span>
				<span class='text'>A circular structure at the top of the house was designed to rotate around a central mast to use natural winds for cooling and air circulation</span>
				<span class='text'>onceived nearly two decades before and developed in  the house was designed to be lightweight and adapted to windy climates</span>
				<span class='text'>It was to be inexpensive to produce and purchase and assembled easily</span>
				<span class='text'>It was to be produced using factories workers and technologies that had produced World War II aircraft</span>
				<span class='text'>It was ultramodern looking at the time built of metal and sheathed in polished aluminum</span>
				<span class='text'>The basic model enclosed  of floor area</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to publicity there were many orders during the early Post War years but the company that Fuller and others had formed to produce the houses failed due to management problems</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1967 he developed a concept for an offshore floating city named  and published a report on the design the following year</span>
				<span class='text'> Models of the city aroused the interest of President  who after leaving office had them placed in the </span>
				<span class='text'>In 1969 Fuller began the Otisco Project named after its location in </span>
				<span class='text'>The project developed and demonstrated concrete spray technology used in conjunction with mesh covered wiorms as a viable means of producing large scale load bearing spanning structures built on site without the use of pouring molds other adjacent surfaces or hoisting</span>
				<span class='text'>he initial construction method used a circular concrete footing in which anchor posts were set</span>
				<span class='text'>Tubes cut to length and with ends flattened were then bolted together to form a duodeca rhombicahedron 22 sided hemisphere geodesic structure with spans ranging to </span>
				<span class='text'>The form was then draped with layers of ¬º inch wire mesh attached by twist ties</span>
				<span class='text'>Concrete was then sprayed onto the structure building up a solid layer which when cured would support additional concrete to be added by a variety of traditional means</span>
				<span class='text'>Fuller erred to these buildings as monolithic ferroconcrete geodesic domes</span>
				<span class='text'>The tubular frame form proved too problematic when it came to setting windows and doors and was abandoned</span>
				<span class='text'>The second method used iron  set vertically in the concrete footing and then bent inward and welded in place to create the domes wiorm structure and performed satisfactorily</span>
				<span class='text'>Domes up to three stories tall built with this method proved to be remarkably strong</span>
				<span class='text'>Other shapes such as cones pyramids and arches proved equally adaptable</span>
				<span class='text'>he project was enabled by a grant underwritten by  and sponsored by  rebar the Johnson Wire Corp mesh and Portland Cement Company concrete</span>
				<span class='text'>The ability to build large complex load bearing concrete spanning structures in free space would open many possibilities in architecture and is considered as one of Fullers greatest contributions</span>
				<span class='text'>uller also designed an alternative projection map called the </span>
				<span class='text'>This was designed to show Earths continents with minimum distortion when projected or printed on a flat surface</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1960s Fuller developed the  a collaborative simulation game played on a 70 by 35 foot Dymaxion map  in which players attempt to solve world problems</span>
				<span class='text'>  The object of the simulation game is in Fullers words to ‚Äúmake the world work for 100% of humanity in the shortest possible time through spontaneous cooperation without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone</span>

				<span class='text'>anguage and neologismsBuckminster Fuller spoke and wrote in a unique style and said it was important to describe the world as accurately as possible</span>
				<span class='text'>hat is important in this connection is the way in which humans lex spontaneously for that is the way in which they usually behave in critical moments and it is often common sense to lex in perversely ignorant ways that produce social disasters by denying knowledge and ignorantly yielding to common sense</span>

				<span class='text'>03  Fuller often created long run on sentences and used unusual compound words omniwell informed intertransformative omni interaccommodative omniself regenerative as well as terms he himself invented</span>
				<span class='text'>e wrote a single unpunctuated sentence approximately 3000 words long titled What I Am Trying to Do</span>
				<span class='text'>And It Came to Pass ‚Äì Not to Stay Macmillan Publishing New York 1976</span>
				<span class='text'>Fuller used the word Universe without the  or s the or a and always capitalized the word</span>
				<span class='text'>Fuller wrote that by Universe I mean the aggregate of all humanitys consciously apprehended and communicated to self or others Experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>ow Little I Know from And It Came to Pass ‚Äì Not to Stay Macmillan 1976 The words down and up according to Fuller are awkward in that they er to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience</span>
				<span class='text'>The words in and out should be used instead he argued because they better describe an objects relation to a gravitational center the Earth</span>
				<span class='text'>I suggest to audiences that they say Im going outstairs and instairs</span>
				<span class='text'>At first that sounds strange to them They all laugh about it</span>
				<span class='text'>But if they try saying in and out for a few days in fun they find themselves beginning to realize that they are indeed going inward and outward in respect to the center of Earth which is our Spaceship Earth</span>
				<span class='text'>And for the first time they begin to feel real reality</span>

				<span class='text'>World around is a term coined by Fuller to replace worldwide</span>
				<span class='text'>The general belief in a  died out in  so using wide is an anachronism when erring to the surface of the Earth‚Äîa spheroidal surface has area and encloses a volume but has no width</span>
				<span class='text'>Fuller held that unthinking use of obsolete scientific ideas detracts from and misleads intuition</span>
				<span class='text'>Other neologisms collectively invented by the Fuller family according to Allegra Fuller Snyder are the terms sunsight and sunclipse replacing sunrise and sunset to overturn the geocentric bias of most pre  </span>
				<span class='text'>uller also invented the word livingry as opposed to weaponry or killingry to mean that which is in support of all human plant and Earth life</span>
				<span class='text'>The architectural profession‚Äîcivil naval aeronautical and astronautical‚Äîhas always been the place where the most competent thinking is conducted regarding livingry as opposed to weaponry</span>

				<span class='text'>As well as contributing significantly to the development of tensegrity technology Fuller invented the term  from tensional integrity</span>
				<span class='text'>Tensegrity describes a structural relationship principle in which structural shape is guaranteed by the finitely closed comprehensively continuous tensional behaviors of the system and not by the discontinuous and exclusively local compressional member behaviors</span>
				<span class='text'>Tensegrity provides the ability to yield increasingly without ultimately breaking or coming asunder</span>
