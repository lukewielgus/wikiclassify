				<span class='text'>One of Mill's earliest poetry compositions was a continuation of the [[Iliad]]</span>

				<span class='text'>=Works=====Theory of liberty==={{Main|On Liberty}}Mill's ''[[On Liberty]]'' addresses the nature and limits of the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] that can be legitimately exercised by society over the [[individual]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However Mill is clear that his concern for liberty does not extend to all individuals and all societies</span>
				<span class='text'>He states that &quot;Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>tm ''On Liberty'', by John Stuart Mill, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>18–19</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;Mill states that it is acceptable to harm oneself as long as the person doing so is not harming others</span>
				<span class='text'>He also argues that individuals should be prevented from doing lasting, serious harm to themselves or their property by the [[harm principle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Because no one exists in isolation, harm done to oneself may also harm others, and destroying property deprives the community as well as oneself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart &quot;On Liberty&quot; Penguin Classics, 2006 ISBN 978-0-14-144147-4 pages 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; Mill excuses those who are &quot;incapable of [[self-government]]&quot; from this principle, such as young children or those living in &quot;backward states of society&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>hough this principle seems clear, there are a number of complications</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, Mill explicitly states that &quot;harms&quot; may include acts of omission as well as acts of commission</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, failing to rescue a [[drowning]] child counts as a harmful act, as does failing to pay [[taxes]], or failing to appear as a [[witness]] in court</span>
				<span class='text'>All such harmful omissions may be regulated, according to Mill</span>
				<span class='text'>By contrast, it does not count as harming someone if – without force or fraud – the affected individual consents to assume the risk: thus one may permissibly offer unsafe employment to others, provided there is no deception involved</span>
				<span class='text'>(Mill does, however, recognise one limit to consent: society should not permit people to [[Voluntary slavery|sell themselves into slavery]])</span>
				<span class='text'>In these and other cases, it is important to bear in mind that the arguments in ''On Liberty'' are grounded on the principle of Utility, and not on appeals to [[natural rights]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he question of what counts as a self-regarding action and what actions, whether of omission or commission, constitute harmful actions subject to regulation, continues to exercise interpreters of Mill</span>
				<span class='text'>It is important to emphasise that Mill did not consider giving offence to constitute &quot;harm&quot;; an action could not be restricted because it violated the conventions or morals of a given society</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[On Liberty]]'' involves an impassioned defence of free speech</span>
				<span class='text'>Mill argues that free [[discourse]] is a [[necessary condition]] for intellectual and social progress</span>
				<span class='text'>We can never be sure, he contends, that a silenced opinion does not contain some element of the truth</span>
				<span class='text'>He also argues that allowing people to air false opinions is productive for two reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>First, individuals are more likely to abandon erroneous beliefs if they are engaged in an open exchange of ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>Second, by forcing other individuals to re-examine and re-affirm their beliefs in the process of debate, these beliefs are kept from declining into mere [[dogma]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not enough for Mill that one simply has an unexamined belief that happens to be true; one must understand why the belief in question is the true one</span>
				<span class='text'> Along those same lines Mill wrote, &quot;unmeasured vituperation, employed on the side of prevailing opinion, really does deter people from expressing contrary opinions, and from listening to those who express them</span>

				<span class='text'>]====Social liberty and tyranny of majority===={{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}Mill believed that &quot;the struggle between [[Liberty]] and [[Authority]] is the most conspicuous feature in the portions of history</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; For him, liberty in antiquity was a &quot;contest</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>between subjects, or some classes of subjects, and the government</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Mill defined &quot;[[social liberty]]&quot; as protection from &quot;the tyranny of political rulers</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He introduced a number of different concepts of the form tyranny can take, referred to as social tyranny, and [[tyranny of the majority]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[Social liberty]] for Mill meant putting limits on the ruler's power so that he would not be able to use his power on his own wishes and make decisions which could harm society; in other words, people should have the right to have a say in the government's decisions</span>
				<span class='text'>He said that [[social liberty]] was &quot;the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It was attempted in two ways: first, by obtaining recognition of certain immunities, called political liberties or rights; second, by establishment of a system of &quot;[[constitutional]] checks&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, in Mill's view, limiting the power of government was not enough</span>
				<span class='text'>He stated, &quot;Society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with which it ought not to meddle, it practices a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself</span>

				<span class='text'>10–11&lt;/ref&gt;====Liberty====John Stuart Mill's view on [[liberty]], which was influenced by [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Josiah Warren]], is that the [[individual]] ought to be free to do as he wishes unless he harms others</span>
				<span class='text'>Individuals are rational enough to make decisions about their well being</span>
				<span class='text'>Government should interfere when it is for the protection of society</span>
				<span class='text'>Mill explained:&lt;blockquote&gt;The sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection</span>
				<span class='text'>That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others</span>
				<span class='text'>His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant</span>

				<span class='text'>He says:&lt;blockquote&gt;I choose, by preference the cases which are least favourable to me – In which the argument opposing freedom of opinion, both on truth and that of [[utility]], is considered the strongest</span>
				<span class='text'>Let the opinions impugned be the belief of God and in a future state, or any of the commonly received doctrines of morality</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>But I must be permitted to observe that it is not the feeling sure of a doctrine (be it what it may) which I call an assumption of [[infallibility]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is the undertaking to decide that question ''for others'', without allowing them to hear what can be said on the contrary side</span>
				<span class='text'>And I denounce and reprobate this pretension not the less if it is put forth on the side of my most solemn convictions</span>
				<span class='text'>However, positive anyone's persuasion may be, not only of the faculty but of the pernicious consequences, but (to adopt expressions which I altogether condemn) the immorality and impiety of opinion</span>
				<span class='text'>– yet if, in pursuance of that private judgement, though backed by the public judgement of his country or contemporaries, he prevents the opinion from being heard in its defence, he assumes infallibility</span>
				<span class='text'>And so far from the assumption being less objectionable or less dangerous because the opinion is called immoral or impious, this is the case of all others in which it is most fatal</span>

				<span class='text'>'  This philosophy has a long tradition, although Mill's account is primarily influenced by [[Jeremy Bentham]] and Mill's father [[James Mill]]</span>
				<span class='text'>eremy Bentham's famous formulation of utilitarianism is known as the &quot;greatest-happiness principle&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It holds that one must always act so as to produce the greatest aggregate happiness among all sentient beings, within reason</span>
				<span class='text'>Mill's major contribution to utilitarianism is his argument for the qualitative separation of pleasures</span>
				<span class='text'>Bentham treats all forms of happiness as equal, whereas Mill argues that intellectual and moral pleasures (higher pleasures) are superior to more physical forms of pleasure (lower pleasures)</span>
				<span class='text'>Mill distinguishes between happiness and contentment, claiming that the former is of higher value than the latter, a belief wittily encapsulated in the statement that &quot;it is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be [[Socrates]] dissatisfied than a fool satisfied</span>
				<span class='text'>And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question</span>

				<span class='text'>Mill's argument is that the &quot;simple pleasures&quot; tend to be preferred by people who have no experience with high art, and are therefore not in a proper position to [[Informed judge|judge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Mill also argues that people who, for example, are noble or practice philosophy, benefit society more than those who engage in individualist practices for pleasure, which are lower forms of happiness</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If the earth must lose that great portion of its pleasantness which it owes to things that the unlimited increase of wealth and population would extirpate from it, for the mere purpose of enabling it to support a larger, but not a better or a happier population, I sincerely hope, for the sake of posterity, that they will be content to be stationary, long before necessity compel them to it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;====Economic development===={{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}Mill regarded economic development as a function of land, labour and capital</span>
				<span class='text'>While land and labour are the two original factors of production, capital is &quot;a stock, previously accumulated of the products of former labour</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Increase in wealth is possible only if land and capital help to increase production faster than the labour force</span>
				<span class='text'>It is productive labour that is productive of wealth and capital accumulation</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The rate of capital accumulation is the function of the proportion of the labour force employed ' productively</span>

				<span class='text'>It is productive labourers who do productive consumption</span>
				<span class='text'>Productive consumption is that &quot;which maintains and increase the productive capacity of the community</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; It implies that productive consumption is an input necessary to maintain productive labourers</span>

				<span class='text'>Wages generally exceed the minimum subsistence level, and are paid out of capital</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence, wages are limited by existing capital for paying wages</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, wage per worker can be derived by dividing the total circulating capital by the size of the working population</span>
				<span class='text'>Wages can increase by an increase in the capital used in paying wages, or by decrease in the number of workers</span>
				<span class='text'>If wages rise, supply of labour will rise</span>
				<span class='text'>Competition among workers not only brings down wages, but also keeps some workers out of employment</span>
				<span class='text'>This is based on Mill's notion that &quot;demand for commodities is not demand for labourers&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It means that income invested as advances of wages to labour creates employment, and not income spent on consumer goods</span>
				<span class='text'>An increase in consumption causes a decline in investment</span>
				<span class='text'>So increased investment leads to increases in the wage fund and to economic progress</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1869, Mill recanted his support of the Wage-Fund Doctrine due to recognition that capital is not necessarily fixed in that it can be supplemented through “income of the employer which might otherwise go into savings or be spent on consumption</span>
				<span class='text'> (Spiegel{{who|date=November 2015}}, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;390) Walker{{who|date=November 2015}} also states in “The Wages Question” that the limits on capital and the growth in population “were accidental, not essential” to the formation of the doctrine</span>
				<span class='text'>The limitation on the growth of industrial capacity placed a limit on the number of workers who could be accommodated more than the limit on capital</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, English agriculture “had reached the condition of diminishing returns</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (Walker); therefore, each additional worker was not providing more output than he needed for himself for survival</span>
				<span class='text'>Given the improvements in technology and productivity that followed 1848, the original reasons that gave rise to the doctrine were seen to be unusual and not the basis for a universal law</span>
				<span class='text'>===Rate of capital accumulation===={{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}According to Mill, the rate of capital accumulation depends on: (1) &quot;the amount of fund from which saving can be made&quot; or &quot;the size of the net produce of the industry&quot;, and (2) the &quot;disposition to save&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Capital is the result of savings, and the savings come from the &quot;abstinence from present consumption for the sake of future goods&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Although capital is the result of saving, it is nevertheless consumed</span>
				<span class='text'>This means saving is spending</span>
				<span class='text'>Since saving depends on the net produce of the industry, it grows with profits and rent which go into making the net produce</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, the disposition to save depends on (1) the rate of profit and (2) the desire to save, or what Mill called &quot;effective desire of accumulation&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>However, profit also depends on the cost of labour, and the rate of profit is the ratio of profits to wages</span>
				<span class='text'>When profits rise or wages fall, the rate of profits increases, which in turn increases the rate of capital accumulation</span>
				<span class='text'>Similarly, it is the desire to save which tends to increase the rate of capital accumulation</span>
				<span class='text'>===Rate of profit====According to Mill, the ultimate tendency in an economy is for the rate of profit to decline due to diminishing returns in agriculture and increase in population at a Malthusian rate</span>
