				<span class='text'>The title refers to a disputed [[hadith|Muslim tradition]] that is related in the book</span>
				<span class='text'>According to this tradition, Muhammad ([[Mahound]] in the book) added verses (''[[Ayah]]'') to the [[Qur'an]] accepting three goddesses who used to be worshipped in [[Mecca]] as divine beings</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the legend, Muhammad later revoked the verses, saying [[the devil]] tempted him to utter these lines to appease the Meccans (hence the &quot;Satanic&quot; verses)</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the narrator reveals to the reader that these disputed verses were actually from the mouth of the [[Gabriel|Archangel Gibreel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[banned books|book was banned]] in many countries with large Muslim communities</span>
				<span class='text'>(13 total: Iran, India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Thailand, Tanzania, Indonesia, Singapore, Venezuela, and Pakistan</span>
				<span class='text'>In response to the protests, on 22 January 1989 Rushdie published a column in ''[[The Observer]]'' that called Muhammad &quot;one of the great geniuses of world history,&quot; but noted that Islamic doctrine holds Muhammad to be human, and in no way perfect</span>
				<span class='text'>He held that the novel is not &quot;an anti-religious novel</span>
				<span class='text'>It is, however, an attempt to write about migration, its stresses and transformations</span>

				<span class='text'>A bounty was offered for Rushdie's death, and he was thus forced to live under police protection for several years</span>
				<span class='text'>On 7 March 1989, the United Kingdom and [[Iran]] broke [[Iran&amp;nbsp;– United Kingdom relations|diplomatic]] relations over the Rushdie controversy</span>

				<span class='text'>In 2010, U2 bassist [[Adam Clayton]] recalled that &quot;[lead vocalist] Bono had been calling Salman Rushdie from the stage every night on the Zoo TV tour</span>
