				<span class='text'>He and his friend [[Du Fu]] (712‚Äì770) were the two most prominent figures in the flourishing of [[Chinese poetry]] in the [[Tang Dynasty]] that is often called the &quot;[[Tang poetry#High Tang|Golden Age]] of China&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The expression &quot;Three Wonders&quot; referred to Li Bai‚Äôs poetry, Pei Min‚Äôs swordplay, and [[Zhang Xu]]‚Äôs calligraphy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[New Book of Tang|The New Book of Tang]] ÊñáÂÆóÊôÇÔºåË©î‰ª•ÁôΩÊ≠åË©©„ÄÅË£¥ÊóªÂäçËàû„ÄÅÂºµÊó≠ËçâÊõ∏ÁÇ∫„Äå‰∏âÁµï„Äç&lt;/ref&gt;Around a thousand poems attributed to him are extant</span>
				<span class='text'>His poems have been collected into four [[Tang dynasty]] poetry anthologies,&lt;ref&gt;Ê≤≥Â∂ΩËã±ÈùàÈõÜ, ÂîêÂØ´Êú¨Âîê‰∫∫ÈÅ∏ÂîêË©©, ÂèàÁéÑÈõÜ, and ÊâçË™øÈõÜ&lt;/ref&gt; and thirty-four of his poems are included in the anthology ''[[Three Hundred Tang Poems]]'', which was first published in the 18th century</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same century, translations of his poems began to appear in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>The poems were models for celebrating the pleasures of friendship, the depth of nature, solitude, and the joys of drinking wine</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the most famous are &quot;Waking from Drunkenness on a Spring Day&quot;, &quot;The Hard Road to Shu&quot;, and &quot;[[Quiet Night Thought]]&quot;, which still appear in school texts in China</span>
				<span class='text'>In the West, multi-lingual translations of Li's poems continue to be made</span>
				<span class='text'>His life has even taken on a legendary aspect, including tales of drunkenness, chivalry, and the well-known fable that Li drowned when he reached from his boat to grasp the moon‚Äôs reflection in the river</span>
				<span class='text'>uch of Li's life is reflected in his poetry: places which he visited, friends whom he saw off on journeys to distant locations perhaps never to meet again, his own dream-like imaginations embroidered with shamanic overtones, current events of which he had news of, descriptions sliced from nature in a timeless moment of poetry, and so on</span>
				<span class='text'>However, of particular importance are the changes in the times through which he lived</span>
				<span class='text'>His early poetry took place in the context of a &quot;golden age&quot; of internal peace and prosperity in the Chinese empire of the Tang dynasty, under the reign of an emperor who actively promoted and participated in the arts</span>
				<span class='text'>This all changed suddenly and shockingly, beginning with the rebellion of the general An Lushan, when all of northern China was devastated by war and famine</span>
				<span class='text'>Li's poetry as well takes on new tones and qualities</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike his younger friend Du Fu, Li was not to live to see the quelling of these disorders</span>
				<span class='text'>However, much of Li's poetry has survived and it has retained enduring popularity in China and elsewhere</span>

				<span class='text'>In Hanyu Pinyin, reflecting modern [[Mandarin Chinese]], the main, colloquial equivalent for this character is ''B√°i''; however ''B√≥'' is the correct [[Literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters|literary variant]] and a common pronunciation for his name</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;P&quot; in Wade‚ÄìGiles '''Po''' indicates a lack of aspiration in the consonant, thus closer to /b/ than /p/, which would be written &quot;p'&quot;, that is, /p/ followed by an apostrophe</span>
				<span class='text'>The Cantonese version is ''baak''6, with a final /k/</span>
				<span class='text'>The reconstructed version of how he and others during the Tang dynasty would have pronounced this is ''Bh√¶k''</span>
				<span class='text'>His [[courtesy name]] (''zi'') was '''Taibai''' ('''Tai-pai'''; Â§™ÁôΩ), literally &quot;Great White,&quot; literally meaning [[Mount Taibai#History|Venus]] (in the Chinese of the time: later the term &quot;Gold Star&quot; replaced &quot;Great White&quot; as the planetary name)</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, combining the family name with the courtesy name, his name appears in variants such as ''Li Taibo'', ''Li Taibai'', ''Li Tai-po'', and others</span>
				<span class='text'>ess commonly in English, he also may be known by the pseudonym (''[[Art name|hao]]''), ''Qƒ´ngli√°n J≈´sh√¨'' (''Ching-lien Chu-shih''; ÈùíËìÆ[[wikt:Â±ÖÂ£´|Â±ÖÂ£´]]), meaning literally ''[[Householder (Buddhism)|Householder]] of Azure Lotus'' (that is, Qianlian town), or the nicknames  &quot;Immortal Poet&quot; (Poet [[Xian (Taoism)|Transcendent]] )({{zh|t=Ë©©‰ªô|s=ËØó‰ªô|p=Shƒ´xiƒÅn|w=Shih&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-hsien&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}), Wine Immortal ({{zh|c=ÈÖí‰ªô|p=Ji«îxiƒÅn|w=Chiu&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-hsien&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}), Banished Transcendent ({{zh|t=Ë¨´‰ªô‰∫∫|p=Zh√©xiƒÅnr√©n|w=Che&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-hsien&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-jen&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}), Poet-[[Chinese knight-errant|Knight-errant]] ({{zh|t=Ë©©‰ø†|s=ËØó‰æ†|p=Shƒ´xi√°|w=Shih&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-hsia&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, or &quot;Poet-Hero&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>When the English transliteration is derived through Japanese, his name may be given as &quot;Ri Haku&quot;or &quot;Ri Taihaku&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>=Life==The two &quot;Books of Tang&quot;, [[Old Book of Tang|''The Old Book of Tang'']] and [[New Book of Tang|''The New Book of Tang'']], remain the primary sources of bibliographical material on Li Bai</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Obata, Part III&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources include internal evidence from poems by or about Li Bai, and certain other sources, such the preface to his collected poems by his relative and literary executor, Li Yangbin</span>
				<span class='text'>==Background and birth===Li Bai is generally considered to have been born in 701, in what is now Central Asia,&lt;ref name=&quot;Beckwith, 127&quot;&gt;Beckwith, 127&lt;/ref&gt; where his family had prospered in business at the frontier</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Sun, 20&quot;&gt;Sun, 20&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the family under the leadership of his father, Li Ke (ÊùéÂÆ¢), moved to [[Jiangyou]], near modern [[Chengdu]], in [[Sichuan]] province, when the youngster was perhaps five years old</span>
				<span class='text'>There is some mystery or uncertainty about the circumstances of the family relocations, at the very least a lack of legal authorization which would have generally been required to move out of the border regions, especially if one's family had been assigned (exiled) there</span>
				<span class='text'>However, despite much speculation, the facts are scant</span>
				<span class='text'>===Background====Two accounts given by contemporaries [[Li Yangbing]] (a family relative) and Fan Chuanzheng state that Li's family was originally from what is now southeastern [[Gansu]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Li's ancestry is traditionally traced back to [[Li Gao]], the noble founder of the state of [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Western Liang]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Obata, 8&lt;/ref&gt; This provides some support for Li's own claim to be related to the Li dynastic royal family of the Tang dynasty: the Tang emperors also claimed descent from the Li rulers of West Liang</span>
				<span class='text'>Evidence suggests that during the [[Sui Dynasty]], Li's own ancestors, at that time for some reason classified socially as commoners, were forced into a form of exile from their original home (in what is now Gansu) to some location or locations further west</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wu, 57-58&lt;/ref&gt; During their exile in the far west, the Li family lived in the ancient [[Silk Road]] city of Suiye ([[Suyab]], now an archeological site in present-day Kyrgyzstan, and perhaps also in Tiaozhi ({{zh|t=Ê¢ùÊûù|s=Êù°Êûù|p=Ti√°ozhƒ´}}), a state centered near modern [[Ghazni|Ghazni, Afghanistan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Elling Eide, &quot;On Li Po&quot;, ''Perspectives on the T'ang'' (New Haven, London: Yale University Press, 1973), 388</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  These areas were on the ancient [[Silk Road]], and the Li family were likely merchants</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Eide (1973), 389</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Their business was quite prosperous</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sun, 1982, 20 and 21&lt;/ref&gt;====Birth====In one [[hagiography|hagiographic]] account, while Li Bai's mother was pregnant with him, she had a dream of a great white star falling from heaven</span>
				<span class='text'>This seems to have contributed to the idea of his being a banished immortal (one of his nicknames)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wu, 59&quot;&gt;Wu, 59&lt;/ref&gt; That the Great White Star was synonymous with Venus helps to explain his courtesy name: &quot;Tai Bai&quot;, or &quot;Venus&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>==Marriage and family===Li is known to have married at least twice</span>
				<span class='text'>In 727, Li entered into his first marriage, to the granddaughter of an ex-government minister</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Sun, 20&quot;/&gt; Later on, in the year 744, Li married for the second time, in what now is [[Liangyuan District]] of [[Henan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This marriage was to another poet, surnamed [[Zong (surname)|Zong]] (ÂÆó), with whom he both had children&lt;ref&gt;Sun, 24, 25, and 166&lt;/ref&gt; and exchanges of poems, including many expressions of love for her and their children</span>
				<span class='text'>His wife, Zong, was a granddaughter of [[Zong Chuke]] (ÂÆóÊ•öÂÆ¢, died 710), an important government official during the Tang dynasty and the interegnal period of [[Wu Zetian]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Early years===In 705, when Li Bai was four years old, his father secretly moved his family to [[Sichuan]], near [[Chengdu]], where he spent his childhood</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wu, 58&quot;&gt;Wu, 58&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently a monument commemorating this in [[Zhongba Town]], [[Jiangyou]], Sichuan province (the area of the modern province then being known as Shu, after a former independent state</span>
				<span class='text'>which had been annexed by the Sui dynasty and later incorporated into the Tang dynasty lands)</span>
				<span class='text'>The young Li spent most of his growing years in Blue [also translated as &quot;green&quot;, &quot;azure&quot;, or &quot;nature-coloured&quot;] Lotus, a town in Chang-ming County, Sichuan, China</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Sun, 20&quot;/&gt; This now nominally corresponds with Qinglian Town (ÈùíËé≤Èïá) of [[Jiangyou]] [[County-level city]], in [[Sichuan]] Province</span>
				<span class='text'>he young Li read extensively, including [[Confucian classics]] such as ''[[Book of Songs (Chinese)|The Classic of Poetry (Shijing)]]'' and the ''[[Book of History|Classic of History (Shujing)]]'', as well as various astrological and metaphysical materials which Confucians tended to eschew</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wu, 58&quot;/&gt; Reading the &quot;Hundred Authors&quot; was part of the family literary tradition, and he was also able to compose poetry before he was ten</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Sun, 20&quot;/&gt; The young Li also engaged in other activities, such as taming wild birds and fencing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wu, 58&quot;/&gt; His other activities included riding, hunting, traveling, and aiding the poor or oppressed by means of both money and arms</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Sun, 20&quot;/&gt; Eventually, the young Li seems to have become quite proficient in the [[martial arts]]; as this autobiographical quote by Li himself both testifies to and also helps to illustrate the wild life that he led in the Sichuan of his youth:{{Quote|When I was fifteen, I was fond of sword play, and with that art I challenged quite a few great men</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wu, 58</span>
				<span class='text'>Translation by Wu</span>
				<span class='text'>Note that by [[East Asian age reckoning]], this would be fourteen rather than fifteen years old</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}Before he was twenty, Li had fought and killed several men, apparently for reasons of [[chivalry]], in accordance with the knight-errant tradition (''[[youxia]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wu, 58&quot;/&gt;In 720, he was interviewed by Governor Su Ting, who considered him a genius</span>
				<span class='text'>Though he expressed the wish to become an official, he never took the [[Chinese civil service examination|civil service examination]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The reason why Li never took what would seem to have been the logical step toward his stated desire was apparently for personal reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>==On the way to Chang'an===[[File:Dufuschina</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|300px|alt=Map of eastern interior Chinese cities of Luoyang, Chang'an, Qinzhou, Chengdu, Kuizhou, and Tanzhou|The China of Li Bai and Du Fu]]====Leaving Sichuan====In his mid-twenties, about 725, Li Bai left Sichuan, sailing down the [[Yangzi River]] through [[Dongting Lake]] to [[Nanjing]], beginning his days of wandering</span>
				<span class='text'>He then went back up-river, to [[Yunmeng]], in what is now [[Hubei]], where his marriage to the granddaughter of a retired prime minister, [[Xu Yushi]], seems to have formed but a brief interlude</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wu, 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; During the first year of his trip, he met celebrities and gave away much of his wealth to needy friends</span>
				<span class='text'>===Continuing on the way====In 730, Li Bai stayed at Zhongnan Mountain near the capital Chang'an (Xi'an), and tried but failed to secure a position</span>
				<span class='text'>He sailed down the Yellow River, stopped by Luoyang, and visited Taiyuan before going home</span>
				<span class='text'>In 735, Li Bai was in [[Shanxi]], where he intervened in a court martial against [[Guo Ziyi]], who was later, after becoming one of the top Tang generals, to repay the favour during the An Shi disturbances</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wu, 59&quot;/&gt; By perhaps 740, he had moved to [[Shandong]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was in Shandong, at this time, that he became one of the group known as the &quot;Six Idlers of the Bamboo Brook&quot;, an informal group dedicated to literature and wine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wu, 59&quot;/&gt; He wandered about the area of [[Zhejiang]] and [[Jiangsu]], eventually making friends with a famous Daoist priest, Wu Yun</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wu, 59&quot;/&gt; In 742, Wu Yun was summoned by the Emperor to attend the imperial court, where his praise of Li Bai was great</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wu, 59&quot;/&gt;===At Chang'an===Wu Yun's praise of Li Bai led [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] (born Li Longji and also known as Emperor Minghuang) to summon Li to the court in [[Chang'an]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Li's personality fascinated the aristocrats and common people alike, including another Taoist (and poet), [[He Zhizhang]], who bestowed upon him the nickname the &quot;Immortal Exiled from Heaven&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wu, 59&quot;/&gt; Indeed, after an initial audience, where Li Bai was questioned about his political views, the Emperor was so impressed that he held a big banquet in his honor</span>
				<span class='text'>At this banquet, the Emperor was said to show his favor, even to the extent of personally seasoning his soup for him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wu, 59&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obata, 201&lt;/ref&gt;Emperor Xuanzong employed him as a translator, as Li Bai knew at least one non-Chinese language</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wu, 59&quot;/&gt; Ming Huang eventually gave him a post at the [[Hanlin Academy]], which served to provide scholarly expertise and poetry for the Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>[Image:L'empereur Minghuang regardant Li Bai</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|250px|Emperor Minghuang, seated on a terrace, observes Li Bai write poetry while having his boots taken off (Qing dynasty illustration)</span>
				<span class='text'>]When the emperor ordered Li Bai to the palace, he was often drunk, but quite capable of performing on the spot</span>
				<span class='text'>i Bai wrote several poems about the Emperor's beautiful and beloved [[Yang Guifei]], the favorite royal consort</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wu, 60&quot;&gt;Wu, 60&lt;/ref&gt; A story, probably apocryphal, circulates about Li Bai during this period</span>
				<span class='text'>Once, while drunk, Li Bai had gotten his boots muddy, and [[Gao Lishi]], the most politically powerful [[Eunuch#China|eunuch]] in the palace, was asked to assist in the removal of these, in front of the Emperor</span>
				<span class='text'>Gao took offense at being asked to perform this menial service, and later managed to persuade Yang Guifei to take offense at Li's poems concerning her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wu, 60&quot;/&gt; At the persuasion of Yang Guifei and Gao Lishi, Xuanzong reluctantly, but politely, and with large gifts of gold and silver, sent Li Bai away from the royal court</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wu, 61&quot;&gt;Wu, 61&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving the court, Li Bai formally became a Taoist, making a home in [[Shandong]], but wandering far and wide for the next ten some years, writing poems</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wu, 61&quot;/&gt;===Meeting Du Fu==={{Further|Du Fu}}He met [[Du Fu]] in the autumn of 744, when they shared a single room and various activities together, such as traveling, hunting, wine, and poetry, thus established a close and lasting friendship</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Sun, 24 and 25&quot;&gt;Sun, 24 and 25&lt;/ref&gt; They met again the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>These were the only occasions on which they met, in person, although they continued to maintain a relationship through poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>This is reflected in the dozen or so Du Fu poems to or about Li Bai, which survive, and the one from Li Bai directed toward Du Fu which remains</span>
				<span class='text'>==War and exile===[[File:Riders on Horseback, Northern Qi Dynasty</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Riders on Horseback, Northern Qi Dynasty, the general area of the rebel heartland, although of an earlier date</span>
				<span class='text'>]At the end of 755, the disorders instigated by the rebel general [[An Shi Rebellion|An Lushan]] burst across the land</span>
				<span class='text'>The Emperor eventually fled to Sichuan and abdicated</span>
				<span class='text'>During the confusion, the Crown Prince opportunely declared himself Emperor and head of the government</span>
				<span class='text'>The An Shi disturbances continued (as they were later called, since they lasted beyond the death of their instigator, carried on by [[Shi Siming]], and others)</span>
				<span class='text'>Li Bai became a staff adviser to Prince Yong, one of [[Ming Huang]]'s (Emperor Xuanzong's) sons, who was far from the top of the primogeniture list, yet named to share the imperial power as a general after Xuanzong had abdicated, in 756</span>
				<span class='text'>owever, even before the empire's external enemies were defeated, the two brothers fell to fighting each other with their armies</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon the defeat of the Prince's forces by his brother the new emperor in 757, Li Bai escaped, but was later captured, imprisoned in [[Jiujiang]], and sentenced to death</span>
				<span class='text'>The famous and powerful army general [[Guo Ziyi]] and others intervened; Gou Ziyi was the very person whom Li Bai had saved from court martial a couple of decades before</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wu, 61&quot;/&gt; His wife, the lady Zong, and others (such as Song Ruosi) wrote petitions for clemency</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Sun, 26 and 27&quot;&gt;Sun, 26 and 27&lt;/ref&gt; Upon General Guo Ziyi's offering to exchange his official rank for Li Bai's life, Li Bai's death sentence was commuted to exile: he was consigned to [[Yelang]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wu, 61&quot;/&gt; Yelang (in what is now [[Guizhou]]) was in the remote extreme southwestern part of the empire, and was considered to be outside the main sphere of Chinese civilization and culture</span>
				<span class='text'>Li Bai headed toward Yelang with little sign of hurry, stopping for prolonged social visits (sometimes for months), and writing poetry along the way, leaving detailed descriptions of his journey for posterity</span>
				<span class='text'>Notice of an imperial pardon recalling Li Bai reached him before he even got near Yelang</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wu, 61&quot;/&gt; He had only gotten as far as [[Wu Gorge|Wushan]], when news of his pardon caught up with him in 759</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Sun, 26 and 27&quot;/&gt;===Return and other travels===When Li received the news of his imperial reprieve, he returned down the river to [[Jiangxi]], passing on the way through [[Baidicheng]], in [[Kuizhou]] Prefecture, still engaging in the pleasures of food, wine, good company, and writing poetry; his poem &quot;[[s:Translation:Departing from Baidi in the Morning|Departing from Baidi in the Morning]]&quot; records this stage of his travels, as well as poetically mocking his enemies and detractors, implied in his inclusion of [[Simians (Chinese poetry)|imagery of monkeys]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Li did not cease his wandering lifestyle, he then generally confined his travels to [[Nanjing]] and the two [[Anhui]] cities of [[Xuancheng]] and Li Yang (in modern [[Zhao County]])</span>

				<span class='text'>Although many of Li Bai's poems have survived, even more were lost and there is difficulty regarding variant texts</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the earliest endeavors at editing Li Bai's work was by his relative [[Li Yangbing]], the magistrate of [[Dangtu]], with whom he stayed in his final years and to whom he entrusted his manuscripts</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the most reliable texts are not necessarily in the earliest editions</span>
				<span class='text'>Song dynasty scholars produced various editions of his poetry, but it was not until the Qing dynasty that such collections as the ''[[Quan Tangshi]]'' (''Complete Tang Poems'') made the most comprehensive studies of the then surviving texts</span>

				<span class='text'>278-282, section &quot;The Sources and Their Limitations&quot; describes this history</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Themes==Critics have focused on Li Bai's strong sense of the continuity of poetic tradition, his glorification of alcoholic beverages (and, indeed, frank celebration of drunkenness), his use of persona, the fantastic extremes of some of his imagery, his mastery of formal poetic rules&amp;nbsp;‚Äì and his ability to combine all of these with a seemingly effortless virtuosity in order to produce inimitable poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>Other themes in Li's poetry, noted especially in the 20th century, are sympathy for the common folks and antipathy towards needless wars (even when conducted by the emperor himself)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sun, 28-35&lt;/ref&gt;===Poetic tradition===Li Bai had a strong sense of himself as being part of a poetic tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;genius&quot; of Li Bai, says one recent account, &quot;lies at once in his total command of the literary tradition before him and his ingenuity in bending (without breaking) it to discover a uniquely personal idiom</span>

				<span class='text'> 296</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Burton Watson]], comparing him to Du Fu, says Li's poetry, &quot;is essentially backward-looking, that it represents more a revival and fulfillment of past promises and glory than a foray into the future</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, 141&quot;&gt;Watson, 141&lt;/ref&gt; Watson adds, as evidence, that of all the poems attributed to Li Bai, about one sixth are in the form of ''[[yuefu]]'', or, in other words, reworked lyrics from traditional folk ballads</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Watson, 141-142&lt;/ref&gt; As further evidence, Watson cites the existence of a fifty-nine poem collection by Li Bai entitled ''Gu Feng'', or ''In the Old Manner'',  which is, in part, tribute to the poetry of the Han and Wei dynasties</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, 142&quot;&gt;Watson, 142&lt;/ref&gt; His admiration for certain particular poets is also shown through specific allusions, for example to [[Qu Yuan]] or [[Tao Yuanming]], and occasionally by name, for example Du Fu</span>
				<span class='text'> more general appreciation for history, is shown on the part of Li Bai in his poems of the ''[[Huaigu (poetry)|huaigu]]'' genre,&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 145&lt;/ref&gt; or meditations on the past, wherein following &quot;one of the perennial themes of Chinese poetry,&quot; &quot;the poet contemplates the ruins of past glory</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wu, 66&lt;/ref&gt;  Classical Chinese poets were often associated with drinking [[Chinese alcoholic beverages|wine]], and Li Bai was part of the group of Chinese scholars in Chang'an his fellow poet [[Du Fu]] called the &quot;[[Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Chinese generally did not find the moderate use of alcohol to be immoral or unhealthy</span>
				<span class='text'>James J</span>
				<span class='text'> Liu comments that  ''zui''  in poetry ‚Äúdoes not mean quite the same thing as ‚Äòdrunk,‚Äô ‚Äòintoxicated,‚Äô or ‚Äòinebriated‚Äô, but rather means being mentally carried away from one‚Äôs normal preoccupations</span>

				<span class='text'>'}}===Fantastic imagery===An important characteristic of Li Bai's poetry &quot;is the fantasy and note of childlike wonder and playfulness that pervade so much of it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, 142&quot;/&gt;  Burton Watson attributes this to a fascination with the ''[[daoshi]]'', [[Taoist]] recluses who practiced alchemy and austerities in the mountains, in the aim of becoming [[Xian (Taoism)|xian]], or immortal beings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, 142&quot;/&gt; There is a strong element of Taoism in his works, both in the sentiments they express and in their spontaneous tone, and &quot;many of his poems deal with mountains, often descriptions of ascents that midway modulate into journeys of the imagination, passing from actual mountain scenery to visions of nature deities, immortals, and 'jade maidens' of Taoist lore</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, 142&quot;/&gt; Watson sees this as another affirmation of Li Bai's affinity with the past, and a continuity with the traditions of the [[Chuci]] and the early [[Fu (literature)|fu]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, 143&quot;/&gt; Watson finds this &quot;element of fantasy&quot; to be behind Li Bai's use of [[hyperbole]] and the &quot;playful personifications&quot; of mountains and celestial objects</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, 143&quot;/&gt;===Nostalgia===The critic James J</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Liu notes ‚ÄúChinese poets seem to be perpetually bewailing their exile and longing to return home</span>
				<span class='text'>This may seem sentimental to Western readers, but one should remember the vastness of China, the difficulties of communication</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the sharp contrast between the highly cultured life in the main cities and the harsh conditions in the remoter regions of the country, and the importance of family</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>‚Äù It is hardly surprising, he concludes, that nostalgia should have become a &quot;constant, and hence conventional, theme in Chinese poetry</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Liu gives as a prime example Li's poem &quot;A Quiet Night Thought&quot; (also translated as &quot;Contemplating Moonlight&quot;), which is often learned by schoolchildren in China</span>
				<span class='text'> In a mere 20 words, the poem uses the vivid moonlight and frost imagery to convey the feeling of [[homesickness]]</span>
				<span class='text'> There are several editions of the poem</span>

				<span class='text'>ift my head and see the moonLower my head and pine for home</span>
				<span class='text'>}===Use of persona===Li Bai also wrote a number of poems from various viewpoints, including the [[persona]]e of women</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, he wrote several poems in the [[Six dynasties poetry|''Zi Ye'', or &quot;Lady Midnight&quot; style]], as well as Han folk-ballad style poems</span>
				<span class='text'>==Technical virtuosity===Li Bai is well known for the technical virtuosity of his poetry and the mastery of his verses</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, 141&quot;/&gt; In terms of poetic form, &quot;critics generally agree that Li [Bai] produced no significant innovations</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>In theme and content also, his poetry is notable less for the new elements it introduces than for the skill with which he brightens the old ones</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, 141&quot;/&gt;Burton Watson comments on Li Bai's famous poem, which he translates &quot;Bring the Wine&quot;: &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ike so much of Li [Bai]'s work, it has a grace and effortless dignity that somehow make it more compelling than earlier treatment of the same</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Watson, 144&lt;/ref&gt;Li Bai's [[yuefu]] poems has been called the greatest of all time by [[Ming Dynasty]] scholar and writer [[Hu Yinglin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Shisou(Thickets of Poetic Criticism)&lt;/ref&gt;Li Bai especially excelled in the [[gushi (poetry)|Gushi]] form, or &quot;old style&quot; poems, a type of poetry allowing a great deal of freedom in terms of the form and content of the work</span>
				<span class='text'>An example is his poem &quot;ËúÄÈÅìÈõ£&quot;, translated by Witter Bynner as &quot;Hard Roads in Shu</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Shu is a poetic term for Sichuan, the destination of refuge that Emperor Xuanzong considered fleeing to escape the approaching forces of the rebel General [[An Lushan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Watson comments that, this poem, &quot;employs lines that range in length from four to eleven characters, the form of the lines suggesting by their irregularity the jagged peaks and bumpy mountain roads of Sichuan depicted in the poem</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson, 141&quot;/&gt;Li Bai was also noted as a master of the [[Jueju]], or cut-verse</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Watson, 146&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ming Dynasty]] poet Li Pan Long thought Li Bai was the greatest [[jueju]] master of the [[Tang dynasty]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Selections of Tang Poetry&lt;/ref&gt;Li Bai was noted for his mastery of the [[Lushi (poetry)|Lushi]], or &quot;regulated verse&quot;, the formally most demanding verse form of the times</span>
				<span class='text'>Watson notes, however, that his poem &quot;Seeing a Friend Off&quot; was &quot;unusual in that it violates the rule that the two middle couplets </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>must observe verbal parallelism,&quot; adding that Chinese critics excused this kind of violation in the case of a genius like Li</span>

				<span class='text'>From early on, he was paired with Du Fu</span>
				<span class='text'>The recent scholar Paula Varsano observes that &quot;in the literary imagination they were, and remain, the Two Greatest Poets of the Tang‚Äîor even of China</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Yet she notes the persistence of &quot;what we can rightly call the 'Li-Du debate,' the terms of which became so deeply ingrained in the critical discourse surrounding these two poets that almost any characterization of the one implicitly critiqued the other</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfnb|Varsano|2014}} Li's influence has also been demonstrated in the immediate geographical area of Chinese cultural influence, being known as Ri Haku in Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>This influence continues even today</span>
				<span class='text'>Examples range from poetry to painting and to literature</span>
				<span class='text'>n his own lifetime, during his many wanderings and while he was attending court in Chang'an, met and parted from various contemporary poets</span>
				<span class='text'>These meetings and separations were a typical occasion for versification in the tradition of the literate Chinese of the time, a prime example being his relationship with Du Fu</span>
				<span class='text'>fter his lifetime, his influence continued to grow</span>
				<span class='text'>Some four centuries later, during the [[Song dynasty]], for example, just in the case of his poem that is sometimes translated &quot;Drinking Alone Beneath the Moon&quot;, the poet [[Yang Wanli]] wrote a whole poem alluding to it (and to two other Li Bai poems), in the same ''gushi'', or Old-style Poetry form</span>
