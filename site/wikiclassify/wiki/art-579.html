				<span class='text'>430&amp;nbsp;‚Äì 354 BC), son of Gryllus, of the [[deme]] Erchia of [[Classical Athens|Athens]], also known as '''Xenophon of Athens''', was a Greek [[historian]], [[soldier]], [[mercenary]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Mercenary#Classic era]]&lt;/ref&gt; and student of [[Socrates]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While not referred to as a philosopher by his contemporaries, his status as such is now a topic of debate</span>
				<span class='text'>He is known for writing about the history of his own times, the late 5th and early 4th centuries BC, especially for his account of the final years of the [[Peloponnesian War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His ''[[Hellenica]]'', which recounts these times, is considered to be the continuation of [[Thucydides]]‚Äô ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>His youthful participation in the failed campaign of [[Cyrus the Younger]] to claim the Persian throne inspired him to write his most famous work, ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>espite growing up in Athens and being an Athenian citizen, Xenophon is also associated with [[Sparta]], the traditional of Sparta</span>
				<span class='text'>His pro-[[oligarchic]] views, service under Spartan generals in the Persian campaign and beyond, as well as his friendship with [[Agesilaus II|King Agesilaus II]] endeared Xenophon to the Spartans, and them to him</span>
				<span class='text'>A number of his writings display his pro-Spartan bias and admiration, especially ''[[Agesilaus (Xenophon)|Agesilaus]]'' and ''Constitution of Sparta''</span>
				<span class='text'>ther than [[Plato]], Xenophon is the foremost authority on Socrates, having learned under the great philosopher while a young man</span>
				<span class='text'>He greatly admired his teacher, and well after Socrates‚Äô death in 399 Xenophon wrote several [[Socratic dialogue]]s, including an [[Apology (Xenophon)|''Apology'']] concerning the events of his trial and death</span>
				<span class='text'>enophon‚Äôs works cover a wide range of genres and are written in very uncomplicated [[Attic Greek]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Xenophon‚Äôs works are among the first that many students of Ancient Greek translate on account of the straightforward and succinct nature of his prose</span>
				<span class='text'>This sentiment was apparent even in ancient times, as [[Diogenes Laertius]] states in his ''[[Lives of Eminent Philosophers]]'' (2</span>
				<span class='text'>) that Xenophon was sometimes known as the &quot;Attic Muse&quot; for the sweetness of his diction</span>
				<span class='text'>=Life=====Early years===Little is known about Xenophon other than what he wrote about himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Xenophon was born around 430 BC near the city of Athens to a wealthy equestrian family</span>

				<span class='text'>It was in this year that Xenophon was convinced by his Boeotian friend Proxenus (''Anabasis'' 3</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>) to participate in the expedition led by Cyrus the Younger against his older brother, [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|King Artaxerxes II]] of [[Persia]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Xenophon writes that he had asked the veteran Socrates for advice on whether to go with Cyrus, and that Socrates referred him to the divinely inspired [[Delphic oracle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Xenophon's query to the oracle, however, was not whether or not to accept Cyrus' invitation, but &quot;to which of the gods he must pray and do sacrifice, so that he might best accomplish his intended journey and return in safety, with good fortune&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The oracle answered his question and told him to which gods to pray and sacrifice</span>
				<span class='text'>When Xenophon returned to Athens and told Socrates of the oracle's advice, Socrates chastised him for asking so disingenuous a question (''Anabasis'' 3</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>‚Äì7)</span>
				<span class='text'>nder the pretext of fighting [[Tissaphernes]], the Persian [[satrap]] of [[Ionia]], Cyrus assembled a massive army composed of native Persian soldiers, but also a large number of Greeks</span>
				<span class='text'>Prior to waging war against Artaxerxes, Cyrus proposed that the enemy was the [[Pisidia]]ns, and so the Greeks were unaware that they were to battle against the larger army of King Artaxerxes II (''Anabasis'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>‚Äì11)</span>
				<span class='text'>At [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] the soldiers became aware of Cyrus's plans to depose the king, and as a result, refused to continue (''Anabasis'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>)</span>
				<span class='text'>However, [[Clearchus of Sparta|Clearchus]], a Spartan general, convinced the Greeks to continue with the expedition</span>
				<span class='text'>The army of Cyrus met the army of Artaxerxes II in the [[Battle of Cunaxa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite effective fighting by the Greeks, Cyrus was killed in the battle (''Anabasis'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>7‚Äì1</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>)</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly thereafter, Clearchus was invited to a peace conference, where, alongside four other generals and many captains, he was betrayed and executed (''Anabasis'' 2</span>

				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|400px|Route of Xenophon and the [[Ten Thousand (Greek)|Ten Thousand]]]]The [[mercenaries]], known as the [[Ten Thousand]], found themselves without leadership far from the sea, deep in hostile territory near the heart of [[Mesopotamia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They elected new leaders, including Xenophon himself, and fought their way north along the [[Tigris]] through hostile Persians and [[Medes]] to [[Trabzon|Trapezus]] on the coast of the [[Black Sea]] (''Anabasis'' 4</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>2)</span>
				<span class='text'>They then made their way westward back to [[Greece]] via [[√úsk√ºdar#Chrysopolis|Chrysopolis]] (''Anabasis'' 6</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>6)</span>
				<span class='text'>Once there, they helped [[Seuthes II]] make himself king of [[Thrace]], before being recruited into the army of the Spartan general [[Thimbron (fl</span>
				<span class='text'>400‚Äì391 BC)|Thibron]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Spartans were at war with Tissaphernes and [[Pharnabazus (5th century BC)|Pharnabazus]], Persian satraps in [[Anatolia]], probably on account of the aforementioned treacherous slaughter of their general Clearchus</span>
				<span class='text'>Xenophon‚Äôs military activity with these Spartans marks the final episodes of the ''Anabasis'' (Books 6‚Äì7)</span>
				<span class='text'>==Exile and death===Upon his return to Greece proper, Xenophon continued to associate with the Spartans, even so far as to fight under the Spartan king [[Agesilaus II]] against his native Athens in the [[Battle of Coronea (394 BC)|Battle of Coronea]] in 394 BC</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; ISBN 9780199216185&lt;/ref&gt; Although Xenophon seems to prefer oligarchy, or at least the aristocracy, especially in light of his associations with Sparta, none of his works explicitly attack democracy, unless his account of democratic proceedings in the Anabasis be interpreted as anti-democracy when deliberations are intimidated by cries of &quot;pelt&quot; if a speaker says something others disagree with</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; go so far as to say his views aligned with those of the democracy in his time</span>
				<span class='text'>However, certain works of Xenophon, in particular the ''[[Cyropaedia]]'', appear to display his pro-oligarchic politics</span>
				<span class='text'>This historical-fiction serves as a forum for Xenophon to subtly display his political inclinations</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Cyropaedia''=======Relations between Medes and Persians in the ''Cyropaedia''====Xenophon wrote the ''Cyropaedia'' to present his political and moral philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>He did this by endowing a historical figure, Cyrus, with the qualities that should be possessed by Xenophon's ideal ruler</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians have asked whether Xenophon's portrait was an accurate portrayal Cyrus alone or if Xenophon imbued him with events from his own life</span>
				<span class='text'>The consensus is that Cyrus‚Äôs career is best outlined in the ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>But Steven Hirsch writes, &quot;Yet there are occasions when it can be confirmed from Oriental evidence that Xenophon is correct where Herodotus is wrong or lacks information</span>
				<span class='text'>A case in point involves the ancestry of Cyrus</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus contradicts Xenophon at several other points, most notably in the matter of Cyrus‚Äôs relationship with the Median Kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>Herodotus says that Cyrus led a rebellion against his maternal grandfather, [[Astyages]] king of Media, and defeated him, thereafter (improbably) keeping Astyages in his court for the remainder of his life (''Histories'' 1</span>
				<span class='text'>30)</span>
				<span class='text'>The Medes were thus &quot;reduced to subjection&quot; (1</span>
				<span class='text'>30) and became &quot;slaves&quot; (1</span>
				<span class='text'>29) to the Persians 20 years before the capture of Babylon in 539 B</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he ''Cyropaedia'' relates instead that Astyages died and was succeeded by his son Cyaxares II, the maternal uncle of Cyrus (1</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>)</span>
				<span class='text'>In the initial campaign against the Lydians, Babylonians and their allies, the Medians were led by Cyaxares and the Persians by Cyrus, who was crown prince of the Persians, since his father was still alive (4</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>7)</span>
				<span class='text'> Xenophon relates that at this time the Medes were the strongest of the kingdoms that opposed the Babylonians (1</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>)</span>
				<span class='text'>There is an echo of this statement, verifying Xenophon and contradicting Herodotus, in the Harran Stele, a document from the court of [[Nabonidus]]</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>, Nabonidus speaks of his enemies as the kings of Egypt, the Medes, and the Arabs</span>
				<span class='text'>There is no mention of the Persians,although according to Herodotus and the current consensus the Medians had been made &quot;slaves&quot; of the Persians several years previously</span>
				<span class='text'>It does not seem that Nabonidus would be completely misled about who his enemies were, or who was really in control over the Medes and Persians just one to three years before his kingdom fell to their armies</span>

				<span class='text'>These show no distinction in official rank or status between the Persian and Median nobility</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Olmstead followed the consensus view that Cyrus subjugated the Medes, he nevertheless wrote, &quot;Medes were honored equally with Persians; they were employed in high office and were chosen to lead Persian armies</span>

				<span class='text'>In the [[Nabonidus Chronicle]], there is mention of the death of the wife of the king (name not given) within a month after the capture of Babylon</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pritchard, ''Ancient Near Eastern Texts'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>306b</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It has been conjectured that this was Cyrus‚Äôs first wife, which lends credibility to the ''Cyropaedia''‚Äôs statement (8</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>9) that Cyaxares II gave his daughter in marriage to Cyrus soon (but not immediately) after the fall of the city, with the kingdom of Media as her dowry</span>
				<span class='text'>When Cyaxares died about two years later the Median kingdom passed peaceably to Cyrus, so that this would be the true beginning of the Medo-Persian Empire under just one monarch</span>
				<span class='text'>===Persians as centaurs====The ''Cyropaedia'' as a whole lavishes a great deal of praise on the first Persian emperor, [[Cyrus II|Cyrus the Great]], on account of his virtue and leadership quality, and it was through his greatness that the Persian Empire held together</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus this book is normally read as a positive treatise about Cyrus</span>
				<span class='text'>However, following the lead of [[Leo Strauss]], David Johnson suggests that there is a subtle but strong layer to the book in which Xenophon conveys criticism of not only the Persians but the Spartans and Athenians as well</span>

				<span class='text'>177‚Äì207</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In section 4</span>
				<span class='text'> of the ''Cyropaedia'' Cyrus makes clear his desire to institute cavalry</span>
				<span class='text'>He even goes so far to say that he desires that no Persian ''[http://www</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>2‚Äì23)</span>
				<span class='text'>Centaurs were often thought of as creatures of ill repute,  which makes even Cyrus‚Äô own advisors wary of the label</span>
				<span class='text'>His minister Chrysantas admires the centaurs for their dual nature, but also warns that the dual nature does not allow centaurs to fully enjoy or act as either one of their aspects in full (4</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>9‚Äì20)</span>
				<span class='text'>n labeling Persians as centaurs through the mouth of Cyrus, Xenophon plays upon the popular post-Persian-war propagandistic paradigm of using mythological imagery to represent the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Greco-Persian conflict]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Examples of this include the wedding of the [[Lapiths]], giantomachy, [[Trojan War]], and [[Amazonomachy]] on the [[Parthenon Frieze|Parthenon frieze]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson reads even more deeply into the centaur label</span>
				<span class='text'>He believes that the unstable dichotomy of man and horse found in a centaur is indicative of the unstable and unnatural alliance of Persian and Mede formulated by Cyrus</span>

				<span class='text'>1, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>177‚Äì207</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Persian hardiness and austerity is combined with the luxuriousness of the Medes, two qualities that cannot coexist</span>
				<span class='text'>He cites the regression of the Persians directly after the death of Cyrus as a result of this instability, a union made possible only through the impeccable character of Cyrus</span>

				<span class='text'>177‚Äì207</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In a further analysis of the centaur model, Cyrus is likened to a centaur such as [[Chiron]], a noble example from an ignoble race</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus this entire paradigm seems to be a jab at the Persians and an indication of Xenophon‚Äôs general distaste for the Persians</span>
				<span class='text'>===Against empire/monarchy====The strength of Cyrus in holding the empire together is praiseworthy according to Xenophon</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the empire began to decline upon the death of Cyrus</span>
				<span class='text'>By this example Xenophon sought to show that empires lacked stability and could only be maintained by a person of remarkable prowess, such as Cyrus</span>

				<span class='text'>177‚Äì207</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus is idealized greatly in the narrative</span>
				<span class='text'>Xenophon displays Cyrus as a cold, passionless man</span>
				<span class='text'>This is not to say that he was not a good ruler, but he is depicted as surreal and not subject to the foibles of other men</span>
				<span class='text'>By showing that only someone who is almost beyond human could conduct such an enterprise as empire, Xenophon indirectly censures imperial design</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus he also reflects on the state of his own reality in an even more indirect fashion, using the example of the Persians to decry the attempts at empire made by Athens and Sparta</span>

				<span class='text'>177‚Äì207&lt;/ref&gt; Although partially graced with hindsight, having written the ''Cyropaedia'' after the downfall of Athens in the Peloponnesian War, this work criticizes the Greek attempts at empire and &quot;monarchy&quot;, dooming them to failure</span>
				<span class='text'>===Against democracy====Another passage that Johnson cites as criticism of monarchy and empire concerns the devaluation of the ''homotƒ´moi''</span>
				<span class='text'>The manner in which this occurs seems also to be a subtle yet poignant jab at democracy</span>
				<span class='text'>''Homotƒ´moi'' were highly and thoroughly educated and thus became the core of the soldiery as heavy infantry</span>
				<span class='text'>As the name ''homotƒ´moi'' (&quot;equal&quot;, or &quot;same honors&quot; i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;peers&quot;) suggests, their small band (1000 when Cyrus fought the [[Assyrians]]) shared equally in the spoils of war</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D</span>
				<span class='text'>M</span>
				<span class='text'>2005</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Persians as Centaurs in Xenophon‚Äôs ‚ÄòCyropaedia‚Äô&quot;, ''Transactions of the American Philological Association''</span>
				<span class='text'>Vol 135, No</span>
				<span class='text'>1, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>177‚Äì207</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, in the face of overwhelming numbers in a campaign against the Assyrians, Cyrus armed the commoners with similar arms instead of their normal light ranged armament (''Cyropaedia'' 2</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>)</span>
				<span class='text'>Argument ensued as to how the spoils would now be split, and Cyrus enforced a meritocracy</span>
				<span class='text'>Many ''homotƒ´moi'' found this unfair because their military training was no better than the commoners, only their education, and hand-to-hand combat was less a matter of skill than strength and bravery</span>
				<span class='text'>As Johnson asserts, this passage decries imperial meritocracy and corruption, for the ''homotƒ´moi'' now had to sychophantize to the emperor for positions and honors;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D</span>
				<span class='text'>M</span>
				<span class='text'>2005</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Persians as Centaurs in Xenophon‚Äôs ‚ÄòCyropaedia‚Äô&quot;, ''Transactions of the American Philological Association''</span>
				<span class='text'>Vol 135, No</span>
				<span class='text'>1, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>177‚Äì207</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; from this point they were referred to as ''entƒ´moi'', no longer of the &quot;same honors&quot; but having to be &quot;in&quot; to get the honor</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, the passage seems to be critical of democracy, or at least sympathetic to aristocrats within democracy, for the ''homotƒ´moi'' (aristocracy/oligarchs) are devalued upon the empowerment of the commoners (''demos'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Although empire emerges in this case, this is also a sequence of events associated with democracy</span>
				<span class='text'>Through his dual critique of empire and democracy, Xenophon subtly relates his support of oligarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Constitution of the Spartans''===The Spartans wrote nothing about themselves, or if they did it is lost</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, what we know about them comes exclusively from outsiders, such as Xenophon</span>
				<span class='text'>Xenophon‚Äôs affinity for the Spartans is clear in the ''[http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>erseus</span>
				<span class='text'>ufts</span>
				<span class='text'>du/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999</span>
				<span class='text'>1</span>
				<span class='text'>210%3atext%3dConst</span>
				<span class='text'>Lac</span>
				<span class='text'>Constitution of the Spartans]'', as well as his penchant for oligarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>The opening line reads:&lt;blockquote&gt;It occurred to me one day that Sparta, though among the most thinly populated of states, was evidently the most powerful and most celebrated city in Greece; and I fell to wondering how this could have happened</span>
				<span class='text'>But when I considered the institutions of the Spartans, I wondered no longer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;Xenophon goes on to describe in detail the main aspects of the [[Lacedaemonian]] state, handing to us the most comprehensive extant analysis of the institutions of Sparta</span>
				<span class='text'>==Old Oligarch===A short treatise on the ''[[Constitution of Athens]]'' exists that was once thought to be by Xenophon, but which was probably written when Xenophon was about five years old</span>
				<span class='text'>The author, often called in English the &quot;[[Old Oligarch]]&quot; or Pseudo-Xenophon, detests the democracy of Athens and the poorer classes, but he argues that the Periclean institutions are well designed for their deplorable purposes</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the real Xenophon seems to prefer oligarchy over democracy, none of his works so ardently decry democracy as does the Constitution of the Athenians</span>
				<span class='text'>However, this treatise makes evident that anti-democratic sentiments were extant in Athens in the late 5th century B</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and were only increased after its shortcomings were exploited and made apparent during the Peloponnesian War</span>
				<span class='text'>=Socratic works and dialogues==Xenophon‚Äôs works includes a selection of Socratic dialogues</span>
				<span class='text'>These writings are completely preserved</span>
				<span class='text'>Except for the dialogues of [[Plato]], they are the only surviving representatives of the genre of ''[[Sokratikoi logoi]]'' (Socratic dialogues)</span>
				<span class='text'>These works include Xenophon's ''[[Apology (Xenophon)|Apology]], [[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]], [[Symposium (Xenophon)|Symposium]],'' and ''[[Oeconomicus]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Symposium'' outlines the character of [[Socrates]] as he and his companions discuss what attribute they take pride in</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Oeconomicus'', Socrates explains how to manage a household</span>
				<span class='text'>Both the ''Apology'' and ''Memorabilia'' defend Socrates‚Äô character and teachings</span>
				<span class='text'>The former is set during the trial of Socrates, essentially defending Socrates‚Äô loss and death, while the latter is a general defense of Socrates, explaining his moral principles and that he was not a corrupter of the youth</span>
				<span class='text'>==Relationship with Socrates===Xenophon was a student of Socrates, and their personal relationship is evident through a direct conversation between the two in Xenophon‚Äôs ''Anabasis''</span>
				<span class='text'>Xenophon's admiration for his teacher is clear in writings such as ''Symposium'', ''Apology'', and ''Memorabilia''</span>
				<span class='text'> Xenophon was away on his Persian campaign during the trial and death of Socrates</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, much of Xenophon's Socratic writing, especially ''Apology'', concerns that very trial and the defense Socrates put forward</span>
				<span class='text'>n his ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers'', the Greek biographer Diogenes Laertius reports how Xenophon met Socrates</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;They say that Socrates met [Xenophon] in a narrow lane, and put his stick across it and prevented him from passing by, asking him where all kinds of necessary things were sold</span>
				<span class='text'>And when he had answered him, he asked him again where men were made good and virtuous</span>
				<span class='text'>And as he did not know, he said, ‚ÄòFollow me, then, and learn</span>
				<span class='text'>Äô And from this time forth, Xenophon became a follower of Socrates</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laertius|first1=Diogenes|title=thegreatthinkers</span>
				<span class='text'>rg|url=http://thegreatthinkers</span>
				<span class='text'>rg/xenophon/introduction/|website=Great Thinkers|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Socrates: Xenophon vs</span>
				<span class='text'>Plato===Both Plato and Xenophon wrote an ''Apology'' concerning the death of Socrates</span>
				<span class='text'>The two writers seem more concerned about answering questions that arose after the trial than about the actual charges</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, Xenophon and Plato are concerned with the failures of Socrates to defend himself</span>
				<span class='text'>The Socrates that Xenophon portrayed was different from Plato‚Äôs in multiple respects</span>
				<span class='text'>Xenophon asserts that Socrates dealt with his prosecution in an exceedingly arrogant manner, or at least was perceived to have spoken arrogantly</span>
				<span class='text'>Conversely, while not omitting it completely, Plato worked to temper that arrogance in his own ''Apology''</span>
				<span class='text'>Xenophon framed Socrates‚Äô defense, which both men admit was not prepared at all, not as failure to effectively argue his side, but as striving for death even in the light of unconvincing charges</span>
				<span class='text'>As Danzig interprets it, convincing the jury to condemn him even on unconvincing charges would be a rhetorical challenge worthy of the great persuader</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Danzig, Gabriel</span>

				<span class='text'>2, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>281‚Äì321</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Xenophon uses this interpretation as justification for Socrates‚Äô arrogant stance and conventional failure</span>
				<span class='text'>By contrast, Plato does not go so far as to claim that Socrates actually desired death, but seems to argue that Socrates was attempting to demonstrate a higher moral standard and teach a lesson, although his defense failed by conventional standards</span>
				<span class='text'>This places Socrates in a higher moral position than his prosecutors, a typical Platonic example of absolving &quot;Socrates from blame in every conceivable way</span>

				<span class='text'>281‚Äì321</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Historical reality===Although Xenophon claims to have been present at the ''Symposium'', this is impossible as he was only a young boy at the date which he proposes it occurred</span>
				<span class='text'>And again, Xenophon was not present at the trial of Socrates, having been on campaign in [[Anatolia]] and [[Persia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus he puts into the latter‚Äôs mouth what he would have thought him to say</span>
				<span class='text'>It seems that Xenophon wrote his ''Apology'' and  ''Memorabilia'' as defenses of his former teacher, not to explain Socrates' relationship to the actual charges incurred</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Modern reception===Xenophon's standing as a political philosopher has been defended in recent times by [[Leo Strauss]], who devoted a considerable part of his philosophic analysis to the works of Xenophon, returning to the high judgment of Xenophon as a thinker expressed by [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]], [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]], [[Niccol√≤ Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] and [[John Adams]]</span>
				<span class='text'>enophon‚Äôs lessons on leadership have been reconsidered for their modern-day value</span>
				<span class='text'>Jennifer O‚ÄôFlannery holds that &quot;discussions of leadership and civic virtue should include the work of Xenophon</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>on public education for public service</span>

				<span class='text'>The linking of moral code and education is an especially pertinent quality subscribed to Cyrus that O‚ÄôFlannery believes is in line with modern perceptions of leadership</span>

				<span class='text'>In the preface Strassler writes (xxi), &quot;Fifteen works were transmitted through antiquity under Xenophon's name, and fortunately all fifteen have come down to us&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The following list of his works exhibits the extensive breadth of genres in which Xenophon wrote</span>
				<span class='text'>==Historical and biographical works===* ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' (also: ''The Persian Expedition'' or ''The March Up Country'' or The ''Expedition of Cyrus''): Provides an early life biography of Xenophon</span>

				<span class='text'> ''[[Cyropaedia (Xenophon)|Cyropaedia]]'' (also: ''The Education of Cyrus)''* ''[[Hellenica (Xenophon)|Hellenica]]'': His ''Hellenica'' is a major primary source for events in Greece from 411 to 362 BC, and is considered to be the continuation of the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' by [[Thucydides]], going so far as to begin with the phrase &quot;Following these events</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The Hellenica recounts the last seven years of the Peloponnesian war, as well as its aftermath</span>

				<span class='text'>==Short treatises===These works were probably written by Xenophon when he was living in Scillus</span>
				<span class='text'>His days were likely spent in relative leisure here, and he wrote these treatises about the sorts of activities he spent time on</span>
				<span class='text'> ''[[On Horsemanship]]'': Treatise on how to break, train, and care for horses</span>
				<span class='text'> ''[[Hipparchicus|Hipparchikos]]'': Outlines the duties of a cavalry officer</span>
