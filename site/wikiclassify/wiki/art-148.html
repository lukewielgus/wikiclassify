				<span class='text'>vg}} '''Edmund Spenser''' ({{IPAc-en|Àà|s|p|…õ|n|s|…ôr}}; 1552/1553 ‚Äì 13 January 1599) was an English poet best known for ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', an epic poem and fantastical [[allegory]] celebrating the [[Tudor dynasty]] and [[Elizabeth I]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He is recognized as one of the premier craftsmen of nascent Modern English verse, and is often considered one of the greatest poets in the English language</span>
				<span class='text'>=Life==Edmund Spenser was born in East Smithfield, London, around the year 1552, though there is some ambiguity as to the exact date of his birth</span>
				<span class='text'>As a young boy, he was educated in London at the [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]] and matriculated as a [[sizar]] at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]]</span>

				<span class='text'> Spenser served under Lord Gray with [[Walter Raleigh]] at the [[Siege of Smerwick]] massacre</span>

				<span class='text'>Raleigh acquired other nearby Munster estates confiscated in the [[Second Desmond Rebellion]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Some time between 1587 and 1589, Spenser acquired his main estate at Kilcolman, near Doneraile in North Cork</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hadfield, pp200-01&lt;/ref&gt; He later bought a second holding to the south, at Rennie, on a rock overlooking the river [[Munster Blackwater|Blackwater]] in North Cork</span>
				<span class='text'>Its ruins are still visible today</span>
				<span class='text'>A short distance away grew a tree, locally known as &quot;Spenser's Oak&quot; until it was destroyed in a lightning strike in the 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>Local legend has it that he penned some of ''The Faerie Queene'' under this tree</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hadfield, p362&lt;/ref&gt;In 1590, Spenser brought out the first three books of his most famous work, ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', having travelled to London to publish and promote the work, with the likely assistance of Raleigh</span>
				<span class='text'> He was successful enough to obtain a life pension of ¬£50 a year from the Queen</span>
				<span class='text'> He probably hoped to secure a place at court through his poetry, but his next significant publication boldly antagonised the queen's principal secretary, [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley (William Cecil)]], through its inclusion of the satirical ''[[Mother Hubberd's Tale]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hadfield, p165&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Ireland</span>
				<span class='text'>y 1594, Spenser's first wife had died, and in that year he married Elizabeth Boyle, to whom he addressed the sonnet sequence ''[[Amoretti]]''</span>
				<span class='text'> The marriage itself was celebrated in ''[[Epithalamion]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hadfield, pp296, 301&lt;/ref&gt; They had a son named Peregrine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;westminster-abbey</span>
				<span class='text'>rg&quot;/&gt;In 1596, Spenser wrote a prose pamphlet titled ''A View of the Present State of Ireland''</span>
				<span class='text'>This piece, in the form of a dialogue, circulated in manuscript, remaining unpublished until the mid-seventeenth century</span>
				<span class='text'>It is probable that it was kept out of print during the author's lifetime because of its inflammatory content</span>
				<span class='text'>The pamphlet argued that Ireland would never be totally 'pacified' by the English until its indigenous language and customs had been destroyed, if necessary by violence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hadfield, pp 334‚Äì43, 365&lt;/ref&gt;In 1598, during the [[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years War]], Spenser was driven from his home by the native Irish forces of [[Hugh √ì Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone|Aodh √ì N√©ill]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His castle at Kilcolman was burned, and [[Ben Jonson]], who may have had private information, asserted that one of his infant children died in the blaze</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hadfield, p 362&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Fowre Hymnes by Edmund Spenser 1596</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|230px|[[Title page]], ''Fowre Hymnes'', by Edmund Spenser, published by [[William Ponsonby (publisher)|William Ponsonby]], London, 1596]]In the year after being driven from his home, 1599, Spenser travelled to London, where he died at the age of forty-six ‚Äì &quot;for want of bread&quot;, according to [[Ben Jonson]], which is ironic considering Spenser's approving writing on the scorched-earth policy that caused famine in Ireland</span>

				<span class='text'>hp?textsid=33213&lt;/ref&gt; His coffin was carried to his grave in [[Westminster Abbey]] by other poets, who threw many pens and pieces of poetry into his grave with many tears</span>
				<span class='text'> His second wife survived him and remarried twice</span>
				<span class='text'>His sister Sarah, who had accompanied him to Ireland, married into the Travers family, and her descendants were prominent landowners in Cork for centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>=Rhyme and reason==[[Thomas Fuller]], in ''Worthies of England'', included a story where the Queen told her treasurer, William Cecil, to pay Spenser one hundred pounds for his poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>The treasurer, however, objected that the sum was too much</span>
				<span class='text'>She said, &quot;Then give him what is reason&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Without receiving his payment in due time, Spenser gave the Queen this [[quatrain]] on one of her progresses:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;I was promis'd on a time,To have a reason for my rhyme:From that time unto this season,I receiv'd nor rhyme nor reason</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;She immediately ordered the treasurer pay Spenser the original ¬£100</span>
				<span class='text'>his story seems to have attached itself to Spenser from [[Thomas Churchyard]], who apparently had difficulty in getting payment of his pension, the only other pension Elizabeth awarded to a poet</span>
				<span class='text'> Spenser seems to have had no difficulty in receiving payment when it was due as the pension was being collected for him by his publisher, Ponsonby</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hadfield pp 5 &amp; 236&lt;/ref&gt;==The Shepherd's Calendar=={{main|The Shepherd's Calendar}}[[File:Title Page of a 1617 Edition of The Shepherd's Calendar</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Title Page of a 1617 Edition of The Shepherd's Calendar printed by Matthew Lownes, often bound with the complete works printed in 1611 or 1617</span>
				<span class='text'>][[The Shepherd's Calendar]] is Edmund Spenser's first major work, which appeared in 1579</span>
				<span class='text'>It emulates [[Virgil]]'s [[Eclogues]] of the first century BCE and the Eclogues of Mantuan by [[Baptista Mantuanus]], a late medieval, early renaissance poet</span>
				<span class='text'>An eclogue is a short pastoral poem that is in the form of a dialogue or soliloquy</span>
				<span class='text'>Although all the months together form an entire year, each month stands alone as a separate poem</span>
				<span class='text'>Editions of the late 16th and early 17th centuries include woodcuts for each month/poem, and thereby have a slight similarity to an emblem book which combines a number of self-contained pictures and texts, usually a short vignette, saying, or allegory with an accompanying illustration</span>
				<span class='text'> ==The Faerie Queene=={{main|The Faerie Queene}}[[File:The Faerie Queene frontispiece</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|The epic poem ''The Faerie Queene'' frontispiece, printed by William Ponsonby in 1590</span>
				<span class='text'>]Spenser's masterpiece is the [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''The Faerie Queene''</span>
				<span class='text'>The first three books of ''The Faerie Queene'' were published in 1590, and a second set of three books were published in 1596</span>
				<span class='text'>Spenser originally indicated that he intended the poem to consist of twelve books, so the version of the poem we have today is incomplete</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite this, it remains one of the longest poems in the English language</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = The Cambridge history of early modern English Literature | first1 = David | last1 = Loewenstein | first2 = Janel M | last2 = Mueller | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2003 | ISBN = 0-521-63156-4 | page = 369}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[allegory|allegorical]] work, and can be read (as Spenser presumably intended) on several levels of allegory, including as praise of [[Queen Elizabeth I]]</span>
				<span class='text'> In a completely allegorical context, the poem follows several knights in an examination of several virtues</span>
				<span class='text'> In Spenser's &quot;A Letter of the Authors,&quot; he states that the entire epic poem is &quot;cloudily enwrapped in allegorical devises,&quot; and that the aim behind ''The Faerie Queene'' was to &quot;fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù==Shorter poems==Spenser published numerous relatively short poems in the last decade of the sixteenth century, almost all of which consider love or sorrow</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1591, he published ''[[Complaints]]'', a collection of poems that express complaints in mournful or mocking tones</span>
				<span class='text'>Four years later, in 1595, Spenser published ''Amoretti and Epithalamion''</span>
				<span class='text'>This volume contains eighty-nine sonnets commemorating his courtship of Elizabeth Boyle</span>
				<span class='text'>In &quot;[[Amoretti]],&quot; Spenser uses subtle humour and parody while praising his beloved, reworking Petrarchism in his treatment of longing for a woman</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;[[Epithalamion]],&quot; similar to &quot;[[Amoretti]],&quot; deals in part with the unease in the development of a romantic and sexual relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>It was written for his wedding to his young bride, Elizabeth Boyle</span>
				<span class='text'>The poem consists of 365 long lines, corresponding to the days of the year; 68 short lines, claimed to represent the sum of the 52 weeks, 12 months, and 4 seasons of the annual cycle; and 24 stanzas, corresponding to the diurnal and sidereal hours</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  Some have speculated that the attention to disquiet in general reflects Spenser's personal anxieties at the time, as he was unable to complete his most significant work, ''[[The Faerie Queene]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In the following year Spenser released ''[[Prothalamion]]'', a wedding song written for the daughters of a duke, allegedly in hopes to gain favour in the court</span>

				<span class='text'>Print</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==The Spenserian stanza and sonnet==Spenser used a distinctive verse form, called the [[Spenserian stanza]], in several works, including ''[[The Faerie Queene]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The stanza's main meter is [[iambic pentameter]] with a final line in [[iambic hexameter]] (having six feet or stresses, known as an [[Alexandrine]]), and the rhyme scheme is ababbcbcc</span>
				<span class='text'> He also used his own rhyme scheme for the sonnet</span>
				<span class='text'>In a Spenserian sonnet, the last line of every stanza is linked with the first line of the next one, yielding the rhyme scheme ababbcbccdcdee</span>
				<span class='text'>=Influences==Though Spenser was well read in classical literature, scholars have noted that his poetry does not rehash tradition, but rather is distinctly his</span>
				<span class='text'>This individuality may have resulted, to some extent, from a lack of comprehension of the classics</span>
				<span class='text'>Spenser strove to emulate such ancient Roman poets as [[Virgil]] and [[Ovid]], whom he studied during his schooling, but many of his best-known works are notably divergent from those of his predecessors</span>

				<span class='text'>Print</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The language of his poetry is purposely archaic, reminiscent of earlier works such as ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and ''[[Il Canzoniere]]'' of [[Francesco Petrarca]], whom Spenser greatly admired</span>
				<span class='text'>penser was called a Poets' Poet and was admired by [[John Milton]], [[William Blake]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[John Keats]], [[Lord Byron]], and [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]], among others</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Walter Raleigh]] wrote a dedicatory poem to ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' in 1590, in which he claims to admire and value Spenser's work more so than any other in the English language</span>
				<span class='text'>John Milton in his [[Areopagitica]] called Spenser &quot;our sage and serious poet </span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>Print</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==A View of the Present State of Ireland==In his work ''A Veue of the present state of Irelande'' (1596), Spenser discussed future plans to [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|subjugate Ireland]], the most recent rising, led by [[Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone|Hugh O'Neill]], having demonstrated the futility of previous efforts</span>
				<span class='text'>The work is partly a defence of [[Arthur Grey, 14th Baron Grey de Wilton|Lord Arthur Grey de Wilton]], who was appointed [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]] in 1580, and who greatly influenced Spenser's thinking on Ireland</span>
				<span class='text'>he goal of this piece was to show that Ireland was in great need of reform</span>
				<span class='text'>Spenser believed that &quot;Ireland is a diseased portion of the State, it must first be cured and reformed, before it could be in a position to appreciate the good sound laws and blessings of the nation&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Henley 178&lt;/ref&gt; In ''A View of the Present State of Ireland'', Spenser categorises the ‚Äúevils‚Äù of the Irish people into three prominent categories:  laws, customs, and religion</span>
				<span class='text'> These three elements work together in creating the disruptive and degraded people</span>
				<span class='text'>One example given in the work is the native law system called &quot;[[Brehon Law]]&quot; which trumps the established law given by the English monarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>This system has its own court and way of dealing with infractions</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been passed down through the generations and Spenser views this system as a native backward custom which must be destroyed</span>
				<span class='text'>(Brehon Law methods of dealing with murder by imposing an ''[[√©raic]]'', or fine, on the murderer's whole family particularly horrified the English, in whose Protestant view a murderer should die for his act</span>
				<span class='text'>Spenser wished devoutly that the [[Irish language]] should be eradicated, writing that if children learn Irish before English, &quot;Soe that the speach being Irish, the hart must needes be Irishe; for out of the aboundance of the hart, the tonge speaketh&quot;</span>
