				<span class='text'>ng}}'''James Harold Wilson, Baron Wilson of Rievaulx''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|sep=,|KG|OBE|PC|FRS|FSS}} (11 March 1916{{spaced ndash}}24 May 1995) was a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician who served as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1964 to 1970 and 1974 to 1976</span>
				<span class='text'>irst entering [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945]], Wilson was immediately appointed the [[Parliamentary Secretary|Parliamentary Secretary to the]] [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]] and rose quickly through the ministerial ranks, becoming the [[Secretary for Overseas Trade]] in 1947 and being appointed to the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] just months later as the [[President of the Board of Trade]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, in the [[Shadow Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Labour Shadow Cabinet]], he served first as [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] from 1955 to 1961 and then as the [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] from 1961 to 1963, when he was elected [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] after the sudden death of [[Hugh Gaitskell]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson narrowly won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 election]], going on to win a much increased majority in a snap [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|1966 election]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ilson's [[First Wilson ministry|first period as Prime Minister]] coincided with a period of low unemployment and relative economic prosperity, though also of significant problems with Britain's external balance of payments</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1969 Wilson [[Operation Banner|sent British troops to Northern Ireland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After losing the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]] to [[Edward Heath]], he spent four years as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] before the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After Heath's talks with the Liberals broke down, Wilson returned to power as leader of a minority government until there was a second general election in the autumn, which resulted in a narrow Labour victory</span>
				<span class='text'>A period of economic crisis was now beginning to hit most Western countries, and in 1976 Wilson suddenly announced his resignation as Prime Minister</span>
				<span class='text'>ilson's own approach to [[socialism]] was moderate, with emphasis on increasing opportunity within society, for example through change and expansion within the [[education system]], allied to the technocratic aim of taking better advantage of rapid scientific progress, rather than on the more controversial socialist goal of promoting wider [[public ownership]] of industry</span>
				<span class='text'>He took little action to pursue the Labour Party constitution's stated dedication to such [[nationalisation]], though he did not formally disown it</span>
				<span class='text'>Himself a member of the Labour Party's &quot;soft left&quot;, Wilson joked about leading a Cabinet that was made up mostly of [[Social democracy|social democrats]], comparing himself to a [[Bolshevik]] revolutionary presiding over a [[Tsarist]] cabinet, but there was arguably little to divide him ideologically from the cabinet majority</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The Labour government, 1974–79: political aims and economic reality by Martin Holmes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;labour1945&quot;&gt;The Labour Party since 1945 by Eric Shaw&lt;/ref&gt;Labour Party historians see his years in office as lost opportunities for major reforms</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in keeping with the mood of the 1960s his government sponsored liberal changes in a number of social areas; they were generally not his initiatives</span>
				<span class='text'>These included the liberalisation of laws on censorship, divorce, homosexuality, immigration, and abortion; as well as the abolition of [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|capital punishment]], which was due in part to the initiatives of backbench MPs who had the support of [[Roy Jenkins]] during his time as [[Home Secretary]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Overall, Wilson is seen to have managed a number of difficult political issues with considerable tactical skill, including such potentially divisive issues for his party as the role of public ownership, British membership of the European Community, and the [[Vietnam War]], while continuing to maintain a costly military presence [[East of Suez]]</span>

				<span class='text'>His mother Ethel (''née'' Seddon; 1882–1957) was a schoolteacher before her marriage</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Education===Wilson won a scholarship to attend [[Royds Hall School|Royds Hall Grammar School]], his local [[grammar school]] (now a [[comprehensive school]]) in [[Huddersfield]] in Yorkshire</span>
				<span class='text'>His education was disrupted in October 1930 when he contracted [[typhoid]] fever after drinking contaminated milk on a [[Scouting|Scouts]]' outing</span>
				<span class='text'>It took him three months to recover</span>
				<span class='text'>In December 1930, his father, working as an industrial chemist, was made redundant and it took him nearly two years to find work</span>
				<span class='text'>He moved to [[Spital, Merseyside|Spital]] on the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]], Cheshire in order to do so</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson was educated in the Sixth Form at the [[Wirral Grammar School for Boys]], where he became [[Head Boy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ilson did well at school and, although he missed getting a scholarship, he obtained an exhibition; which, when topped up by a county grant, enabled him to study Modern History at [[Jesus College, Oxford]], from 1934</span>
				<span class='text'>At Oxford, Wilson was moderately active in politics as a member of the Liberal Party but was later influenced by [[G</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A popular [[urban myth]] at Oxford University states that Wilson's grade in his final examination was the highest ever recorded up to that date</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough Wilson had two abortive attempts at an [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls]] Fellowship, he continued in academia, becoming one of the youngest Oxford University dons of the century at the age of 21</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a lecturer in [[Economic History]] at [[New College, Oxford|New College]] from 1937, and a Research Fellow at [[University College, Oxford|University College]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Marriage===On New Year's Day 1940, in the chapel of [[Mansfield College, Oxford]], he married [[Mary Wilson, Lady Wilson of Rievaulx|Mary Baldwin]] who remained his wife until his death</span>

				<span class='text'>For much of this time, he was a research assistant to [[William Beveridge]], the Master of the College, working on the issues of unemployment and the trade cycle</span>
				<span class='text'>He later became a statistician and economist for the coal industry</span>

				<span class='text'>As [[President of the Board of Trade]], he was the driving force behind the [[Statistics of Trade Act 1947]], which is still the authority governing most economic statistics in [[UK|Great Britain]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was instrumental as Prime Minister in appointing [[Claus Moser]] as head of the [[Central Statistical Office, UK|Central Statistical Office]], and was president of the [[Royal Statistical Society]] in 1972–73</span>
				<span class='text'>=Member of Parliament (1945–64)==As the war drew to an end, he searched for a seat to fight at the impending general election</span>
				<span class='text'>He was selected for the constituency of [[Ormskirk (UK Parliament constituency)|Ormskirk]], then held by [[Stephen King-Hall]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson agreed to be adopted as the candidate immediately rather than delay until the election was called, and was therefore compelled to resign from his position in the Civil Service</span>
				<span class='text'>He served as [[Praelector]] in Economics at University College between his resignation and his election to the House of Commons</span>
				<span class='text'>He also used this time to write ''A New Deal for Coal'', which used his wartime experience to argue for nationalisation of the coal mines on the grounds of the improved efficiency he predicted would ensue</span>
				<span class='text'>n the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]], Wilson won his seat in the Labour landslide</span>
				<span class='text'>To his surprise, he was immediately appointed to the government by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Clement Attlee]] as [[Parliamentary Secretary|Parliamentary Secretary to the]] [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Two years later, he became [[Secretary for Overseas Trade]], in which capacity he made several official trips to the [[Soviet Union]] to negotiate supply contracts</span>
				<span class='text'>n the general election of 1950, his Ormskirk constituency was significantly altered and he was narrowly elected for the new seat of [[Huyton (UK Parliament constituency)|Huyton]] near Liverpool, where he served for 33 years until 1983</span>

				<span class='text'>He took a lead in abolishing some wartime rationing, which he referred to as a &quot;bonfire of controls&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>His role in internal debates during the summer of 1949 over whether or not to devalue sterling, in which he was perceived to have played both sides of the issue, tarnished his reputation in both political and official circles</span>

				<span class='text'>After the Labour Party lost the [[UK general election, 1951|1951 election]], he became the Chairman of Keep Left, Bevan's political group, but soon after he began to distance himself from Bevan</span>
				<span class='text'>==Shadow Cabinet, 1951–64===Wilson was appointed to the [[Shadow Cabinet (UK)|Shadow Cabinet]] by Labour Party Leader [[Hugh Gaitskell]] in 1955 as [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]], and he proved to be very effective</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his procedural moves caused a substantial delay to the progress of the Government's Finance Bill in 1955, and his speeches as Shadow Chancellor from 1956 were widely praised for their clarity and wit</span>

				<span class='text'>As well as his role as Shadow Chancellor, he conducted an inquiry into the Labour Party's organisation following its defeat in the [[UK general election, 1955|1955 general election]], which compared Labour's organisation to an antiquated &quot;penny farthing&quot;  bicycle, and made various recommendations for improvements</span>
				<span class='text'>Unusually, Wilson combined the job of Chairman of the House of Commons' [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] with that of Shadow Chancellor from 1959, holding that position until 1963</span>
				<span class='text'>ilson steered a course in intra-party matters in the 1950s and early 1960s that left him neither fully accepted nor trusted by the left and the right in the Labour Party</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his earlier association with the left-wing [[Aneurin Bevan]], in 1955 he backed Gaitskell, considered the right-of-centre candidate in internal Labour Party terms, against Bevan for the party leadership</span>

				<span class='text'>During 1965, by-election losses reduced the government's majority to a single seat; but in [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|March 1966]] Wilson took the gamble of calling another general election</span>

				<span class='text'>==Domestic affairs=======Economic policies====In economic terms, Wilson's first three years in office were dominated by an ultimately doomed effort to stave off the devaluation of the pound</span>
				<span class='text'>He inherited an unusually large external deficit on the [[balance of trade]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This partly reflected the preceding government's expansive fiscal policy in the run-up to the 1964 election, and the incoming Wilson team tightened the fiscal stance in response</span>
				<span class='text'>Many British economists advocated devaluation, but Wilson resisted, reportedly in part out of concern that Labour, which had previously devalued sterling in 1949, would become tagged as &quot;the party of devaluation&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Wilson was much criticised for a broadcast in which he assured listeners that the &quot;pound in your pocket&quot; had not lost its value</span>
				<span class='text'>It was widely forgotten that his next sentence had been &quot;prices will rise&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Economic performance did show some improvement after the devaluation, as economists had predicted</span>
				<span class='text'>The devaluation, with accompanying austerity measures, successfully restored the balance of payments to surplus by 1969</span>
				<span class='text'>This unexpectedly turned into a small deficit again in 1970</span>
				<span class='text'>The bad figures were announced just before polling in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]], and are often cited as one of the reasons for Labour's defeat</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt;A main theme of Wilson's economic approach was to place enhanced emphasis on &quot;indicative [[economic planning]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He created a new [[Secretary of State for Economic Affairs|Department of Economic Affairs]] to generate ambitious targets that were in themselves supposed to help stimulate investment and growth (the government also created a [[Minister of Technology|Ministry of Technology]] (shortened to Mintech) to support the modernisation of industry)</span>
				<span class='text'>The DEA itself was in part intended to serve as an expansionary counter-weight to what Labour saw as the conservative influence of the Treasury, though the appointment of Wilson's deputy, George Brown, as the Minister in charge of the DEA was something of a two-edged sword, in view of Brown's reputation for erratic conduct; in any case the government's decision over its first three years to defend sterling's parity with traditional deflationary measures ran counter to hopes for an expansionist push for growth</span>
				<span class='text'>Though now out of fashion, the faith in indicative planning as a pathway to growth,&lt;ref&gt;An influential study at the time, [[Andrew Shonfield]]'s ''Modern Capitalism'' (OUP, 1965), provided intellectual backing for the belief that indicative planning largely underlay the superior growth performance of France and Germany compared to the UK</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; embodied in the DEA and Mintech, was at the time by no means confined to the Labour Party – Wilson built on foundations that had been laid by his Conservative predecessors, in the shape, for example, of the [[National Economic Development Council]] (known as &quot;Neddy&quot;) and its regional counterparts (the &quot;little Neddies&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot; /&gt; Government intervention in industry was greatly enhanced, with the National Economic Development Office greatly strengthened, with the number of &quot;little Neddies&quot; was increased, from eight in 1964 to twenty-one in 1970</span>
				<span class='text'>The government's policy of selective economic intervention was later characterised by the establishment of a new super-ministry of technology, under [[Tony Benn]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceN&quot;&gt;The Labour Government 1964–70 By Brian Lapping&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Nixon and Wilson</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Harold and Mary Wilson with [[Richard Nixon|Richard]] and [[Pat Nixon]] at the White House in 1970</span>
				<span class='text'>]The continued relevance of industrial nationalisation (a centrepiece of the post-War Labour government's programme) had been a key point of contention in Labour's internal struggles of the 1950s and early 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson's predecessor as leader, [[Hugh Gaitskell]], had tried in 1960 to tackle the controversy head-on, with a proposal to expunge [[Clause Four]] (the public ownership clause) from the party's constitution, but had been forced to climb down</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson took a characteristically more subtle approach</span>
				<span class='text'>He threw the party's left wing a symbolic bone with the renationalisation of the steel industry, but otherwise left Clause Four formally in the constitution but in practice on the shelf</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt;Wilson made periodic attempts to mitigate inflation through wage-price controls, better known in Britain as &quot;prices and [[incomes policy]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt; (as with indicative planning, such controls—though now generally out of favour – were widely adopted at that time by governments of different ideological complexions, including the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] administration in the United States)</span>
				<span class='text'>Partly as a result of this reliance, the government tended to find itself repeatedly injected into major industrial disputes, with late-night &quot;beer and sandwiches at Number Ten&quot; an almost routine culmination to such episodes</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the most damaging of the numerous strikes during Wilson's periods in office was a six-week stoppage by the [[National Union of Seamen]], beginning shortly after Wilson's [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|re-election in 1966]], and conducted, he claimed, by &quot;politically motivated men&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>ith public frustration over strikes mounting, Wilson's government in 1969 proposed a series of changes to the legal basis for industrial relations (labour law), which were outlined in a White Paper &quot;[[In Place of Strife]]&quot; put forward by the Employment Secretary [[Barbara Castle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Following a confrontation with the [[Trades Union Congress]], which strongly opposed the proposals, and internal dissent from [[Home Secretary]] [[James Callaghan]], the government substantially backed-down from its intentions</span>
				<span class='text'>Some elements of these changes were subsequently to be enacted (in modified form) during the premiership of [[Margaret Thatcher]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt;Wilson's government made a variety of changes to the tax system</span>
				<span class='text'>Largely under the influence of the [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born economists [[Nicholas Kaldor]] and [[Thomas Balogh]], an idiosyncratic [[Selective Employment Tax]] (SET) was introduced that was designed to tax employment in the service sectors while subsidising employment in manufacturing (the rationale proposed by its economist authors derived largely from claims about potential economies of scale and technological progress, but Wilson in his memoirs stressed the tax's revenue-raising potential)</span>
				<span class='text'>The SET did not long survive the return of a Conservative government</span>
				<span class='text'>Of longer term significance, [[Capital Gains Tax]] (CGT) was introduced across the UK on 6 April 1965</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1974, three weeks after forming a new government, Wilson's new chancellor Denis Healey partially reversed the 1971 reduction in the top rate of tax from 90% to 75%, increasing it to 83% in his first budget, which came into law in April 1974</span>
				<span class='text'>This applied to incomes over £20,000 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|20000|1974|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK}}, and combined with a 15% surcharge on 'un-earned' income (investments and dividends) could add to a 98% marginal rate of personal income tax</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1974, as many as 750,000 people were liable to pay the top-rate of income tax</span>

				<span class='text'>These dealt with the death penalty, homosexual acts, abortion,  censorship and the voting age</span>
				<span class='text'> There were new restrictions on immigration</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Education===={{main|First Wilson ministry#Education}}Education held special significance for a socialist of Wilson's generation, in view of its role in both opening up opportunities for children from working-class backgrounds and enabling Britain to seize the potential benefits of scientific advances</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the first Wilson government, for the first time in British history, more money was allocated to education than to defence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;The Decade of Disillusion: British Politics in the Sixties, edited by David Mckie and Chris Cook&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson continued the rapid creation of new universities, in line with the recommendations of the [[Robbins Report]], a bipartisan policy already in train when Labour took power</span>
				<span class='text'>ilson promoted the concept of an [[Open University]], to give adults who had missed out on tertiary education a second chance through part-time study and distance learning</span>
				<span class='text'>His political commitment included assigning implementation responsibility to [[Jennie Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge|Baroness Lee]], the widow of [[Aneurin Bevan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ponting&quot;&gt;Breach of Promise – Labour in Power, 1964–70 by Clive Ponting&lt;/ref&gt; By 1981, 45,000 students had received degrees through the Open University</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ponting&quot;/&gt; Money was also channelled into local-authority run colleges of education</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceN&quot;/&gt;Wilson's record on secondary education is, by contrast, highly controversial</span>
				<span class='text'> Pressure grew for the abolition of the selective principle underlying the &quot;[[eleven plus]]&quot;, and replacement with [[Comprehensive school]]s which would serve the full range of children (see the article [[Debates on the grammar school]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Comprehensive education became Labour Party policy</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1966 to 1970, the proportion of children in comprehensive schools increased from about 10% to over 30%</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Changing party policy in Britain: an introduction by Richard Kelly&lt;/ref&gt;Labour pressed local authorities to convert grammar schools into comprehensives</span>
				<span class='text'>Conversion continued on a large scale during the subsequent Conservative  [[Edward Heath|Heath]] administration, although the Secretary of State, [[Margaret Thatcher]], ended the compulsion of local governments to convert</span>
				<span class='text'> major controversy that arose during Wilson's first government was the decision that the government could not fulfil its long-held promise to raise the school leaving age to 16, because of the investment required in infrastructure, such as extra classrooms and teachers</span>
				<span class='text'>verall, public expenditure on education rose as a proportion of GNP from 4</span>
				<span class='text'>% in 1964 to 5</span>
				<span class='text'>% in 1968, and the number of teachers in training increased by more than a third between 1964 and 1967</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;A Short History Of The Labour Party by Henry Pelling&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of students staying on at school after the age of sixteen increased similarly, and the student population increased by over 10% each year</span>
				<span class='text'>Pupil-teacher ratios were also steadily reduced</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result of the first Wilson government's educational policies, opportunities for working-class children were improved, while overall access to education in 1970 was broader than in 1964</span>

				<span class='text'>Atkinson]], social security received much more attention from the first Wilson government than it did during the previous thirteen years of Conservative government</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;inequality&quot; /&gt; Following its victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 general election]], Wilson's government began to increase social benefits</span>
				<span class='text'>Prescription charges for medicines were abolished immediately, while pensions were raised to a record 21% of average male industrial wages</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1966, the system of [[National Assistance]] (a social assistance scheme for the poor) was overhauled and renamed [[Supplementary Benefit]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The means test was replaced with a statement of income, and benefit rates for pensioners (the great majority of claimants) were increased, granting them a real gain in income</span>
				<span class='text'>Before the 1966 election, the widow's pension was tripled</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to austerity measures following an economic crisis, [[prescription charges]] were re-introduced in 1968 as an alternative to cutting the hospital building programme, although those sections of the population who were most in need (including supplementary benefit claimants, the long-term sick, children, and pensioners) were exempted from charges</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;Labour's First Century by Duncan Tanner, Pat Thane, and Nick Tiratsoo&lt;/ref&gt;The widow's earning rule was also abolished,&lt;ref name=&quot;ponting&quot; /&gt; while a range of new social benefits was introduced</span>
				<span class='text'>An Act was passed which replaced National Assistance with Supplementary Benefits</span>
				<span class='text'>The new Act laid down that people who satisfied its conditions were entitled to these noncontributory benefits</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike the National Assistance scheme, which operated like state charity for the worst-off, the new Supplementary Benefits scheme was a right of every citizen who found himself or herself in severe difficulties</span>
				<span class='text'>Those persons over the retirement age with no means who were considered to be unable to live on the basic pension (which provided less than what the government deemed as necessary for subsistence) became entitled to a &quot;long term&quot; allowance of an extra few shillings a week</span>
				<span class='text'>Some simplification of the procedure for claiming benefits was also introduced</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceN&quot;/&gt; From 1966, an exceptionally severe disablement allowance was added “for those claimants receiving constant attendance allowance which was paid to those with the higher or intermediate rates of constant attendance allowance and who were exceptionally severely disabled</span>

				<span class='text'>% in 1964 to about 5% in 1969</span>
				<span class='text'>This additional expenditure provided for an energetic revival of a policy of building health centres for GPs, extra pay for doctors who served in areas particularly short of them, a significant growth in hospital staffing, and a significant increase in a hospital building programme</span>
				<span class='text'>Far more money was spent each year on the NHS than under the 1951–64 Conservative governments, while much more effort was put into modernising and reorganising the health service</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceN&quot;/&gt; Stronger central and regional organisations were established for bulk purchase of hospital supplies, while some efforts were made to reduce inequalities in standards of care</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, the government increased the intake to medical schools</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;inequality&quot; /&gt;The [[1966 Doctor's Charter]] introduced allowances for rent and ancillary staff, significantly increased the pay scales, and changed the structure of payments to reflect &quot;both qualifications of doctors and the form of their practices, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>group practice</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; These changes not only led to higher morale, but also resulted in the increased use of ancillary staff and nursing attachments, a growth in the number of health centres and group practices, and a boost in the modernisation of practices in terms of equipment, appointment systems, and buildings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;byrne1&quot;/&gt; The charter introduced a new system of payment for GPs, with refunds for surgery, rents, ands rates, to ensure that the costs of improving his surgery did not diminish the doctor's income, together with allowances for the greater part of ancillary staff costs</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, a Royal Commission on medical education was set up, partly to draw up ideas for training GPS (since these doctors, the largest group of all doctors in the country, had previously not received any special training, &quot;merely being those who, at the end of their pre-doctoral courses, did not go on for further training in any speciality)</span>

				<span class='text'>A National Freight Corporation was also established to provide integrated rail freight and road services</span>
				<span class='text'>Public expenditure on roads steadily increased and stricter safety precautions were introduced, such as the [[breathalyser test]] for drunken driving,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; under the 1967 Road Traffic Act</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceN&quot;/&gt;  The Transport Act gave a much needed financial boost to [[British Rail]], treating them like they were a company which had become bankrupt but could now, under new management, carry on debt-free</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Labour 1968&quot;/&gt;====Regional development====Encouragement of regional development was given increased attention under the First Wilson Government, with the aim of narrowing economic dispratiies between the various regions</span>
				<span class='text'>A policy was introduced in 1965 whereby any new government organisation should be established outside London and in 1967 the government decided to give preference to development areas</span>
				<span class='text'>A few government departments were also moved out of London, with the [[Royal Mint]] moved to [[South Wales]], the Giro and Inland Revenue to [[Bootle]], and the Motor Tax Office to [[Swansea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;beckerman&quot;&gt;The Labour government's Economic record: 1964–1970, edited by Wilfred Beckerman&lt;/ref&gt; A new Special Development Status was also introduced in 1967 to provide even higher levels of assistance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ponting&quot; /&gt; In 1966, five development areas (covering half the population in the UK) were established, while subsidies were provided for employers recruiting new employees in the Development Areas</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt; A Highlands and Islands Development Board was also set up to “re-invigorate” the north of Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Labour 1968&quot;/&gt;The [[Industrial Development Act 1966]] changed the name of Development Districts (parts of the country with higher levels of unemployment than the national average and which governments sought to encourage greater investment in) to Development Areas and increased the percentage of the workforce covered by development schemes from 15% to 20%, which mainly affected rural areas in [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Tax allowances were replaced by grants in order to extend coverage to include firms which were not making a profit, and in 1967 a Regional Employment Premium was introduced</span>
				<span class='text'>Whereas the existing schemes tended to favour capital-intensive projects, this aimed for the first time at increasing employment in depressed areas</span>
				<span class='text'>Set at £1</span>
				<span class='text'>0 a man per week and guaranteed for seven years, the Regional Employment Premium subsidised all manufacturing industry (though not services) in Development Areas</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ponting&quot;/&gt;Regional unemployment differentials were narrowed, and spending on regional infrastructure was significantly increased</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1965–66 and 1969–70, yearly expenditure on new construction (including power stations, roads, schools, hospitals and housing) rose by 41% in the United Kingdom as a whole</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsidies were also provided for various industries (such as [[shipbuilding]] in [[Clydeside]]), which helped to prevent a number of job losses</span>
				<span class='text'>It is estimated that, between 1964 and 1970, 45,000 government jobs were created outside London, 21,000 of which were located in the Development Areas</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;beckerman&quot; /&gt; The Local Employment Act, passed in March 1970, embodied the government's proposals for assistance to 54 &quot;intermediate&quot; employment exchange areas not classified as full &quot;development&quot; areas</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1970, the unemployment rate in development areas was 1</span>
				<span class='text'>7 times the national average, compared to 2</span>
				<span class='text'>1 times in 1964</span>
				<span class='text'>Although national rates of unemployment were higher in 1970 than in the early 1960s, unemployment rates in the development areas were lower and had not increased for three years</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ponting&quot; /&gt; Altogether, the impact of the first Wilson government's regional development policies was such that, according to one historian, the period 1963 to 1970 represented &quot;the most prolonged, most intensive, and most successful attack ever launched on regional problems in Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;/&gt;====Urban renewal===={{main|First Wilson ministry#Urban renewal}}A number of subsidies were allocated to local authorities faced with acute areas of severe poverty (or other social problems)</span>

				<span class='text'>Local authorities could declare 'general improvement areas' in which they would be able to buy up land and houses, and spend environmental improvement grants</span>
				<span class='text'>On the same basis, taking geographical areas of need, a package was developed by the government which resembled a miniature poverty programme</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;cook&quot;&gt;The decade of disillusion: British politics in the '60s by David McKie and Chris Cook&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1967, the government decided to pour money into what the Plowden Committee defined as Educational Priority Areas, poverty-stricken areas where children were environmentally deprived</span>
				<span class='text'>A number of poor inner-city areas were subsequently granted EPA status (despite concerns that Local Education Authorities would be unable to finance Educational Priority Areas)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;taylor&quot; /&gt; From 1968 to 1970, 150 new schools were built under the educational priority programme</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;inequality&quot; /&gt;====International development====A new Ministry of Overseas Development was established, with its greatest success at the time being the introduction of interest-free loans for the poorest countries</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ponting&quot; /&gt; The Minister of Overseas Development, [[Barbara Castle]], set a standard in interest relief on loans to developing nations which resulted in changes to the loan policies of many donor countries, &quot;a significant shift in the conduct of rich white nations to poor brown ones</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Loans were introduced to developing countries on terms that were more favourable to them than those given by governments of all other developed countries at that time</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, Castle was instrumental in setting up an Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex to devise ways of tackling global socio-economic inequalities</span>
				<span class='text'>Overseas aid, however, bore a major brunt of the austerity measures introduced by the first Wilson government in its last few years in office, with British aid as a percentage of GNP falling from 0</span>
				<span class='text'>3% in 1964 to 0</span>
				<span class='text'>9% in 1969</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceN&quot;/&gt;====Taxation====Various changes were also made to the tax system which benefited workers on low and middle incomes</span>
				<span class='text'>Married couples with low incomes benefited from the increases in the single personal allowance and marriage allowance</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1965, the regressive allowance for national insurance contributions was abolished and the single personal allowance, marriage allowance and wife's earned income relief were increased</span>
				<span class='text'>These allowances were further increased in the tax years 1969–70 and 1970–71</span>
				<span class='text'>Increases in the age exemption and dependant relative's income limits benefited the low-income elderly</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;inequality&quot; /&gt;1968 saw the introduction of aggregation of the investment income of unmarried minors with the income of their parents</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Michael Meacher, this change put an end to a previous inequity whereby two families, in otherwise identical circumstances, paid differing amounts of tax &quot;simply because in one case the child possessed property transferred to it by a grandparent, while in the other case the grandparent's identical property was inherited by the parent</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;inequality&quot; /&gt;In the 1969 budget, income tax was abolished for about 1 million of the lowest paid and reduced for a further 600,000 people,&lt;ref name=&quot;Crossman&quot; /&gt; while in the government's last budget (introduced in 1970), two million small taxpayers were exempted from paying any income tax altogether</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Poverty in Britain, 1900–1965 by Ian Gazeley&lt;/ref&gt; These achievements were mainly brought about by several increases in social welfare benefits,&lt;ref&gt;Understanding Social Policy by Michael James Hill&lt;/ref&gt; such as supplementary benefit, pensions and family allowances, the latter of which were doubled between 1964 and 1970 (although most of the increase in family allowances did not come about until 1968)</span>

				<span class='text'>Greater progressivity was introduced in the tax system, with greater emphasis on direct (income-based) as opposed to indirect (typically expenditure-based) taxation as a means of raising revenue, with the amount raised by the former increasing twice as much as that of the latter</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;socialists1&quot;/&gt;As noted by Paul Whiteley, pensions, sickness, unemployment, and supplementary benefits went up more in real terms under the First Wilson Government than under the preceding Conservative administration:“To compare the Conservative period of office with the Labour period, we can use the changes in benefits per year as a rough estimate of comparative performance</span>
				<span class='text'>For the Conservatives and Labour respectively increases in supplementary benefits per year were 3</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt;Between 1964 and 1968, cash benefits rose as a percentage of income for all households but more so for poorer than for wealthier households</span>
				<span class='text'>As noted by the economist Michael Stewart,&quot;it seems indisputable that the high priority the Labour Government gave to expenditure on education and the health service had a favourable effect on income distribution</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;beckerman&quot; /&gt;For a family with two children in the income range £676 to £816 per annum, cash benefits rose from 4% of income in 1964 to 22% in 1968, compared with a change from 1% to 2% for a similar family in the income range £2,122 to £2,566 over the same period</span>
				<span class='text'>For benefits in kind the changes over the same period for similar families were from 21% to 29% for lower income families and from 9% to 10% for higher income families</span>
				<span class='text'>When taking into account all benefits, taxes and Government expenditures on social services, the first Wilson government succeeded in bringing about a reduction in income inequality</span>
				<span class='text'>As noted by the historian [[Kenneth O</span>
				<span class='text'>Morgan]],&quot;In the long term, therefore, fortified by increases in supplementary and other benefits under the Crossman regime in 1968–70, the welfare state had made some impact, almost by inadvertence, on social inequality and the maldistribution of real income&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ponting&quot; /&gt; These measures had a major impact on the living standards of low-income Britons, with disposable incomes rising faster for low-income groups than for high-income groups during the course of the 1960s</span>

				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;In May 1974, when back in office as leader of a minority government, Wilson condemned the [[Unionists (Ireland)|Unionist]]-controlled [[Ulster Workers Council Strike]] as a &quot;[[sectarianism|sectarian]] strike&quot;, which was &quot;being done for sectarian purposes having no relation to this century but only to the seventeenth century&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>However he refused to pressure a reluctant [[British Army]] to face down the [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] paramilitaries who were intimidating utility workers</span>
				<span class='text'>In a televised speech later, he referred to the loyalist strikers and their supporters as &quot;spongers&quot; who expected Britain to pay for their lifestyles</span>
				<span class='text'>The strike was eventually successful in breaking the power-sharing [[Northern Ireland]] executive</span>
				<span class='text'>n 11 September 2008, BBC Radio Four's ''Document'' programme claimed to have unearthed a secret plan – codenamed ''Doomsday'' – which proposed to cut all of the United Kingdom's constitutional ties with Northern Ireland and transform the province into an independent dominion</span>
				<span class='text'>''Document'' went on to claim that the Doomsday plan was devised mainly by Wilson and was kept a closely guarded secret</span>
				<span class='text'>The plan then allegedly lost momentum, due in part, it was claimed, to warnings made by both the then Foreign Secretary, James Callaghan, and the then Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs [[Garret FitzGerald]] who admitted the 12,000-strong Irish army would be unable to deal with the ensuing civil war</span>

				<span class='text'>He claimed that he had always planned on resigning at the age of 60, and that he was physically and mentally exhausted</span>
				<span class='text'>As early as the late 1960s, he had been telling intimates, like his doctor Sir Joseph Stone (later [[Lord Stone of Hendon]]), that he did not intend to serve more than eight or nine years as Prime Minister</span>
				<span class='text'>Roy Jenkins has suggested that Wilson may have been motivated partly by the distaste for politics felt by his loyal and long-suffering wife, Mary</span>

				<span class='text'>=Political style==Wilson regarded himself as a &quot;man of the people&quot; and did much to promote this image, contrasting himself with the stereotypical aristocratic conservatives who had preceded him</span>

				<span class='text'>Eschewing continental holidays, he returned every summer with his family to the [[Isles of Scilly]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His first general election victory relied heavily on associating these down-to-earth attributes with a sense that the UK urgently needed to modernise, after &quot;thirteen years of Tory mis-rule&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>These characteristics were exaggerated in ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye's]]'' satirical column &quot;[[Prime Minister parodies (Private Eye)|Mrs Wilson's Diary]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>ilson exhibited his populist touch in June 1965 when he had [[the Beatles]] honoured with the award of [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (such awards are officially bestowed by The Queen but are nominated by the Prime Minister of the day)</span>
				<span class='text'>The award was popular with young people and contributed to a sense that the Prime Minister was &quot;in touch&quot; with the younger generation</span>
				<span class='text'>There were some protests by conservatives and elderly members of the military who were earlier recipients of the award, but such protesters were in the minority</span>
				<span class='text'>Critics claimed that Wilson acted to solicit votes for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|next general election]] (which took place less than a year later), but defenders noted that, since the minimum voting age at that time was 21, this was hardly likely to impact many of the Beatles' fans who at that time were predominantly teenagers</span>
				<span class='text'>It cemented Wilson's image as a modernistic leader and linked him to the burgeoning pride in the 'New Britain' typified by the Beatles</span>
				<span class='text'>The Beatles mentioned Wilson rather negatively, naming both him and his opponent Edward Heath in [[George Harrison]]'s song &quot;[[Taxman]]&quot;, the opener to 1966's ''[[Revolver (The Beatles album)|Revolver]]''—recorded and released after the MBEs</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1967, Wilson had a different interaction with a musical ensemble</span>
				<span class='text'>He sued the pop group [[the Move]] for libel after the band's manager [[Tony Secunda]] published a promotional postcard for the single &quot;[[Flowers in the Rain]]&quot;, featuring a caricature depicting Wilson in bed with his female assistant, [[Marcia Williams]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Gossip had hinted at an improper relationship, though these rumours were never substantiated</span>
				<span class='text'>Wilson won the case, and all royalties from the song (composed by Move leader [[Roy Wood]]) were assigned in perpetuity to a charity of Wilson's choosing</span>
				<span class='text'>ilson coined the term '[[Selsdon Man]]' to refer to the anti-interventionist policies of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] leader [[Edward Heath]], developed at a policy retreat held at the [[Selsdon]] Park Hotel in early 1970</span>
				<span class='text'>This phrase, intended to evoke the 'primitive throwback' qualities of anthropological discoveries such as [[Piltdown Man]] and [[Homo erectus|Swanscombe Man]], was part of a British political tradition of referring to political trends by suffixing 'man'</span>
				<span class='text'>Other memorable phrases attributed to Wilson include &quot;the white heat of the [technological] revolution&quot;, and &quot;a week is a long time in politics&quot;, meaning that political fortunes can change extremely rapidly</span>
				<span class='text'>In his broadcast after the 1967 devaluation of the pound, Wilson said: &quot;This does not mean that the pound here in Britain – in your pocket or purse – is worth any less&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;, and the phrase &quot;the pound in your pocket&quot; subsequently took on a life of its own</span>
				<span class='text'>==Reputation===Despite his successes and one-time popularity, Harold Wilson's reputation took a long time to recover from the low ebb reached immediately following his second premiership</span>
				<span class='text'>Some accuse him of undue deviousness, some claim he did not do enough to modernise the Labour Party's policy positions on issues such as the respective roles of the state and the market or the reform of industrial relations</span>
				<span class='text'>This line of argument partly blames Wilson for the civil unrest of the late 1970s (during Britain's [[Winter of Discontent]]), and for the electoral success of the Conservative party and its ensuing 18-year rule</span>
				<span class='text'>His supporters argue that Wilson's skilful management (on issues such as nationalisation, Europe and Vietnam) allowed an otherwise fractious party to stay politically united and govern</span>
				<span class='text'>This co-existence did not long survive his leadership, and the factionalism that followed contributed greatly to the Labour Party's electoral weakness during the 1980s</span>
				<span class='text'>The reinvention of the Labour Party would take the better part of two decades, at the hands of [[Neil Kinnock]], [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] and – electorally, most conclusively – [[Tony Blair]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1964, when Wilson took office, the mainstream of informed opinion (in all the main political parties, in academia and the media, etc</span>
				<span class='text'> strongly favoured the type of technocratic, &quot;[[indicative planning]]&quot; approach that Wilson endeavoured to implement</span>
				<span class='text'>Radical market-orientated reforms, of the kind eventually adopted by [[Margaret Thatcher]], were in the mid-1960s backed only by a 'fringe' of enthusiasts (such as the leadership of the later-influential [[Institute of Economic Affairs]]), and had almost no representation at senior levels even of the Conservative Party</span>
				<span class='text'>Fifteen years later, disillusionment with Britain's weak economic performance and troubled industrial relations, combined with active spadework by figures such as Sir [[Keith Joseph]], had helped to make a radical market programme politically feasible for Thatcher (which was in turn to influence the subsequent Labour leadership, especially under Blair)</span>
				<span class='text'>n opinion poll in September 2011 found that Wilson came in third place when respondents were asked to name the best post-war Labour Party leader</span>
				<span class='text'>He was beaten only by John Smith and Tony Blair</span>

				<span class='text'>The approach was made by [[Cecil Harmsworth King]], the chairman of the [[IPC Media|International Publishing Corporation]] (IPC), which published the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' newspaper</span>
				<span class='text'>Hough bases his account on conversations with the ''Mirror'''s long-time editor [[Hugh Cudlipp]], supplemented by the recollections of the scientist [[Solly Zuckerman]] and of Mountbatten's valet, William Evans</span>
				<span class='text'>Cudlipp arranged for Mountbatten to meet King on 8 May 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>King had long yearned to play a more central political role, and had personal grudges against Wilson (including Wilson's refusal to propose King for the hereditary earldom that King coveted)</span>
				<span class='text'>He had already failed in an earlier attempt to replace Wilson with [[James Callaghan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With Britain's continuing economic difficulties and industrial strife in the 1960s, King convinced himself that Wilson's government was heading towards collapse</span>
				<span class='text'>He thought that Mountbatten, as a member of the Royal Family and a former [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]], would command public support as leader of a non-democratic &quot;emergency&quot; government</span>
				<span class='text'>Mountbatten insisted that his friend, Zuckerman, be present (Zuckerman says that he was urged to attend by Mountbatten's son-in-law, [[John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Brabourne|Lord Brabourne]], who worried King would lead Mountbatten astray)</span>

				<span class='text'>he question of how serious a threat to democracy may have existed during these years continues to be contentious—a key point at issue being who of any consequence would have been ready to move beyond grumbling about the government (or spreading rumours) to actively taking unconstitutional action</span>
				<span class='text'>Cecil King himself was an inveterate schemer but an inept actor on the political stage</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps significantly, when King penned a strongly worded editorial against Wilson for the ''Daily Mirror'' two days after his abortive meeting with Mountbatten, the unanimous reaction of IPC's directors was to fire him with immediate effect from his position as Chairman</span>
				<span class='text'>King's resignation was considered a serious enough matter for the BBC to have senior journalist William Hardcastle announce it in a news flash</span>
				<span class='text'>More fundamentally, [[Denis Healey]], who served for six years as Wilson's [[Secretary of State for Defence]], has argued that actively serving senior British military officers would not have been prepared to overthrow a constitutionally elected government</span>
				<span class='text'>y the time of his resignation, Wilson's own perceptions of any threat may very well have been exacerbated by the onset of [[Alzheimer's disease]]; his inherent tendency to chariness was undoubtedly stoked by some in his inner circle, including [[Marcia Falkender, Baroness Falkender|Marcia Williams]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He reportedly shared with a surprised [[George H</span>
				<span class='text'>W</span>
				<span class='text'>Bush]], at the time the Director of the CIA, his fear that some of the portraits in 10 Downing Street (specifically including Gladstone's portrait in the Cabinet Room) concealed listening devices being used to bug his discussions</span>
