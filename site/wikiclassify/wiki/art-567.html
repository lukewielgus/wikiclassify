				<span class='text'>Gropius could not draw, and was dependent on collaborators and partner-interpreters throughout his career</span>
				<span class='text'>In school he hired an assistant to complete his homework for him</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1908, after studying architecture in [[Munich]] and [[Berlin]] for four semesters, Gropius joined the office of the renowned architect and industrial designer [[Peter Behrens]], one of the first members of the utilitarian school</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1910 Gropius left the firm of Behrens and together with fellow employee [[Adolf Meyer (architect)|Adolf Meyer]] established a practice in Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>Together they share credit for one of the seminal modernist buildings created during this period: the [[Fagus Factory|Faguswerk]] in [[Alfeld (Leine)|Alfeld-an-der-Leine, Germany]], a shoe [[last]] factory</span>
				<span class='text'> Although Gropius and Meyer only designed the facade, the glass curtain walls of this building demonstrated both the modernist principle that [[Form follows function|form reflects function]] and Gropius's concern with providing healthful conditions for the working class</span>
				<span class='text'>The factory is now regarded as one of the crucial founding monuments of European modernism</span>
				<span class='text'>Gropius was commissioned in 1913 to design a car for the Prussian Railroad Locomotive Works in K√∂nigsberg</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1913, Gropius published an article about &quot;The Development of Industrial Buildings,&quot; which included about a dozen photographs of factories and [[grain elevators]] in North America</span>
				<span class='text'>A very influential text, this article had a strong influence on other European modernists, including [[Le Corbusier]] and Erich Mendelsohn, both of whom reprinted Gropius's grain elevator pictures between 1920 and 1930</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1923, Gropius designed his famous door handles, now considered an icon of 20th-century design and often listed as one of the most influential designs to emerge from Bauhaus</span>
