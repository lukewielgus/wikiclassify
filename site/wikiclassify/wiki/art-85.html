				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;) ({{OldStyleDate|10 February|1890|29 January}}{{spaced ndash}}30 May 1960) was a Russian poet, novelist, and literary translator</span>
				<span class='text'>In his native Russian, Pasternak's first book of poems, ''My Sister, Life'' (1917), is one of the most influential collections ever published in the [[Russian language]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pasternak's translations of [[stage play]]s by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderon]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] remain very popular with Russian audiences</span>
				<span class='text'>utside Russia, Pasternak is best known as the author of ''[[Doctor Zhivago (novel)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' (1957), a novel which takes place between the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] and the [[First World War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to the novel's independent-minded stance on the [[socialist state]], ''Doctor Zhivago'' was rejected for publication in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the instigation of [[Giangiacomo Feltrinelli]], ''Doctor Zhivago'' was smuggled to [[Milan]] and published in 1957</span>
				<span class='text'>Pasternak was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1958, an event which both humiliated and enraged the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], which forced him to decline the prize, though his descendants were later to accept it in his name in 1988</span>

				<span class='text'>His mother was [[Rosa Kaufman]], a concert pianist and the daughter of [[Odessa]] industrialist Isadore Kaufman and his wife</span>
				<span class='text'>Pasternak had a younger brother Alex and sisters [[Lydia Pasternak Slater|Lydia]] and Josephine</span>
				<span class='text'>n a 1959 letter to [[Jacqueline de Proyart]], Pasternak recalled,{{quote|I was baptized as a child by my [[nanny]], but because of the restrictions imposed on Jews, particularly in the case of a family which was exempt from them and enjoyed a certain reputation in view of my father's standing as an artist, there was something a little complicated about this, and it was always felt to be half-secret and intimate, a source of rare and exceptional inspiration rather than being calmly taken for granted</span>
				<span class='text'>I believe that this is at the root of my distinctiveness</span>
				<span class='text'>Most intensely of all my mind was occupied by Christianity in the years 1910–12, when the main foundations of this distinctiveness – my way of seeing things, the world, life – were taking shape</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), p 137</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}Shortly after his birth, Pasternak's parents had joined the [[Tolstoyan]] Movement</span>
				<span class='text'>Novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] was a close family friend, as Pasternak recalled, &quot;my father illustrated his books, went to see him, revered him, and </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he whole house was imbued with his spirit</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pasternak (1959) p 25&lt;/ref&gt;In a 1956 essay, Pasternak recalled his father's feverish work creating illustrations for Tolstoy's novel ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Past28&quot;/&gt; The novel was serialized in the journal ''[[Niva (magazine)|Niva]]'' by the publisher [[Adolf Marks|Fyodor Marx]], based in St Petersburg</span>
				<span class='text'>The sketches were drawn from observations in such places as courtrooms, prisons and on trains, in a spirit of realism</span>
				<span class='text'>To ensure that the sketches met the journal deadline, train conductors were enlisted to personally collect the illustrations</span>
				<span class='text'>Pasternak wrote,{{quote|My childish imagination was struck by the sight of a train conductor in his formal railway uniform, standing waiting at the door of the kitchen as if he were standing on a railway platform at the door of a compartment that was just about to leave the station</span>
				<span class='text'>Joiner's glue was boiling on the stove</span>
				<span class='text'>The illustrations were hurriedly wiped dry, fixed, glued on pieces of cardboard, rolled up, tied up</span>
				<span class='text'>The parcels, once ready, were sealed with sealing wax and handed to the conductor</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Past28&quot;&gt;Pasternak (1959) pp 27–28</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}According to [[Max Hayward]], &quot;In November 1910, when Tolstoy fled from his home and died in the stationmaster's house at [[Astapovo]], Leonid Pasternak was informed by telegram and he went there immediately, taking his son Boris with him, and made a drawing of Tolstoy on his deathbed</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), p ''xvi''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Regular visitors to the Pasternak's home also included [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Lev Shestov]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pasternak aspired first to be a musician</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pasternak (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by Scriabin, Pasternak briefly was a student at the [[Moscow Conservatory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1910 he abruptly left for the [[Imperial Germany|German]] [[University of Marburg]], where he studied under [[Neo-Kantian]] philosophers [[Hermann Cohen]], [[Nicolai Hartmann]] and [[Paul Natorp]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|''Boris Pasternak in 1910,'' by his father Leonid Pasternak]]Pasternak fell in love with Ida Wissotzkaya, a girl from a notable Moscow family of tea merchants, whose company [[Wissotzky Tea]] was the largest tea company in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>Pasternak had tutored her in the final class of high school</span>
				<span class='text'>He helped her prepare for finals</span>
				<span class='text'>They met in Marburg during the summer of 1912 when Boris' father, [[Leonid Pasternak]], painted her portrait</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ivinskaya 1978 p 395&quot;&gt;Ivinskaya (1978) p 395</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Although Professor Cohen encouraged him to remain in Germany and to pursue a Philosophy doctorate, Pasternak decided against it</span>
				<span class='text'>He returned to Moscow upon the outbreak of World War I</span>
				<span class='text'>His first book of poems was published later that year</span>
				<span class='text'>In the aftermath, Pasternak proposed marriage to Ida</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the Wissotzky family was disturbed by Pasternak's poor prospects and persuaded Ida to refuse him</span>
				<span class='text'>She turned him down and he told of his love and rejection in the poem &quot;Marburg&quot; (1917)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ivinskaya 1978 p 395&quot;/&gt;&quot;I quivered</span>
				<span class='text'>I flared up, and then was extinguished</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;br /&gt; I shook</span>
				<span class='text'>I had made a proposal - but late,&lt;br /&gt; Too late</span>
				<span class='text'>I was scared, and she had refused me</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;br /&gt; I pity her tears, am more blessed than a saint</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Another failed love affair in 1917 inspired the poems in his first book, ''[[My Sister, Life]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>His early verse cleverly dissimulates his preoccupation with [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>Its fabric includes striking alliterations, wild rhythmic combinations, day-to-day vocabulary, and hidden allusions to his favourite poets such as [[Rilke]], [[Lermontov]], [[Pushkin]] and German-language Romantic poets</span>
				<span class='text'>uring World War I, Pasternak taught and worked at a chemical factory in [[Vsevolodovo-Vilve]] near [[Perm]], which undoubtedly provided him with material for ''Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Zhivago'' many years later</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike the rest of his family and many of his closest friends, Pasternak chose not to leave Russia after the [[October Revolution]] of 1917</span>
				<span class='text'>According to [[Max Hayward]],{{quote|Pasternak remained in Moscow throughout the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] (1918–1920), making no attempt to escape abroad or to the [[White Movement|White-occupied]] south, as a number of other Russian writers did at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>No doubt, like Yuri Zhivago, he was momentarily impressed by the &quot;splendid surgery&quot; of the Bolshevik seizure of power in October 1917, but – again to judge by the evidence of the novel, and despite a personal admiration for [[Vladimir Lenin]], whom he saw at the [[Ninth party Congress|9th Congress of Soviets]] in 1921 – he soon began to harbor profound doubts about the claims and credentials of the regime, not to mention its style of rule</span>
				<span class='text'>The terrible shortages of food and fuel, and the depredations of the [[Red Terror]], made life very precarious in those years, particularly for the &quot;[[bourgeois]]&quot; [[intelligentsia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter written to Pasternak from abroad in the twenties, [[Marina Tsvetayeva]] reminded him of how she had run into him in the street in 1919 as he was on the way to sell some valuable books from his library in order to buy bread</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued to write original work and to translate, but after about the middle of 1918 it became almost impossible to publish</span>
				<span class='text'>The only way to make one's work known was to declaim it in the several &quot;literary&quot; cafes which then sprang up, or – anticipating [[samizdat]] – to circulate it in manuscript</span>
				<span class='text'>It was in this way that ''My Sister, Life'' first became available to a wider audience</span>

				<span class='text'>It made Pasternak the model for younger poets, and decisively changed the poetry of [[Osip Mandelshtam]], [[Marina Tsvetayeva]] and others</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing ''My Sister, Life'', Pasternak produced some hermetic pieces of uneven quality, including his masterpiece, the lyric cycle ''Rupture'' (1921)</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Pro-Soviet writers and their [[White emigre]] equivalents applauded Pasternak's poetry as pure, unbridled inspiration</span>
				<span class='text'>n the late 1920s, he also participated in the much celebrated tripartite correspondence with [[Rilke]] and [[Tsvetayeva]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He attempted to make his poetry more comprehensible by reworking his earlier pieces and starting two lengthy poems on the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also turned to prose and wrote several autobiographical stories, notably &quot;The Childhood of Luvers&quot; and &quot;Safe Conduct&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1922 Pasternak married Evgeniya Lurye  (Евгения Лурье), a student at the Art Institute</span>
				<span class='text'>The following year they had a son, Evgenii</span>
				<span class='text'>vidence of Pasternak's support of still-revolutionary members of the leadership of the Communist Party as late as 1926 is indicated by his worshipful poem &quot;In Memory of Reissner&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>y 1927, Pasternak's close friends [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] and [[Nikolai Aseyev]] were advocating the complete subordination of the Arts to the needs of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Boris Pasternak: Family Correspondence, 1921–1960,'' p 78</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to his sister Josephine, Pasternak wrote of his intentions to, &quot;break off relations,&quot; with both of them</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he expressed that it would be deeply painful, Pasternak explained that it could not be prevented</span>
				<span class='text'>He explained,{{quote|They don't in any way measure up to their exalted calling</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, they've fallen short of it but – difficult as it is for me to understand – a modern [[sophist]] might say that these last years have actually demanded a reduction in conscience and feeling in the name of greater intelligibility</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet now the very spirit of the times demands great, courageous purity</span>
				<span class='text'>And these men are ruled by trivial routine</span>
				<span class='text'>Subjectively, they're sincere and conscientious</span>
				<span class='text'>But I find it increasingly difficult to take into account the personal aspect of their convictions</span>
				<span class='text'>I'm not out on my own – people treat me well</span>
				<span class='text'>But all that only holds good up to a point</span>
				<span class='text'>It seems to me that I've reached that point</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Pasternak Slater, ''Boris Pasternak: Family Correspondence 1921–1960'', p 80</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}By 1932, Pasternak had strikingly reshaped his style to make it more understandable to the general public and printed the new collection of poems, aptly titled ''The Second Birth''</span>
				<span class='text'>Although its Caucasian pieces were as brilliant as the earlier efforts, the book alienated the core of Pasternak's refined audience abroad, which was largely composed of anti-communist emigres</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1932 Pasternak fell in love with Zinaida Neigauz, the wife of the pianist [[Heinrich Neuhaus|Genrikh Neigauz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They both got divorces and married two years later</span>
				<span class='text'>e continued to change his poetry, simplifying his style and language through the years, as expressed in his next book, ''Early Trains'' (1943)</span>
				<span class='text'>==Stalin Epigram===After [[Joseph Stalin]] was acclaimed as leader of the [[CPSU]] in 1929, Pasternak became further disillusioned with the Party's tightening censorship of literature</span>
				<span class='text'>Still unwilling to conform, Pasternak remained a close friend of [[Anna Akhmatova]] and [[Osip Mandelstam]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Mandelstam recited his searing indictment of Stalin, the &quot;[[Stalin Epigram]],&quot; to Pasternak soon after its composition in late April 1934</span>
				<span class='text'>After listening, Pasternak told Mandelstam:{{quote|I didn't hear this, you didn't recite it to me, because, you know, very strange and terrible things are happening now: they've begun to pick people up</span>
				<span class='text'>I'm afraid the walls have ears and perhaps even these benches on the boulevard here may be able to listen and tell tales</span>
				<span class='text'>So let's make out that I heard nothing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ivin61&quot;&gt;Ivinskaya (1978) pp 61–63&lt;/ref&gt;}}On the night of 14 May 1934, Mandelstam was arrested at his home based on a warrant signed by [[NKVD]] boss [[Genrikh Yagoda]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Devastated, Pasternak went immediately to the offices of ''[[Izvestia]]'' and begged [[Nikolai Bukharin]] to intercede on Mandelstam's behalf</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to [[Olga Ivinskaya]], later Pasternak's lover, Pasternak was deeply upset by Mandelstam's arrest</span>
				<span class='text'>He was concerned for his friend but he also worried that he might be blamed for betraying Mandelstam to the secret police</span>
				<span class='text'>Ivinskaya writes that Pasternak &quot;raced frantically all over town, telling everybody that he was not to blame and denying responsibility for Mandelstam's disappearance, which for some reason he thought might be laid at his door</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ivin61&quot;/&gt;Soon after his meeting with Bukharin, the telephone rang in Pasternak's Moscow apartment</span>
				<span class='text'>A voice from [[Moscow Kremlin|The Kremlin]] said, &quot;Comrade [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] wishes to speak with you</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ivin61&quot;/&gt; According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak was struck dumb</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;He was totally unprepared for such a conversation</span>
				<span class='text'>But then he heard ''his'' voice, the voice of Stalin, coming over the line</span>
				<span class='text'>The Leader addressed him in a rather bluff uncouth fashion, using the familiar ''thou'' form: 'Tell me, what are they saying in your literary circles about the arrest of Mandelstam?'&quot; Flustered, Pasternak denied that there was any discussion or that there were any literary circles left in Soviet Russia</span>
				<span class='text'>Stalin went on to ask him for his own opinion of Mandelstam</span>
				<span class='text'>In an &quot;eager fumbling manner&quot; Pasternak explained that he and Mandelstam each had a completely different philosophy about poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>Ivinskaya writes that he:{{quote|…went on for quite a time in this vein</span>
				<span class='text'>Stalin gave him no encouragement whatsoever, not interjecting, or uttering a sound of any kind</span>
				<span class='text'>At last B[oris] L[eonidovich] came to a halt</span>
				<span class='text'>Stalin then said, in a mocking tone of voice: &quot;I see, you just aren't able to stick up for a comrade,&quot; and put down the receiver</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ivin61&quot;/&gt;}}Years later, Pasternak recalled that he was horrified at how the conversation had ended</span>
				<span class='text'>He repeatedly telephoned the Kremlin's number, begging to be reconnected to Stalin</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, Pasternak was told, &quot;Comrade Stalin is busy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Pasternak became frantic, pacing around his apartment repeating over and over that he must write to Stalin to explain what he had meant and to also say that injustices were being committed in the name of the Leader</span>
				<span class='text'>Pasternak later did write and send just such a letter</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ivin61&quot;/&gt;According to Ivinskaya:{{quote|If ever the conversation turned to Mandelstam, [Boris Leonidovich] would always hark back to the same thing: that he was not to blame for his misfortunes, and that if he had not written to Bukharin and in general made a great fuss about his arrest, then perhaps Mandelstam would not even have had the respite, brief as it was, which was granted to him – with the result that the ''Voronezh Notebooks'' might never have been written</span>
				<span class='text'>It was clear, however, that [Boris Leonidovich] himself felt he had not come as well as he should out of his unexpected conversation with the Leader</span>
				<span class='text'>He had done something not quite right</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), pp 156–157</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}===Great Purge==={{Main|Great Purge}}According to Pasternak, during the 1937 [[Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization|show trial]] of General [[Iona Yakir]] and Marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] requested all members to add their names to a statement supporting the death penalty for the defendants</span>
				<span class='text'>They demanded Pasternak's signature as well, but he refused to give it</span>
				<span class='text'>Vladimir Stavski, the chairman of the Union, was terrified that he would be punished for Pasternak's dissent</span>
				<span class='text'>The leadership of the Union travelled to Pasternak's dacha at [[Peredelkino]] and severely threatened the writer, who refused to sign the statement and returned to his [[dacha]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hearing this, Zinaida Pasternak, who was pregnant, was terribly upset, accusing him of risking the destruction of their family</span>
				<span class='text'>Pasternak went to bed</span>
				<span class='text'>He and Zinaida expected to be arrested that evening</span>
				<span class='text'>They later learned that an [[NKVD]] agent was hiding in the bushes outside their window and wrote down every word they said to each other</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ivinskaya 1978 pp 132-133&quot;&gt;Ivinskaya (1978) pp 132–133&lt;/ref&gt;Soon after, Pasternak appealed directly to Stalin</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote about his family's strong [[Tolstoyan]] convictions, which he still held dear</span>
				<span class='text'>He declared that his own life was at the Leader's disposal</span>
				<span class='text'>He said, that he could not stand as a self-appointed judge of life and death</span>
				<span class='text'>Pasternak was certain that he would be instantly arrested, but he was not</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ivinskaya 1978 pp 132-133&quot;/&gt; Stalin is said to have crossed Pasternak's name off an execution list during the [[Great Purge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Pasternak, Stalin declared, &quot;Do not touch this cloud dweller&quot; (or, in another version, &quot;Leave that holy fool alone!&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978) p 133</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Although Pasternak was never arrested by the [[Soviet secret police]], his close friend [[Titsian Tabidze]] fell victim to the Great Purge</span>
				<span class='text'>In an autobiographical essay published in the 1950s, Pasternak described the execution of Tabidze and the [[suicides]] of [[Marina Tsvetaeva]] and [[Paolo Iashvili]] as the greatest heartbreaks of his entire life</span>
				<span class='text'>vinskaya wrote, &quot;I believe that between Stalin and Pasternak there was an incredible, silent [[duel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), p 135</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===World War II===Pasternak was elated by the outbreak of war between [[Nazi Germany]] and the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>When the [[Luftwaffe]] began bombing Moscow, Pasternak immediately began to serve as a fire warden on the roof of the writer's building on Lavrushinski Street</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1943, Pasternak was finally granted permission to visit the soldiers at the front</span>
				<span class='text'>He bore up well, considering the hardships of the journey (he had a weak leg from an old injury), and he wanted to go to the most dangerous places</span>
				<span class='text'>He read his poetry and talked extensively with the active and injured troops</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ivin72&quot;/&gt;With the end of the war in 1945, the Soviet people expected to see the end of the devastation of [[Nazism]], and hoped for the end of Stalin's Purges</span>
				<span class='text'>But, sealed trains began carrying large numbers of prisoners to the Soviet [[Gulag]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Some were [[Nazi collaborator]]s who had fought under General [[Andrey Vlasov]], but most were ordinary Soviet officers and men</span>
				<span class='text'>Pasternak watched as ex-POWs were directly transferred from Nazi Germany to Soviet [[concentration camp]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>[[White emigre]]s who had returned due to pledges of [[amnesty]] were also sent directly to the Gulag, as were Jews from the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee|Anti-Fascist Committee]] and other organizations</span>
				<span class='text'>Many thousands of innocent people were incarcerated in connection with the [[Leningrad Affair]] and the so-called [[Doctor's Plot]], while whole ethnic groups were [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported to Siberia]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Pasternak later said, &quot;If, in a bad dream, we had seen all the horrors in store for us after the war, we should not have been sorry to see Stalin fall, together with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, an end to the war in favour of our [[Western Allies|allies]], civilized countries with democratic traditions, would have meant a hundred times less suffering for our people than that which Stalin again inflicted on it after his victory</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|[[Olga Ivinskaya]] (1912–1995)]]In October 1946, the married Pasternak met [[Olga Ivinskaya]], a single mother employed by ''[[Novy Mir]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Deeply moved by her resemblance to his first love Ida Vysotskaya,&lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978) pp 12, 395, footnote 3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Pasternak gave Ivinskaya several volumes of his poetry and literary translations</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Pasternak never left his wife Zinaida, he started an extramarital relationship with Ivinskaya that would last for the remainder of Pasternak's life</span>
				<span class='text'>Ivinskaya later recalled, &quot;He phoned almost every day and, instinctively fearing to meet or talk with him, yet dying of happiness, I would stammer out that I was &quot;busy today</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; But almost every afternoon, toward the end of working hours, he came in person to the office and often walked with me through the streets, boulevards, and squares all the way home to Potapov Street</span>
				<span class='text'>'Shall I make you a present of this square?' he would ask</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;She gave him the phone number of her neighbour Olga Volkova who resided below</span>
				<span class='text'>In the evenings, Pasternak would phone and Volkova would signal by Olga banging on the water pipe which connected their apartments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978) p 12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;When they first met, Pasternak was translating the verse of the Hungarian [[List of national poets|national poet]], [[Sándor Petőfi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pasternak gave his lover a book of Petőfi with the inscription, &quot;Petőfi served as a code in May and June 1947, and my close translations of his lyrics are an expression, adapted to the requirements of the text, of my feelings and thoughts for you and about you</span>
				<span class='text'>In memory of it all, B</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> 13 May 1948</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Pasternak later noted on a photograph of himself, &quot;Petőfi is magnificent with his descriptive lyrics and picture of nature, but you are better still</span>
				<span class='text'>I worked on him a good deal in 1947 and 1948, when I first came to know you</span>
				<span class='text'>Thank you for your help</span>
				<span class='text'>I was translating both of you</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978) p 27</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Ivinskaya would later describe the Petőfi translations as, &quot;a first declaration of love</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), p 28</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;According to Ivinskaya, Zinaida Pasternak was infuriated by her husband's infidelity</span>
				<span class='text'>Once, when his younger son Leonid fell seriously ill, Zinaida extracted a promise from her husband, as they stood by the boy's sickbed, that he would end his affair with Ivinskaya</span>
				<span class='text'>Pasternak asked Luisa Popova, a mutual friend, to tell Ivinskaya about his promise</span>
				<span class='text'>Popova told him that he must do it himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after, Ivinskaya happened to be ill at Popova's apartment, when suddenly Zinaida Pasternak arrived and confronted her</span>
				<span class='text'>vinskaya later recalled,{{quote|But I became so ill through loss of blood that she and Luisa had to get me to the hospital, and I no longer remember exactly what passed between me and this heavily built, strong-minded woman, who kept repeating how she didn't give a damn for our love and that, although she no longer loved [Boris Leonidovich] herself, she would not allow her family to be broken up</span>
				<span class='text'>After my return from the hospital, Boris came to visit me, as though nothing had happened, and touchingly made his peace with my mother, telling her how much he loved me</span>
				<span class='text'>By now she was pretty well used to these funny ways of his</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), p 23</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}In 1948, Pasternak advised Ivinskaya to resign her job at ''Novy Mir'', which was becoming extremely difficult due to their relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>In the aftermath, Pasternak began to instruct her in translating poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>In time, they began to refer to her apartment on Potapov Street as, &quot;Our Shop</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;On the evening of 6 October 1949, Ivinskaya was arrested at her apartment by the [[KGB]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Ivinskaya relates in her memoirs that, when the agents burst into her apartment, she was at her typewriter working on translations of the [[Korean poetry|Korean poet]] [[Won Tu-Son]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Her apartment was ransacked and all items connected with Pasternak were piled up in her presence</span>
				<span class='text'>Ivinskaya was taken to the [[Lubyanka (KGB)|Lubyanka Prison]] and repeatedly interrogated, where she refused to say anything incriminating about Pasternak</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time, she was pregnant with Pasternak's child and had a miscarriage early in her ten-year sentence in the [[GULAG]]</span>
				<span class='text'>pon learning of his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]' arrest, Pasternak telephoned Liuisa Popova and asked her to come at once to [[Gogol Boulevard]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She found him sitting on a bench near the [[Kropotkinskaya|Palace of Soviets Metro Station]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Weeping, Pasternak told her, &quot;Everything is finished now</span>
				<span class='text'>They've taken her away from me and I'll never see her again</span>
				<span class='text'>It's like death, even worse</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ivinskaya 1978, p 86&quot;&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), p 86</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;According to Ivinskaya, &quot;After this, in conversation with people he scarcely knew, he always referred to Stalin as a 'murderer</span>
				<span class='text'> Talking with people in the offices of literary periodicals, he often asked: 'When will there be an end to this freedom for lackeys who happily walk over corpses to further their own interests?' He spent a good deal of time with Akhmatova—who in those years was given a very wide berth by most of the people who knew her</span>
				<span class='text'>He worked intensively on the second part of ''Doctor Zhivago''</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ivinskaya 1978, p 86&quot;/&gt;In a 1958 letter to a friend in [[West Germany]], Pasternak wrote, &quot;She was put in jail on my account, as the person considered by the [[KGB|secret police]] to be closest to me, and they hoped that by means of a gruelling interrogation and threats they could extract enough evidence from her to put me on trial</span>
				<span class='text'>I owe my life, and the fact that they did not touch me in those years, to her heroism and endurance</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978) p 109</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Translating Goethe===Pasternak's translation of the [[Faust: The First Part of the Tragedy|first part]] of ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' led him to be attacked in the August 1950 edition of ''[[Novy Mir]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The critic accused Pasternak of distorting [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s &quot;progressive&quot; meanings to support &quot;the reactionary theory of 'pure art'&quot;, as well as introducing aesthetic and [[individualist]] values</span>
				<span class='text'>In a subsequent letter to the daughter of Marina Tsvetaeva, Pasternak explained that the attack was motivated by the fact that the supernatural elements of the play, which ''Novy Mir'' considered, &quot;irrational,&quot; had been translated as Goethe had written them</span>
				<span class='text'>Pasternak further declared that, despite the attacks on his translation, his contract for the [[Faust: The Second Part of the Tragedy|second part]] had not been revoked</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ivin78&quot;/&gt;===Khrushchev thaw===When Stalin died of a stroke on 5 March 1953, Olga Ivinskaya was still imprisoned in the [[Gulag]], and Pasternak was in Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>Across the nation, there were waves of panic, confusion, and public displays of grief</span>
				<span class='text'>Pasternak wrote, &quot;Men who are not free</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>always idealize their bondage</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978) p 144</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;After her release, Pasternak's relationship with Ivinskaya picked up where it had left off</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after he confided in her, &quot;For so long we were ruled over by a madman and a murderer, and now by a fool and a pig</span>
				<span class='text'>The madman had his occasional flights of fancy, he had an intuitive feeling for certain things, despite his wild obscurantism</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Pasternak delighted in reading a clandestine copy of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' in English</span>
				<span class='text'>In conversation with Ivinskaya, Pasternak explained that the pig dictator [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], in the novel, &quot;vividly reminded&quot; him of Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Censors also regarded some passages as [[anti-Soviet]], especially the novel's criticisms{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} of [[Stalinism]], [[Collectivisation]], the [[Great Purge]], and the [[Gulag]]</span>
				<span class='text'>asternak's fortunes were soon to change, however</span>
				<span class='text'> In March 1956, the [[Italian Communist Party]] sent a journalist, [[Sergio d'Angelo]], to work in the Soviet Union, and his status as a journalist as well as his membership in the Italian Communist Party allowed him to have access to various aspects of the cultural life in Moscow at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>A Milan publisher, the communist [[Giangiacomo Feltrinelli]], had also given him a commission to find new works of Soviet literature that would be appealing to Western audiences, and upon learning of ''Doctor Zhivago'''s existence, d'Angelo travelled immediately to Peredelkino and offered to submit Pasternak's novel to Feltrinelli's company for publication</span>
				<span class='text'>At first Pasternak was stunned</span>
				<span class='text'>Then he brought the manuscript from his study and told d'Angelo with a laugh, &quot;You are hereby invited to watch me face the firing squad</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lazar Fleishman, ''Boris Pasternak: The Poet and His Politics'', p 275</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;According to Lazar Fleishman, Pasternak was aware that he was taking a huge risk</span>
				<span class='text'>No Soviet author had attempted to deal with Western publishers since the 1920s, when such behavior led the Soviet State to declare war on [[Boris Pilnyak]] and [[Evgeny Zamyatin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pasternak, however, believed that Feltrinelli's Communist affiliation would not only guarantee publication, but might even force the Soviet State to publish the novel in Russia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Fleishman, pp 275–276</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In a rare moment of agreement, both Olga Ivinskaya and Zinaida Pasternak were horrified by the submission of ''Doctor Zhivago'' to a Western publishing house</span>
				<span class='text'>Pasternak, however, refused to change his mind and informed an emissary from Feltrinelli that he was prepared to undergo any sacrifice in order to see ''Doctor Zhivago'' published</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Fleishman, p 276</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1957, Feltrinelli announced that the novel would be published by his company</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite repeated demands from visiting Soviet emissaries, Feltrinelli refused to cancel or delay publication</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Ivinskaya, &quot;He did not believe that we would ever publish the manuscript here and felt he had no right to withhold a masterpiece from the world – this would be an even greater crime</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), p 203</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet government forced Pasternak to cable the publisher to withdraw the manuscript, but he sent separate, secret letters advising Feltrinelli to ignore the telegrams</span>
				<span class='text'>{r|washingtonpost}}Helped considerably by the Soviet campaign against the novel (as well as by the U</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s secret purchase of hundreds of copies of the book as it came off the presses around the world – see &quot;Nobel Prize&quot; section below), ''Doctor Zhivago'' became an instant sensation throughout the non-Communist world upon its release in November 1957</span>
				<span class='text'>In the [[State of Israel]], however, Pasternak's novel was sharply criticized for its [[assimilationist]] views towards the [[Jewish people]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When informed of this, Pasternak responded, &quot;No matter</span>
				<span class='text'>I am above race</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), p 136</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to Lazar Fleishman, Pasternak had written the disputed passages prior to Israeli independence</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time, Pasternak had also been regularly attending Russian Orthodox [[Divine Liturgy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, he believed that Soviet Jews converting to Christianity was preferable to assimilating into [[atheism]] and [[Stalinism]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The first English translation of ''Doctor Zhivago'' was hastily produced by [[Max Hayward]] and [[Manya Harari]] in order to coincide with overwhelming public demand</span>

				<span class='text'>Between 1958 and 1959, the English language edition spent 26 weeks at the top of ''[[The New York Times]]''' bestseller list</span>
				<span class='text'>vinskaya's daughter Irina circulated typed copies of the novel in [[Samizdat]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although no Soviet critics had read the banned novel, ''Doctor Zhivago'' was pilloried in the State-owned press</span>
				<span class='text'>Similar attacks led to a humorous Russian saying, &quot;I haven't read Pasternak, but I condemn him&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), pp 268–271</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;During the aftermath of the Second World War, Pasternak had composed a series of poems on [[Gospel]] themes</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak had regarded Stalin as a, &quot;giant of the pre-Christian era</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Therefore, Pasternak's Christian-themed poems were, &quot;a form of protest</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), p 134</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On 9 September 1958, the ''Literary Gazette'' critic Viktor Pertsov retaliated by denouncing, &quot;the decadent religious poetry of Pasternak, which reeks of mothballs from the [[Russian Symbolism|Symbolist]] suitcase of 1908–10 manufacture</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), p 231</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the author received much [[hate mail]] from Communists both at home and abroad</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak continued to receive such letters for the remainder of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), p 230</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In a letter written to his sister Josephine, however, Pasternak recalled the words of his friend Ekaterina Krashennikova upon reading ''Doctor Zhivago''</span>
				<span class='text'>She had said, &quot;Don't forget yourself to the point of believing that it was you who wrote this work</span>

				<span class='text'>By the end of the Fair, 355 copies of Doctor Zhivago had been surreptitiously handed out, and eventually thousands more were distributed throughout the Communist bloc</span>

				<span class='text'> Subsequently, the CIA funded the publication of a miniature, lightweight paperback edition of Doctor Zhivago that could be easily mailed or concealed in a jacket pocket</span>

				<span class='text'>Pasternak wrote that he was wracked with torments and anxieties at the thought of placing his loved ones in danger</span>
				<span class='text'>n 23 October 1958, Boris Pasternak was announced as the winner of the Nobel Prize</span>
				<span class='text'>The citation credited Pasternak's contribution to Russian lyric poetry and for his role in, &quot;continuing the great Russian epic tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; On 25 October, Pasternak sent a [[telegram]] to the [[Swedish Academy]]: &quot;Infinitely grateful, touched, proud, surprised, overwhelmed</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), p 221</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; That same day, the Literary Institute in Moscow demanded that all its students sign a petition denouncing Pasternak and his novel</span>
				<span class='text'>They were further ordered to join a &quot;spontaneous&quot; demonstration demanding Pasternak's exile from the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), pp 223–224</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; On 26 October, the ''Literary Gazette'' ran an article by David Zaslavski entitled, ''[[Reactionary]] Propaganda Uproar over a Literary Weed''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), p 224</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;According to [[Solomon Volkov]]:{{quote|The anti-Pasternak campaign was organized in the worst Stalin tradition: denunciations in ''Pravda'' and other newspapers; publications of angry letters from, &quot;ordinary Soviet workers,&quot; who had not read the book; hastily convened meetings of Pasternak's friends and colleagues, at which fine poets like [[Vladimir Soloukin]], [[Leonid Martynov]], and [[Boris Slutsky]] were forced to censure an author they respected</span>
				<span class='text'>Slutsky, who in his brutal prose-like poems had created an image for himself as a courageous soldier and truth-lover, was so tormented by his anti-Pasternak speech that he later went insane</span>
				<span class='text'>On October 29, 1958, at the plenum of the Central Committee of the Young Communist League, dedicated to the [[Komsomol]]'s fortieth anniversary, its head, [[Vladimir Semichastny]], attacked Pasternak before an audience of 14,000 people, including Khrushchev and other Party leaders</span>
				<span class='text'>Semishastny first called Pasternak, &quot;a mangy sheep,&quot; who pleased the enemies of the Soviet Union with, &quot;his slanderous so-called work</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Then Semichastny (who became head of the KGB in 1961) added that, &quot;this man went and spat in the face of the people</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; And he concluded with, &quot;If you compare Pasternak to a pig, a pig would not do what he did,&quot; because a pig, &quot;never shits where it eats</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Khrushchev applauded demonstratively</span>
				<span class='text'>News of that speech drove Pasternak to the brink of suicide</span>
				<span class='text'>It has recently come to light that the real author of Semichastny's insults was Khrushchev, who had called the Komsomol leader the night before and dictated his lines about the mangy sheep and the pig, which Semichastny described as a, &quot;typically Khrushchevian, deliberately crude, unceremoniously scolding</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}Furthermore, Pasternak was informed that, if he traveled to [[Stockholm]] to collect his Nobel Medal, he would be refused re-entry to the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, Pasternak sent a second telegram to the Nobel Committee: &quot;In view of the meaning given the award by the society in which I live, I must renounce this undeserved distinction which has been conferred on me</span>
				<span class='text'>Please do not take my voluntary renunciation amiss</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), p 232</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish Academy announced: &quot;This refusal, of course, in no way alters the validity of the award</span>

				<span class='text'>Whatever my mistakes or failings, I could not imagine that I should find myself at the center of such a political campaign as has been worked up round my name in the West</span>
				<span class='text'>Once I was aware of this, I informed the Swedish Academy of my voluntary renunciation of the Nobel Prize</span>
				<span class='text'>Departure beyond the borders of my country would for me be tantamount to death and I therefore request you not to take this extreme measure with me</span>
				<span class='text'>With my hand on my heart, I can say that I have done something for Soviet literature, and may still be of use to it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), pp 240–241</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}In ''The Oak and the Calf'', [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]] sharply criticized Pasternak, both for declining the Nobel Prize and for sending such a letter to Khrushchev</span>
				<span class='text'>In her own memoirs, Olga Ivinskaya blames herself for pressuring her lover into making both decisions</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Yevgenii Pasternak, &quot;She accused herself bitterly for persuading Pasternak to decline the Prize</span>
				<span class='text'>After all that had happened, open shadowing, friends turning away, Pasternak's suicidal condition at the time, one can</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>u&quot;/&gt;On 31 October 1958, the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] held a trial behind closed doors</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the meeting minutes, Pasternak was denounced as an internal [[White emigre]] and a Fascist [[fifth columnist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Afterwards, the attendees announced that Pasternak had been expelled from the Union</span>
				<span class='text'>They further signed a petition to the [[Politburo]], demanding that Pasternak be stripped of his Soviet citizenship and exiled to, &quot;his Capitalist paradise</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), pp 251–261</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to Yevgenii Pasternak, however, author [[Konstantin Paustovsky]] refused to attend the meeting</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]] did attend, but walked out in disgust</span>

				<span class='text'>u&quot;/&gt;According to Yevgenii Pasternak, his father would have been exiled had it not been for Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], who telephoned Khrushchev and threatened to find a Committee for Pasternak's protection</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;english</span>
				<span class='text'>ravda</span>
				<span class='text'>u&quot;/&gt;It is possible that the 1958 Nobel Prize prevented Pasternak's imprisonment due to the Soviet State's fear of international protests</span>
				<span class='text'>Yevgenii Pasternak believes, however, that the resulting persecution fatally weakened his father's health</span>

				<span class='text'>He also continued translating the writings of [[Juliusz Słowacki]] and [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In his work on Calderon, Pasternak received the discreet support of Nikolai Mikhailovich Liubimov, a senior figure in the Party's literary apparatus</span>

				<span class='text'>Concentrating on the [[love triangle]] aspects of the novel, the film became a worldwide blockbuster, but was unavailable in Russia until [[Perestroika]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 2002, the novel was adapted as a [[Doctor Zhivago (TV serial)|television miniseries]]</span>

				<span class='text'>=Work=====Poetry=======Thoughts on poetry====According to Ivinskaya:{{quote|In Pasternak the 'all-powerful god of detail' always, it seems, revolted against the idea of turning out verse for its own sake or to convey vague personal moods</span>
				<span class='text'>If 'eternal' themes were to be dealt with yet again, then only by a poet in the true sense of the word – otherwise he should not have the strength of character to touch them at all</span>
				<span class='text'>Poetry so tightly packed (till it crunched like ice) or distilled into a solution where 'grains of true prose germinated,' a poetry in which realistic detail cast a genuine spell – only such poetry was acceptable to Pasternak; but not poetry for which indulgence was required, or for which allowances had to be made – that is, the kind of ephemeral poetry which is particularly common in an age of literary conformism</span>
				<span class='text'>[Boris Leonidovich] could weep over the 'purple-gray circle' which glowed above [[Alexander Blok|Blok]]'s tormented muse and he never failed to be moved by the terseness of [[Pushkin]]'s sprightly lines, but rhymed slogans about the production of tin cans in the so-called 'poetry' of [[Surkov]] and his like, as well as the outpourings about love in the work of those young poets who only echo each other and the classics – all this left him cold at best and for the most part made him indignant</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ivinskaya 1978, p 145&quot;&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), p 145</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}For this reason, Pasternak regularly avoided literary cafes where young poets regularly invited them to read their verse</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Ivinskaya, &quot;It was this sort of thing that moved him to say: 'Who started the idea that I love poetry? I can't stand poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ivinskaya 1978, p 145&quot;/&gt;Also according to Ivinskaya, &quot;'The way they could write!' he once exclaimed – by 'they' he meant the Russian classics</span>
				<span class='text'>And immediately afterward, reading or, rather, glancing through some verse in the ''Literary Gazette'': 'Just look how tremendously well they've learned to rhyme! But there's actually nothing there – it would be better to say it in a news bulletin</span>
				<span class='text'>What has poetry got to do with this?' By 'they' in this case, he meant the poets writing today</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), p 146</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Translation====Reluctant to conform to [[Socialist Realism]], Pasternak turned to translation in order to provide for his family</span>
				<span class='text'>He soon produced acclaimed translations of [[Sándor Petőfi]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], and [[Nikoloz Baratashvili]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Osip Mandelstam]], however, privately warned him, &quot;Your collected works will consist of twelve volumes of translations, and only one of your own work</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ivin78&quot;&gt;Ivinskaya (1978) pp 78–79</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In a 1942 letter, Pasternak declared, &quot;I am completely opposed to contemporary ideas about translation</span>
				<span class='text'>The work of Lozinski, Radlova, [[Samuil Marshak|Marshak]], and [[Kornei Chukovsky|Chukovski]] is alien to me, and seems artificial, soulless, and lacking in depth</span>
				<span class='text'>I share the nineteenth century view of translation as a literary exercise demanding insight of a higher kind than that provided by a merely philological approach</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ivin78&quot;/&gt;According to Ivinskaya, Pasternak believed in not being too literal in his translations, which he felt could confuse the meaning of the text</span>
				<span class='text'>He instead advocated observing each poem from afar to plumb its true depths</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ivin28&quot;&gt;Ivinskaya (1978) pp 28–29</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Pasternak's translations of [[William Shakespeare]] (''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''King Henry IV'' (Parts I and II), ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Boris Pasternak, ''I Remember: Sketch for an Autobiography'', Pantheon Books, 1959</span>
				<span class='text'>p 127</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; remain deeply popular with Russian audiences because of their colloquial, modernised dialogues</span>
				<span class='text'>Pasternak's critics, however, accused him of &quot;pasternakizing&quot; Shakespeare</span>
				<span class='text'>In a 1956 essay, Pasternak wrote, &quot;Translating Shakespeare is a task which takes time and effort</span>
				<span class='text'>Once it is undertaken, it is best to divide it into sections long enough for the work to not get stale and to complete one section each day</span>
				<span class='text'>In thus daily progressing through the text, the translator finds himself reliving the circumstances of the author</span>
				<span class='text'>Day by day, he reproduces his actions and he is drawn into some of his secrets, not in theory, but practically, by experience</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pasternak, (1959) p 142</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;According to Ivinskaya:{{quote|Whenever [Boris Leonidovich] was provided with literal versions of things which echoed his own thoughts or feelings, it made all the difference and he worked feverishly, turning them into masterpieces</span>
				<span class='text'>I remember his translating [[Paul Verlaine]] in a burst of enthusiasm like this – ''[[:s:fr:Art poétique (Verlaine)|Art poétique (Verlaine)]]'' was after all an expression of his own beliefs about poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), p 34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}While they were both collaborating on translating [[Rabindranath Tagore]] from [[Bengali language|Bengali]] into Russian, Pasternak advised Ivinskaya, &quot;1) Bring out the theme of the poem, its subject matter, as clearly as possible; 2) tighten up the fluid, non-European form by rhyming internally, not at the end of the lines; 3) use loose, irregular [[Meter (poetry)|meters]], mostly ternary ones</span>
				<span class='text'>You may allow yourself to use [[assonance]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ivin28&quot;/&gt;Later, while she was collaborating with him on a translation of [[Vítězslav Nezval]], Pasternak told Ivinskaya:{{quote|Use the literal translation only for the ''meaning'', but do not borrow words as they stand from it: they are absurd and not always comprehensible</span>
				<span class='text'>Don't translate everything, only what you can manage, and by this means try to make the translation more precise than the original – an absolute necessity in the case of such a confused, slipshod piece of work</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ivin28&quot;/&gt;}}According to [[Olga Ivinskaya]], however, translation was not a genuine vocation for Pasternak</span>
				<span class='text'>She later recalled:{{quote|One day someone brought him a copy of a British newspaper in which there was a double feature under the title, &quot;Pasternak Keeps a Courageous Silence</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; It said that if Shakespeare had written in Russian he would have written in the same way he was translated by Pasternak</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>What a pity, the article continued, that Pasternak published nothing but translations, writing his own work for himself and a small circle of intimate friends</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;What do they mean by saying that my silence is courageous?&quot; [Boris Leonidovich] commented sadly after reading all this</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I am silent because I am not printed</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ivinskaya (1978), p 35</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}===Music===Boris Pasternak was also a composer, and had a promising musical career as a musician ahead of him, had he chosen to pursue it</span>
				<span class='text'>He came from a musical family: his mother was a concert pianist and a student of [[Anton Rubinstein]] and [[Theodor Leschetizky]], and Pasternak's early impressions were of hearing piano trios in the home</span>
				<span class='text'>The family had a [[dacha]] – country house – close to one occupied by [[Alexander Scriabin]]; [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] were all visitors to the family home</span>
				<span class='text'>His father Leonid was a painter who produced one of the most important portraits of Scriabin, and Pasternak wrote many years later of witnessing with great excitement the creation of Scriabin's [[Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>3 (Scriabin)|Symphony No</span>
				<span class='text'>3, &quot;The Divine Poem&quot;]], in 1903</span>
				<span class='text'>asternak began to compose at the age of 13</span>
				<span class='text'>The high achievements of his mother discouraged him from becoming a pianist, but – inspired by Scriabin – he entered the [[Moscow Conservatory]], but left abruptly in 1910 at the age of twenty, to study philosophy in [[Marburg University]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Four years later he returned to Moscow, having finally decided on a career in literature, publishing his first book of poems, influenced by [[Alexander Blok]] and the [[Russian Futurists]], the same year</span>
				<span class='text'>asternak's early compositions show the clear influence of Scriabin</span>
				<span class='text'>His single-movement Piano Sonata of 1909 shows a more mature and individual voice</span>
				<span class='text'>Nominally in B minor, it moves freely from key to key with frequent changes of key-signature and a chromatic dissonant style that defies easy analysis</span>
				<span class='text'>Although composed during his time at the Conservatory, the Sonata was composed at Raiki, some 27 miles north-east of Moscow, where Leonid Pasternak had his painting studio and taught his students</span>
				<span class='text'>(NB</span>
				<span class='text'>This is not the site of the Pasternak family dacha, now open to the public, in the writers' colony at [[Peredelkino]], which is about 16 miles south-west of the capital</span>
