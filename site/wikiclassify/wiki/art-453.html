				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sites from these works which still exist in Waukegan include his boyhood home, his grandparents' home next door (and their connecting lawns where he and his grandfather gathered dandelions to make wine) and, less than a block away, the famous ravine which Bradbury used as a [[metaphor]] throughout his career</span>

				<span class='text'>He took a Greyhound bus to New York and checked into a room at the YMCA for fifty cents a night</span>
				<span class='text'>He took his short stories to a dozen publishers and no one wanted them</span>
				<span class='text'>Just before getting ready to go home, Bradbury had dinner with an editor at Doubleday</span>
				<span class='text'>When Bradbury recounted that everyone wanted a novel and he didn't have one, the editor, coincidentally named Walter Bradbury, asked if the short stories might be tied together into a book length collection</span>
				<span class='text'>The title was the editor's idea; he suggested, &quot;You could call it &quot;The Martian Chronicles</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Bradbury liked the idea and recalled making notes in 1944 to do a book set on Mars</span>
				<span class='text'>That evening, he stayed up all night at the YMCA and typed out an outline</span>
				<span class='text'>He took it to the Doubleday editor the next morning, who read it and wrote Bradbury a check for seven hundred and fifty dollars</span>

				<span class='text'>'&lt;ref name=&quot;Paris Review&quot;/&gt;===Intended first novel===What was later issued as a collection of stories and vignettes, ''Summer Morning, Summer Night'', started out to be Bradbury's first true novel</span>
				<span class='text'>The core of the work was Bradbury's witnessing of the American small-town and life in the American heartland</span>
				<span class='text'>n the winter of 1955â€“56, after a consultation with his Doubleday editor, Bradbury deferred publication of a novel based on Green Town, the pseudonym for his hometown</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, he extracted seventeen stories and, with three other Green Town tales, bridged them into his 1957 book ''Dandelion Wine''</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, in 2006, Bradbury published the original novel remaining after the extraction, and retitled it ''Farewell Summer''</span>
				<span class='text'>These two titles show what stories and episodes Bradbury decided to retain as he created the two books out of one</span>
				<span class='text'>he most significant of the remaining  unpublished stories, scenes, and fragments were published under the originally intended name for the novel, ''Summer Morning, Summer Night'', in 2007</span>
