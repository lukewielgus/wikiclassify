				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She is also noted for the invention of a [[constructed language]] known as ''[[Lingua Ignota]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the history of her formal consideration is complicated, she has been recognized as a saint by branches of the Roman Catholic Church for centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>On 7 October 2012, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] named her a [[Doctor of the Church]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!-- no need for citations here, save that for the detail section below --&gt;==Biography==Hildegard's exact date of birth is uncertain</span>
				<span class='text'>She was born around the year 1098 to Mechtild of Merxheim-Nahet and Hildebert of Bermersheim, a family of the free lower nobility in the service of the Count Meginhard of [[County of Sponheim|Sponheim]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Some sources note younger siblings, specifically Bruno</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In her ''Vita'', Hildegard states that from a very young age she had experienced [[vision (religion)|visions]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Monastic life===Perhaps due to Hildegard's visions, or as a method of political positioning, Hildegard's parents offered her as an [[oblate]] to the [[Order of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Benedict|Benedictine]] monastery at the [[Disibodenberg]], which had been recently reformed in the [[Palatinate Forest]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The date of Hildegard's enclosure at the monastery is the subject of debate</span>
				<span class='text'>Her ''[[Hagiography|Vita]]'' says she was professed with an older woman, [[Jutta von Sponheim|Jutta]], the daughter of Count Stephan II of Sponheim, at the age of eight</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Jutta &amp; Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans</span>
				<span class='text'>Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), p</span>
				<span class='text'>139</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, Jutta's date of enclosure is known to have been in 1112, when Hildegard would have been fourteen</span>

				<span class='text'>30-51, at pp</span>
				<span class='text'>32-33</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars speculate that Hildegard was placed in the care of Jutta at the age of eight, and the two women were then enclosed together six years later</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Michael McGrade, &quot;Hildegard von Bingen&quot;, in ''Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart: allgemeine Enzyklopaldie der Musik,'' 2nd edition, T</span>
				<span class='text'>, Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>8, ed</span>
				<span class='text'>Ludwig Fischer (Kassel and New York: Bahrenreiter, 1994)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In any case, Hildegard and Jutta were enclosed together at the Disibodenberg, and formed the core of a growing community of women attached to the male monastery</span>
				<span class='text'>Jutta was also a visionary and thus attracted many followers who came to visit her at the cloister</span>
				<span class='text'>Hildegard tells us that Jutta taught her to read and write, but that she was unlearned and therefore incapable of teaching Hildegard sound biblical interpretation</span>

				<span class='text'>''Visionary Women'' (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), p</span>
				<span class='text'>6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The written record of the ''Life of Jutta'' indicates that Hildegard probably assisted her in reciting the psalms, working in the garden and other handiwork, and tending to the sick</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This might have been a time when Hildegard learned how to play the ten-stringed [[psaltery]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Volmar (monk)|Volmar]], a frequent visitor, may have taught Hildegard simple psalm notation</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Abbot Kuno of Disibodenberg asked Hildegard to be [[Prioress]], which would be under his authority</span>
				<span class='text'>Hildegard, however, wanted more independence for herself and her nuns, and asked Abbot Kuno to allow them to move to [[Rupertsberg]]</span>

				<span class='text'>''Visions and Longings: Medieval Women Mystics'' (Massachusetts: Shambhala Publications, 1996), p</span>
				<span class='text'>85</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This was to be a move towards poverty, from a stone complex that was well established to a temporary dwelling place</span>
				<span class='text'>When the abbot declined Hildegard's proposition, Hildegard went over his head and received the approval of [[Archbishop Henry I of Mainz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Abbot Kuno did not relent until Hildegard was stricken by an illness that kept her paralyzed and unable to move from her bed, an event that she attributed to God's unhappiness at her not following his orders to move her nuns to Rupertsberg</span>
				<span class='text'>It was only when the Abbot himself could not move Hildegard that he decided to grant the nuns their own monastery</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McGrade, &quot;Hildegard&quot;, ''MGG</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;/ref&gt; Hildegard and about twenty nuns thus moved to the St</span>
				<span class='text'>Rupertsberg monastery in 1150, where [[Volmar (monk)|Volmar]] served as provost, as well as Hildegard's confessor and scribe</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1165 Hildegard founded a second monastery for her nuns at [[Eibingen Abbey|Eibingen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Visions===Hildegard says that she first saw &quot;The Shade of the Living Light&quot; at the age of three, and by the age of five she began to understand that she was experiencing visions</span>

				<span class='text'>''Mystics of the Church'' (Pennsylvania: Morehouse Publishing, 1925), p</span>
				<span class='text'>77</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She used the term 'visio' to this feature of her experience, and recognized that it was a gift that she could not explain to others</span>
				<span class='text'>Hildegard explained that she saw all things in the light of God through the five senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch</span>

				<span class='text'>10</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hildegard was hesitant to share her visions, confiding only to [[Jutta von Sponheim|Jutta]], who in turn told Volmar, Hildegard's tutor and, later, secretary</span>

				<span class='text'>55</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Throughout her life, she continued to have many visions, and in 1141, at the age of 42, Hildegard received a vision she believed to be an instruction from God, to &quot;write down that which you see and hear</span>

				<span class='text'>''Visionary Women'' (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), p</span>
				<span class='text'>8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Still hesitant to record her visions, Hildegard became physically ill</span>
				<span class='text'>The illustrations recorded in the book of Scivias were visions that Hildegard experienced, causing her great suffering and tribulations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Underhill, Evelyn</span>
				<span class='text'>''Mystics of the Church'' (Pennsylvania: Morehouse Publishing, 1925), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>78‚Äì79</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In her first theological text, ''[[Scivias]]'' (&quot;Know the Ways&quot;), Hildegard describes her struggle within:&lt;blockquote&gt;But I, though I saw and heard these things, refused to write for a long time through doubt and bad opinion and the diversity of human words, not with stubbornness but in the exercise of humility, until, laid low by the scourge of God, I fell upon a bed of sickness; then, compelled at last by many illnesses, and by the witness of a certain noble maiden of good conduct [the nun Richardis von Stade] and of that man whom I had secretly sought and found, as mentioned above, I set my hand to the writing</span>
				<span class='text'>While I was doing it, I sensed, as I mentioned before, the deep profundity of scriptural exposition; and, raising myself from illness by the strength I received, I brought this work to a close ‚Äì though just barely ‚Äì in ten years</span>
				<span class='text'>(</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> And I spoke and wrote these things not by the invention of my heart or that of any other person, but as by the secret mysteries of God I heard and received them in the heavenly places</span>
				<span class='text'>And again I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, 'Cry out therefore, and write thus!'&lt;ref&gt;Hildegard von Bingen, ''Scivias,'' trans</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It was between November 1147 and February 1148 at the synod in Trier that [[Pope Eugene III|Pope Eugenius]] heard about Hildegard‚Äôs writings</span>
				<span class='text'>It was from this that she received Papal approval to document her visions as revelations from the Holy Spirit giving her instant credence</span>
				<span class='text'>efore Hildegard‚Äôs death, a problem arose with the clergy of Mainz</span>
				<span class='text'>A man buried in Rupertsburg had died after excommunication from the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, the clergy wanted to remove his body from the sacred ground</span>
				<span class='text'>Hildegard did not accept this idea, replying that it was a sin and that the man had been reconciled to the church at the time of his death</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Visionary theology===Hildegard's most significant works were her three volumes of visionary theology: ''[[Scivias]]'' (&quot;Know the Ways&quot;, composed 1142-1151), ''Liber Vitae Meritorum'' (&quot;Book of Life's Merits&quot; or &quot;Book of the Rewards of Life&quot;, composed 1158-1163); and ''Liber Divinorum Operum'' (&quot;Book of Divine Works&quot;, also known as ''De operatione Dei'', &quot;On God's Activity&quot;, composed 1163/4-1172 or 1174)</span>
				<span class='text'>In these volumes, the last of which was completed when she was well into her seventies, Hildegard first describes each vision, whose details are often strange and enigmatic; and then interprets their theological contents in the words of the &quot;voice of the Living Light</span>

				<span class='text'>59-61</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hildegard began to record her visionary experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Scivias]]'' is structured into three parts of unequal length</span>
				<span class='text'>The first part (six visions) chronicles the order of God's creation: the Creation and Fall of Adam and Eve, the structure of the universe (famously described as an &quot;egg&quot;), the relationship between body and soul, God's relationship to his people through the Synagogue, and the choirs of angels</span>
				<span class='text'>The second part (seven visions) describes the order of redemption: the coming of Christ the Redeemer, the [[Trinity]], the Church as the Bride of Christ and the Mother of the Faithful in [[baptism]] and [[confirmation]], the orders of the Church, Christ's sacrifice on the Cross and the [[Eucharist]], and the fight against the devil</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, the third part (thirteen visions) recapitulates the history of salvation told in the first two parts, symbolized as a building adorned with various allegorical figures and virtues</span>
				<span class='text'>It concludes with the Symphony of Heaven, an early version of Hildegard's musical compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>ortions of the uncompleted work were read aloud to [[Pope Eugenius III]] at the Synod of Trier in 1148, after which he sent Hildegard a letter with his blessing</span>

				<span class='text'>]Hildegard's last and grandest visionary work had its genesis in one of the few times she experienced something like an ecstatic loss of consciousness</span>
				<span class='text'>As she described it in an autobiographical passage included in her Vita, sometime in about 1163, she received &quot;an extraordinary mystical vision&quot; in which was revealed the &quot;sprinkling drops of sweet rain&quot; that John the Evangelist experienced when he wrote, &quot;In the beginning was the Word</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (John 1:1)</span>
				<span class='text'>Hildegard perceived that this Word was the key to the &quot;Work of God&quot;, of which humankind is the pinnacle</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;Book of Divine Works&quot;, therefore, became in many ways an extended explication of the Prologue to John's Gospel</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The ten visions of this work's three parts are cosmic in scale, often populated by the grand allegorical female figures representing Divine Love (''Caritas'') or Wisdom (''Sapientia'')</span>
				<span class='text'>The first of these opens the work with a salvo of poetic and visionary images, swirling about to characterize the dynamic activity of God within the scope of his salvation-historical work</span>
				<span class='text'>The remaining three visions of the first part introduce the famous image of a human being standing astride the spheres that make up the universe, and detail the intricate relationships between the human as microcosm and the universe as macrocosm</span>
				<span class='text'>This culminates in the final chapters of Part One, Vision Four with Hildegard's direct rumination on the meaning of &quot;In the beginning was the Word</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (John 1:1)</span>
				<span class='text'>The single vision that comprises the whole of Part Two stretches that rumination back to the opening of Genesis, and forms an extended meditation on the six days of the creation of the world</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, the five visions of the third part take up again the building imagery of ''Scivias'' to describe the course of salvation history</span>

				<span class='text'>In addition to the ''[[Ordo Virtutum]],'' sixty-nine musical compositions, each with its own original poetic text, survive, and at least four other texts are known, though their musical notation has been lost</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Its style is characterized by soaring melodies that can push the boundaries of the more staid ranges of traditional Gregorian chant</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Hildegard's music is often thought to stand outside the normal practices of monophonic monastic chant,&lt;ref name=&quot;holsinger&quot;/&gt; current researchers are also exploring ways in which it may be viewed in comparison with her contemporaries, such as Hermannus Contractus</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Another feature of Hildegard's music that both reflects twelfth-century evolutions of chant and pushes those evolutions further is that it is highly [[melismatic]], often with recurrent melodic units</span>
				<span class='text'>Scholars such as Margot Fassler, Marianne Richert Pfau, and Beverly Lomer also note the intimate relationship between music and text in Hildegard's compositions, whose rhetorical features are often more distinct than is common in twelfth-century chant</span>

				<span class='text'>92‚Äì125</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to him, the poetry and music of Hildegard‚Äôs Symphonia would therefore be concerned with the anatomy of female desire thus described as Sapphonic, or pertaining to [[Sappho]], connecting her to a history of female rhetoricians</span>

				<span class='text'>''Hildegard's Healing Plants: From Her Medieval Classic Physica'' (Massachusetts: Beacon Press, 2001), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>xi‚Äìxii&lt;/ref&gt;Hildegard catalogued both her theory and practice in two works</span>
				<span class='text'>The first, ''Physica,'' contains nine books that describe the scientific and medicinal properties of various plants, stones, fish, reptiles, and animals</span>
				<span class='text'>The second, ''Causae et Curae'', is an exploration of the human body, its connections to the rest of the natural world, and the causes and cures of various diseases</span>

				<span class='text'>Priscilla Throop (Rochester, Vermont: Healing Arts Press, 1998)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Hildegard documented various medical practices in these books, including the use of bleeding and home remedies for many common ailments</span>
				<span class='text'>She also explains remedies for common agricultural injuries such as burns, fractures, dislocations, and cuts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Sweet/&gt; Hildegard may have used the books to teach assistants at the monastery</span>
				<span class='text'>These books are historically significant because they show areas of medieval medicine that were not well documented because their practitioners (mainly women) rarely wrote in Latin</span>
				<span class='text'>n addition to its wealth of practical evidence, ''Causae et Curae'' is also noteworthy for its organizational scheme</span>
				<span class='text'>Its first part sets the work within the context of the creation of the cosmos and then humanity as its summit, and the constant interplay of the human person as microcosm both physically and spiritually with the macrocosm of the universe informs all of Hildegard‚Äôs approach</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Glaze/&gt; Her hallmark is to emphasize the vital connection between the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù health of the natural world and the holistic health of the human person</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, when she approached medicine as a type of gardening, it was not just as an analogy</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather, Hildegard understood the plants and elements of the garden as direct counterparts to the humors and elements within the human body, whose imbalance led to illness and disease</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Sweet/&gt;Thus, the nearly three hundred chapters of the second book of ''Causae et Curae'' ‚Äúexplore the etiology, or causes, of disease as well as human sexuality, psychology, and physiology</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù&lt;ref name=Glaze/&gt; In this section, she give specific instructions for bleeding based on various factors, including gender, the phase of the moon (bleeding is best done when moon is waning), the place of disease (use veins near diseased organ of body part) or prevention (big veins in arms), and how much blood to take (described in imprecise measurements, like ‚Äúthe amount that a thirsty person can swallow in one gulp‚Äù)</span>
				<span class='text'>She even includes bleeding instructions for animals to keep them healthy</span>
				<span class='text'>In the third and fourth sections, Hildegard describes treatments for malignant and minor problems and diseases according to the humoral theory, again including information on animal health</span>
				<span class='text'>The fifth section is about diagnosis and prognosis, which includes instructions to check the patient‚Äôs blood, pulse, urine and stool</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Sweet/&gt; Finally, the sixth section documents a lunar horoscope to provide an additional means of prognosis for both disease and other medical conditions, such as conception and the outcome of pregnancy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Glaze/&gt; For example, she indicates that a waxing moon is good for human conception and is also good for sowing seeds for plants (sowing seeds is the plant equivalent of conception)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Sweet/&gt; Elsewhere, Hildegard is even said to have stressed the value of boiling drinking water in an attempt to prevent infection</span>

				<span class='text'>2004</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;As Hildegard elaborates the medical and scientific relationship between the human microcosm and the macrocosm of the universe, she often focuses on interrelated patterns of four: ‚Äúthe four elements (fire, air, water, and earth), the four seasons, the four humors, the four zones of the earth, and the four major winds</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù&lt;ref name=Glaze/&gt; Although she inherited the basic framework of [[humorism|humoral theory]] from ancient medicine, however, Hildegard‚Äôs conception of the hierarchical interbalance of the four humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile) was unique, based on their correspondence to ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù and ‚Äúinferior‚Äù elements‚Äîblood and phlegm corresponding to the ‚Äúcelestial‚Äù elements of fire and air, and the two biles corresponding to the ‚Äúterrestrial‚Äù elements of water and earth</span>
				<span class='text'>Hildegard understood the disease-causing imbalance of these humors to result from the improper dominance of the subordinate humors</span>
				<span class='text'>This disharmony reflects that introduced by Adam and Eve in the Fall, which for Hildegard marked the indelible entrance of disease and humoral imbalance into humankind</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Glaze/&gt; As she writes in ''Causae et Curae'' c</span>
				<span class='text'>42:&lt;blockquote&gt;It happens that certain men suffer diverse illnesses</span>
				<span class='text'>This comes from the phlegm which is superabundant within them</span>
				<span class='text'>For if man had remained in paradise, he would not have had the ''flegmata'' within his body, from which many evils proceed, but his flesh would been whole and without dark humor [''livor'']</span>
				<span class='text'>However, because he consented to evil and relinquished good, he was made into a likeness of the earth, which produces good and useful herbs, as well as bad and useless ones, and which has in itself both good and evil moistures</span>
				<span class='text'>From tasting evil, the blood of the sons of Adam was turned into the poison of semen, out of which the sons of man are begotten</span>
				<span class='text'>And therefore their flesh is ulcerated and permeable [to disease]</span>
				<span class='text'>These sores and openings create a certain storm and smoky moisture in men, from which the ''flegmata'' arise and coagulate, which then introduce diverse infirmities to the human body</span>
				<span class='text'>All this arose from the first evil, which man began at the start, because if Adam had remained in paradise, he would have had the sweetest health, and the best dwelling-place, just as the strongest balsam emits the best odor; but on the contrary, man now has within himself poison and phlegm and diverse illnesses</span>
