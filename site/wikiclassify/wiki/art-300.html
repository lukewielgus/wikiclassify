				<span class='text'>-&gt;Born in [[Seattle]], Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1961, he enlisted in the US Army and trained as a [[paratrooper]] in the [[101st Airborne Division]]; he was granted an honorable discharge the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon afterward, he moved to [[Clarksville, Tennessee]], and began playing gigs on the [[chitlin' circuit]], earning a place in [[the Isley Brothers]]' backing band and later with [[Little Richard]], with whom he continued to work through mid-1965</span>
				<span class='text'>He then played with [[Curtis Knight|Curtis Knight and the Squires]] before moving to England in late 1966 after being discovered by [[Linda Keith]], who in turn interested bassist [[Chas Chandler]] of [[the Animals]] in becoming his first manager</span>
				<span class='text'>Within months, Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]]: &quot;[[Hey Joe]]&quot;, &quot;[[Purple Haze]]&quot;, and &quot;[[The Wind Cries Mary]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album, ''[[Electric Ladyland]]'', reached number one in the US; it was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his first and only number one album</span>
				<span class='text'>The world's highest-paid performer, he headlined the [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] in 1969 and the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|Isle of Wight Festival]] in 1970 before [[Death of Jimi Hendrix|his accidental death]] from [[barbiturate]]-related [[asphyxia]] on September 18, 1970, at the age of 27</span>
				<span class='text'>endrix was inspired musically by American [[rock and roll]] and [[electric blues]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He favored [[Distortion (music)|overdriven]] amplifiers with high volume and [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], and was instrumental in utilizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by [[Guitar feedback|guitar amplifier feedback]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He helped to popularize the use of a [[wah-wah pedal]] in mainstream rock, and was the first artist to use [[stereophonic sound|stereophonic]] [[Phaser (effect)|phasing]] effects in music recordings</span>
				<span class='text'>Holly George-Warren of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' commented: &quot;Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source</span>
				<span class='text'>Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|p=428}}Hendrix was the recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1967, readers of ''[[Melody Maker]]'' voted him the Pop Musician of the Year, and in 1968, ''Rolling Stone'' declared him the Performer of the Year</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Disc (magazine)|Disc and Music Echo]]'' honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970, ''Guitar Player'' named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year</span>
				<span class='text'>The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2005</span>
				<span class='text'>''Rolling Stone'' ranked the band's three studio albums, ''[[Are You Experienced]]'', ''[[Axis: Bold as Love]]'', and ''[[Electric Ladyland]]'', among the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|100 greatest albums of all time]], and they ranked Hendrix as the greatest guitarist and the sixth greatest artist of all time</span>
