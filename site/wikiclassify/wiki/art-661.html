				<span class='text'>Later, Keaton changed his middle name to &quot;Francis&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Meade16/&gt; His father was [[Joe Keaton|Joseph Hallie &quot;Joe&quot; Keaton]], who owned a traveling show with [[Harry Houdini]] called the Mohawk Indian Medicine Company, which performed on stage and sold [[patent medicine]] on the side</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to a frequently repeated story, which may be apocryphal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>cm</span>
				<span class='text'>om/thismonth/article/?cid=161352 Turner Classic Movies website]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Keaton acquired the nickname &quot;Buster&quot; at about eighteen months of age</span>
				<span class='text'>Keaton told interviewer [[Fletcher Markle]] that  Houdini happened to be present one day when the young Keaton took a tumble down a long flight of stairs without injury</span>
				<span class='text'>After the infant sat up and shook off his experience, Houdini remarked, &quot;That was a real buster!&quot; According to Keaton, in those days, the word &quot;buster&quot; was used to refer to a spill or a fall that had the potential to produce injury</span>
				<span class='text'>After this, it was Keaton's father who began to use the nickname to refer to the youngster</span>
				<span class='text'>Keaton retold the anecdote over the years, including a 1964 interview with the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s ''[[Telescope (TV series)|Telescope]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Telescope: Deadpan an interview with Buster Keaton'', 1964 interview of Buster and Eleanor Keaton by [[Fletcher Markle]] for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;At the age of three, Keaton began performing with his parents in ''The Three Keatons''</span>
				<span class='text'>He first appeared on stage in 1899 in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The act was mainly a comedy sketch</span>
				<span class='text'>Myra played the saxophone to one side, while Joe and Buster performed on center stage</span>
				<span class='text'>The young Keaton would goad his father by disobeying him, and the elder Keaton would respond by throwing him against the scenery, into the orchestra pit, or even into the audience</span>
				<span class='text'>A suitcase handle was sewn into Keaton's clothing to aid with the constant tossing</span>
				<span class='text'>The act evolved as Keaton learned to take trick falls safely; he was rarely injured or bruised on stage</span>
				<span class='text'>This knockabout style of comedy led to accusations of [[child abuse]], and occasionally, arrest</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Buster Keaton was always able to show the authorities that he had no bruises or broken bones</span>
				<span class='text'>He was eventually billed as &quot;The Little Boy Who Can't Be Damaged,&quot; with the overall act being advertised as &quot;'The Roughest Act That Was Ever in the History of the Stage</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1914, Keaton told the ''[[Detroit News]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;The secret is in landing limp and breaking the fall with a foot or a hand</span>
				<span class='text'>It's a knack</span>
				<span class='text'>I started so young that landing right is second nature with me</span>
				<span class='text'>Several times I'd have been killed if I hadn't been able to land like a cat</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;bk&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Keaton claimed he was having so much fun that he would sometimes begin laughing as his father threw him across the stage</span>
				<span class='text'>Noticing that this drew fewer laughs from the audience, he adopted his famous deadpan expression whenever he was working</span>

				<span class='text'>According to one biographer, Keaton was made to go to school while performing in New York, but only attended for part of one day</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite tangles with the law and a disastrous tour of [[music hall]]s in the United Kingdom, Keaton was a rising star in the theater</span>
				<span class='text'>Keaton stated that he learned to read and write late, and was taught by his mother</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time he was 21, his father's alcoholism threatened the reputation of the family act,&lt;ref name=&quot;bk&quot;/&gt; so Keaton and his mother, Myra, left for New York, where Buster Keaton's career swiftly moved from vaudeville to film</span>

				<span class='text'>gg|thumb|A clip from the beginning of ''Cops'']]In February 1917, Keaton met [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle]] at the Talmadge Studios in New York City, where Arbuckle was under contract to [[Joseph Schenck|Joseph M</span>
				<span class='text'>Schenck]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Joe Keaton disapproved of films, and Buster also had reservations about the medium</span>
				<span class='text'>During his first meeting with Arbuckle, he asked to borrow one of the cameras to get a feel for how it worked</span>
				<span class='text'>He took the camera back to his hotel room, dismantled and reassembled it</span>
				<span class='text'>With this rough understanding of the mechanics of the moving pictures, he returned the next day, camera in hand, asking for work</span>
				<span class='text'>He was hired as a co-star and gag man, making his first appearance in ''[[The Butcher Boy (1917 film)|The Butcher Boy]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Keaton later claimed that he was soon Arbuckle's second director and his entire gag department</span>
				<span class='text'>He appeared in a total of 14 Arbuckle shorts, running into 1920</span>
				<span class='text'>They were popular and, contrary to Keaton's later reputation as &quot;The Great Stone Face&quot;, he often smiled and even laughed in them</span>
				<span class='text'>Keaton and Arbuckle became close friends, and Keaton was one of few people to defend Arbuckle's character during accusations that he was responsible for the death of actress [[Virginia Rappe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!-- Edwards says Arbuckle and Keaton met at Talmadge; the IMDB says &quot;Butcher Boy&quot; was made at Colony Studios in NYC --&gt;In 1920, ''[[The Saphead]]'' was released, in which Keaton had his first starring role in a full-length feature</span>
				<span class='text'>It was based on a successful play, ''The New Henrietta'', which had already been filmed once, under the title ''The Lamb'', with [[Douglas Fairbanks]] playing the lead</span>
				<span class='text'>Fairbanks recommended Keaton to take the role for the remake five years later, since the film was to have a comic slant</span>
				<span class='text'>fter Keaton's successful work with Arbuckle, Schenck gave him his own production unit, Buster Keaton Comedies</span>
				<span class='text'>He made a series of two-reel comedies, including ''[[One Week (1920 film)|One Week]]'' (1920), ''[[The Playhouse (film)|The Playhouse]]'' (1921), ''[[Cops (1922)|Cops]]'' (1922), and ''[[The Electric House]]'' (1922)</span>
				<span class='text'>Keaton then moved to full-length features</span>

				<span class='text'>]Keaton's writers included [[Clyde Bruckman]], Joseph Mitchell, and Jean Havez, but the most ingenious gags were generally conceived by Keaton himself</span>
				<span class='text'>Comedy director [[Leo McCarey]], recalling the freewheeling days of making [[slapstick]] comedies, said, &quot;All of us tried to steal each other's gagmen</span>
				<span class='text'>But we had no luck with Keaton, because he thought up his best gags himself and we couldn't steal ''him!''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Maltin, Leonard, The Great Movie Comedians, Bell Publishing, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; The more adventurous ideas called for dangerous stunts, performed by Keaton at great physical risk</span>
				<span class='text'>During the railroad water-tank scene in ''[[Sherlock Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>]'', Keaton broke his neck when a torrent of water fell on him from a water tower, but he did not realize it until years afterward</span>
				<span class='text'>A scene from ''[[Steamboat Bill Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>]'' required Keaton to run into the shot and stand still on a particular spot</span>
				<span class='text'>Then, the facade of a two-story building toppled forward on top of Keaton</span>
				<span class='text'>Keaton's character emerged unscathed, thanks to a single open window</span>
				<span class='text'>The stunt required precision, because the prop house weighed two tons, and the window only offered a few inches of clearance around Keaton's body</span>
				<span class='text'>The sequence furnished one of the most memorable images of his career</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>like a number that has always been searching for the right equation</span>
				<span class='text'>Look at his face‚Äîas beautiful but as inhuman as a butterfly‚Äîand you see that utter failure to identify sentiment</span>

				<span class='text'>767</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Gilberto Perez commented on &quot;Keaton's genius as an actor to keep a face so nearly deadpan and yet render it, by subtle inflections, so vividly expressive of inner life</span>
				<span class='text'>His large deep eyes are the most eloquent feature; with merely a stare he can convey a wide range of emotions, from longing to mistrust, from puzzlement to sorrow</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Perez Gilberto 'The Material Ghost‚ÄîOn Keaton and Chaplin' 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Anthony Lane]] also noted Keaton's body language: &quot;The traditional Buster stance requires that he remain upstanding, full of backbone, looking ahead</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[in ''[[The General (1926 film)|The General]]''] he clambers onto the roof of his locomotive and leans gently forward to scan the terrain, with the breeze in his hair and adventure zipping toward him around the next bend</span>
				<span class='text'> it is the ''angle'' that you remember: the figure perfectly straight but tilted forward, like the Spirit of Ecstasy on the hood of a Rolls-Royce</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[in ''[[The Three Ages]]''], he drives a low-grade automobile over a bump in the road, and the car just ''crumbles'' beneath him</span>
				<span class='text'> Rerun it on video, and you can see Buster riding the collapse like a surfer, hanging onto the steering wheel, coming beautifully to rest as the wave of wreckage breaks</span>

				<span class='text'>560-561&lt;/ref&gt;  Film historian [[Jeffrey Vance]] writes, ‚ÄúBuster Keaton‚Äôs comedy endures not just because he had a face that belongs on Mount Rushmore, at once hauntingly immovable and classically American, but because that face was attached to one of the most gifted actors and directors who ever graced the screen</span>
				<span class='text'>Evolved from the knockabout upbringing of the vaudeville stage, Keaton‚Äôs comedy is a whirlwind of hilarious, technically precise, adroitly executed, and surprising gags, very often set against a backdrop of visually stunning set pieces and locations‚Äîall this masked behind his unflinching, stoic veneer</span>

				<span class='text'>Keaton endured this treatment for two more feature films, and then exchanged his independent setup for employment at Hollywood's biggest studio, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM)</span>

				<span class='text'>Keaton parodied the tired formula of the melodramatic transformation from bad guy to good guy, through which went Hart's character, known as &quot;the good badman&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|With [[Charlotte Greenwood]] in one of his first &quot;talkies&quot;, 1931's ''[[Parlor, Bedroom and Bath]]'']]Keaton signed with MGM in 1928, a business decision that he would later call the worst of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>He realized too late that the [[studio system]] MGM represented would severely limit his creative input</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance, the studio refused his request to make his early project, ''[[Spite Marriage]]'', as a sound film and after the studio converted, he was obliged to adhere to dialogue-laden scripts</span>
				<span class='text'>However, MGM did allow Keaton some creative participation on his last originally developed/written silent film ''[[The Cameraman]]'', 1928, which was his first project under contract with them, but hired [[Edward Sedgwick]] as the official director</span>
				<span class='text'>eaton was forced to use a stunt double during some of the more dangerous scenes, something he had never done in his heyday, as MGM wanted badly to protect its investment</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Stuntmen don't get laughs,&quot; Keaton had said</span>
				<span class='text'>Some of his most financially successful films for the studio were during this period</span>
				<span class='text'>MGM tried teaming the laconic Keaton with the rambunctious [[Jimmy Durante]] in a series of films, ''[[The Passionate Plumber]]'', ''[[Speak Easily]]'', and ''[[What! No Beer?]]'' The latter would be Keaton's last starring feature in his home country</span>
				<span class='text'>The films proved popular</span>
				<span class='text'>(Thirty years later, both Keaton and Durante had cameo roles in ''[[It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World]]'', albeit not in the same scenes</span>
				<span class='text'>[[File:Speak Easily (1932) 1</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|250px|Keaton with [[Thelma Todd]] and [[Jimmy Durante]] in ''[[Speak Easily]]'']]In the first Keaton pictures with sound, he and his fellow actors would shoot each scene three times: one in English, one in Spanish, and one in either French or German</span>
				<span class='text'>The actors would phonetically memorize the foreign-language scripts a few lines at a time and shoot immediately after</span>
				<span class='text'>This is discussed in the TCM documentary ''Buster Keaton: So Funny it Hurt'', with Keaton complaining about having to shoot lousy films not just once, but three times</span>
				<span class='text'>eaton was so demoralized during the production of 1933's ''What! No Beer?'' that MGM fired him after the filming was complete, despite the film being a resounding hit</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1934, Keaton accepted an offer to make an independent film in Paris, ''[[Le Roi des Champs-√âlys√©es]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period, he made another film, in England, ''[[The Invader (1935 film)|The Invader]]'' (released in the United States as ''An Old Spanish Custom'' in 1936)</span>
				<span class='text'>===Educational Pictures====Upon Keaton's return to Hollywood, he made a screen comeback in a series of 16 two-reel comedies for [[Educational Pictures]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of these are simple visual comedies, with many of the gags supplied by Keaton himself, often recycling ideas from his family vaudeville act and his earlier films</span>

				<span class='text'>When the series lapsed in 1937, Keaton returned to MGM as a gag writer, including the [[Marx Brothers]] films ''[[At the Circus]]'' (1939) and ''[[Go West (1940 film)|Go West]]'' (1940), and providing material for [[Red Skelton]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The director was usually [[Jules White]], whose emphasis on [[slapstick]] and [[farce]] made most of these films resemble White's [[Three Stooges]] comedies</span>
				<span class='text'>Keaton's personal favorite was the series' debut entry, ''[[Pest from the West]]'', a shorter, tighter remake of Keaton's little-viewed 1935 feature ''The Invader''; it was directed not by White but by [[Del Lord]], a veteran director for [[Mack Sennett]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Moviegoers and exhibitors welcomed Keaton's Columbia comedies, proving that the comedian had not lost his appeal</span>
				<span class='text'>However, taken as a whole, Keaton's Columbia shorts rank as the worst comedies he made, an assessment he concurred with in his autobiography</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Okuda&quot;/&gt;====1940s and feature films====Keaton's personal life had stabilized with his 1940 marriage, and now he was taking life a little easier, abandoning Columbia for the less strenuous field of feature films</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the 1940s, Keaton played character roles in both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; features</span>
				<span class='text'>He made his last starring feature ''El Moderno Barba Azul'' (1946) in Mexico; the film was a low budget production, and it may not have been seen in the United States until its release on VHS in the 1980s, under the title [[Boom_in_the_Moon|''Boom In The Moon'']]</span>
				<span class='text'>Critics rediscovered Keaton in 1949 and producers occasionally hired him for bigger &quot;prestige&quot; pictures</span>
				<span class='text'>He had cameos in such films as ''[[In the Good Old Summertime]]'' (1949), ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950), and ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956)</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''In The Good Old Summertime'', Keaton personally directed the stars [[Judy Garland]] and [[Van Johnson]] in their first scene together where they bump into each other on the street</span>
				<span class='text'>Keaton invented comedy bits where Johnson keeps trying to apologize to a seething Garland, but winds up messing up her hairdo and tearing her dress</span>
				<span class='text'>eaton also had a cameo as Jimmy, appearing near the end of the film ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963)</span>
				<span class='text'>Jimmy assists [[Spencer Tracy]]'s character, Captain C</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>Culpepper, by readying Culpepper's ultimately-unused boat for his abortive escape</span>
				<span class='text'>(The restored version of that film, released in 2013, contains a restored scene where Jimmy and Culpeper talk on the telephone</span>
				<span class='text'>Lost after the comedy epic's &quot;[[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]]&quot; exhibition, the audio of that scene was discovered, and combined with still pictures to recreate the scene</span>
				<span class='text'> Keaton was given more screen time in ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (film)|A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' (1966)</span>
				<span class='text'>The appearance, since it was released after his death, was his posthumous swansong</span>
				<span class='text'>eaton also appeared in a comedy routine about two inept stage musicians in [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' (1952), recalling the vaudeville of ''[[The Playhouse (film)|The Playhouse]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>With the exception of ''Seeing Stars'', a minor publicity film produced in 1922, ''Limelight'' was the only time in which the two would ever appear together on film</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1949, comedian [[Ed Wynn]] invited Keaton to appear on his [[CBS Television]] comedy-variety show, ''The Ed Wynn Show'', which was televised live on the West Coast</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Kinescope]]s were made for distribution of the programs to other parts of the country since there was no transcontinental [[coaxial cable]] until September 1951</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1950, Keaton had a successful television series, ''[[The Buster Keaton Show]]'', which was broadcast live on a local Los Angeles station</span>
				<span class='text'>An attempt to recreate the first series on film as ''Life with Buster Keaton'' (1951), which allowed the program to be broadcast nationwide, was less well received</span>
				<span class='text'>He also appeared in the early television series ''[[Faye Emerson's Wonderful Town]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>A theatrical feature film, ''The Misadventures of Buster Keaton'', was fashioned from the series</span>
				<span class='text'>Keaton said he canceled the filmed series himself because he was unable to create enough fresh material to produce a new show each week</span>
				<span class='text'>Keaton also appeared on Ed Wynn's variety show</span>
				<span class='text'>At the age of 55, he successfully recreated one of the stunts of his youth, in which he propped one foot onto a table, then swung the second foot up next to it, and held the awkward position in midair for a moment before crashing to the stage floor</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[I've Got a Secret]]'' host [[Garry Moore]] recalled, &quot;I asked (Keaton) how he did all those falls, and he said, 'I'll show you'</span>
				<span class='text'>He opened his jacket and he was all bruised</span>
				<span class='text'>So that's how he did it‚Äîit ''hurt''‚Äîbut you had to care enough not to care</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In 1952 Keaton appeared with [[Charles Chaplin]] in ''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>nlike his contemporary [[Harold Lloyd]], who kept his films from being televised, Keaton's periodic television appearances helped to revive interest in his silent films in the 1950s and 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1954, Keaton played his first television dramatic role in &quot;The Awakening&quot;, an episode of the [[Television syndication|syndicated]] [[anthology series]] ''[[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'> Presents]]''</span>
