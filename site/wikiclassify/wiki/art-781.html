				<span class='text'>He first attracted notice in [[vaudeville]] in the US and then as &quot;Harry Handcuff Houdini&quot; on a tour of Europe, where he challenged police forces to keep him locked up</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon he extended his repertoire to include chains, ropes slung from skyscrapers, [[straitjacket]]s under water, and having to escape from and [[apnea|hold his breath]] inside a sealed milk can</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1904, thousands watched as he tried to escape from special [[handcuff]]s commissioned by London's ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', keeping them in suspense for an hour</span>
				<span class='text'>Another stunt saw him [[Premature burial|buried alive]] and only just able to claw himself to the surface, emerging in a state of near-breakdown</span>
				<span class='text'>While many suspected that these escapes were faked, Houdini presented himself as the scourge of fake [[spiritualist]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>As President of the [[Society of American Magicians]], he was keen to uphold professional standards and expose fraudulent artists</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also quick to sue anyone who pirated his escape stunts</span>
				<span class='text'>oudini made several movies, but quit acting when it failed to bring in money</span>

				<span class='text'>Bess was initially courted by Dash, but she and Houdini married in 1894, with Bess replacing Dash in the act, which became known as &quot;The Houdinis</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; For the rest of Houdini's performing career, Bess worked as his stage assistant</span>
				<span class='text'>oudini's big break came in 1899 when he met manager [[Martin Beck (vaudeville)|Martin Beck]] in St</span>
				<span class='text'>Paul, Minnesota</span>
				<span class='text'>Impressed by Houdini's [[handcuffs]] act, Beck advised him to concentrate on escape acts and booked him on the [[Orpheum Circuit|Orpheum]] [[vaudeville]] circuit</span>
				<span class='text'>Within months, he was performing at the top vaudeville houses in the country</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1900, Beck arranged for Houdini to tour Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>After some days of unsuccessful interviews in London, Houdini managed to interest Dundas Slater, then manager of the [[Alhambra Theatre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He gave a demonstration of escape from handcuffs at Scotland Yard, and succeeded in baffling the police so effectively that he was booked at the Alhambra for six months</span>

				<span class='text'>With his new-found wealth, Houdini purchased a dress said to have been made for [[Queen Victoria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He then arranged a grand reception where he presented his mother in the dress to all their relatives</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;secret&quot;/&gt; For most of his career, Houdini was a headline act in [[vaudeville]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For many years, he was the highest-paid performer in American vaudeville</span>

				<span class='text'>Houdini was magic's greatest visionary</span>
				<span class='text'>He sought to create a large, unified national network of professional and amateur magicians</span>
				<span class='text'>Wherever he traveled, Houdini gave a lengthy formal address to the local magic club, made speeches, and usually threw a banquet for the members at his own expense</span>
				<span class='text'>He said &quot;The Magicians Clubs as a rule are small: they are weak</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ut if we were amalgamated into one big body the society would be stronger, and it would mean making the small clubs powerful and worth while</span>
				<span class='text'>Members would find a welcome wherever they happened to be and, conversely, the safeguard of a city-to-city hotline to track exposers and other undesirables</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;For most of 1916, while on his vaudeville tour, Houdini, at his own expense, had been recruiting local magic clubs to join the S</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>in an effort to revitalize what he felt was a weak organization</span>
				<span class='text'>Houdini persuaded groups in Buffalo, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Kansas City to join</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> whose assemblies now number in the hundreds</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1917, he signed Assembly Number Three's charter into existence, and that charter and this club continue to provide Chicago magicians with a connection to each other and to their past</span>
				<span class='text'>Houdini dined with, addressed, and got pledges from similar clubs in Detroit, Rochester, Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Cincinnati and elsewhere</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the biggest movement ever in the history of magic</span>
				<span class='text'>In places where no clubs existed, he rounded up individual magicians, introduced them to each other, and urged them into the fold</span>
				<span class='text'>y the end of 1916, magicians' clubs in San Francisco and other cities that Houdini had not visited were offering to become assemblies</span>
				<span class='text'>He had created the richest and longest-surviving organization of magicians in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>It now embraces almost 6,000 dues-paying members and almost 300 assemblies worldwide</span>

				<span class='text'>The escape attempt dragged on for over an hour, during which Houdini emerged from his &quot;ghost house&quot; (a small screen used to conceal the method of his escape) several times</span>
				<span class='text'>On one occasion he asked if the cuffs could be removed so he could take off his coat</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Mirror'' representative, Frank Parker, refused, saying Houdini could gain an advantage if he saw how the cuffs were unlocked</span>
				<span class='text'>Houdini promptly took out a pen-knife and, holding the knife in his teeth, used it to cut his coat from his body</span>
				<span class='text'>Some 56&amp;nbsp;minutes later, Houdini's wife appeared on stage and gave him a kiss</span>
				<span class='text'>Many thought that in her mouth was the key to unlock the special handcuffs</span>
				<span class='text'>However, it has since been suggested that Bess did not in fact enter the stage at all, and that this theory is unlikely due to the size of the 6-inch key&lt;ref&gt;The Secret Life of Houdini, Kaulush &amp; Sloman, 2006</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Houdini then went back behind the curtain</span>
				<span class='text'>After an hour and ten minutes, Houdini emerged free</span>
				<span class='text'>As he was paraded on the shoulders of the cheering crowd, he broke down and wept</span>
				<span class='text'>Houdini later said it was the most difficult escape of his career</span>

				<span class='text'>Goldston goes on to claim that Bess begged the key from the ''Mirror'' representative, then slipped it to Houdini in a glass of water</span>
				<span class='text'>It was stated in the book ''The Secret Life of Houdini'' that the key required to open the specially designed Mirror handcuffs was 6&quot; long, and could not have been smuggled to Houdini in a glass of water</span>
				<span class='text'>Goldston offered no proof of his account, and many modern biographers have found evidence (notably in the custom design of the handcuffs) that the ''Mirror'' challenge may have been arranged by Houdini and that his long struggle to escape was pure showmanship</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In this act, Houdini was handcuffed and sealed inside an over-sized milk can filled with water and made his escape behind a curtain</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Houdini performing the Chinese Water Torture Cell]]Around 1912, the vast number of imitators prompted Houdini to replace his milk can act with the Chinese water torture cell</span>
				<span class='text'>In this escape, Houdini's feet were locked in stocks, and he was lowered upside down into a tank filled with water</span>
				<span class='text'>The mahogany and metal cell featured a glass front, through which audiences could clearly see Houdini</span>
				<span class='text'>The stocks were locked to the top of the cell, and a curtain concealed his escape</span>
				<span class='text'>In the earliest version of the torture cell, a metal cage was lowered into the cell, and Houdini was enclosed inside that</span>
				<span class='text'>While making the escape more difficult - the cage prevented Houdini from turning - the cage bars also offered protection should the front glass break</span>
				<span class='text'>The original cell was built in England, where Houdini first performed the escape for an audience of one person as part of a one-act play he called &quot;Houdini Upside Down</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This was so he could copyright the effect and have grounds to sue imitators, which he did</span>
				<span class='text'>While the escape was advertised as &quot;The Chinese Water Torture Cell&quot; or &quot;The Water Torture Cell,&quot; Houdini always referred to it as &quot;the Upside Down&quot; or &quot;USD&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The first public performance of the USD was at the Circus Busch in Berlin, on September 21, 1912</span>
				<span class='text'>Houdini continued to perform the escape until his death in 1926</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;secret&quot;/&gt;===Suspended straitjacket escape===One of Houdini's most popular publicity stunts was to have himself strapped into a regulation straitjacket and suspended by his ankles from a tall building or crane</span>
				<span class='text'>Houdini would then make his escape in full view of the assembled crowd</span>
				<span class='text'>In many cases, Houdini drew tens of thousands of onlookers who brought city traffic to a halt</span>
				<span class='text'>Houdini would sometimes ensure press coverage by performing the escape from the office building of a local newspaper</span>
				<span class='text'>In New York City, Houdini performed the suspended straitjacket escape from a crane being used to build the New York subway</span>
				<span class='text'>After flinging his body in the air, he escaped from the straitjacket</span>
				<span class='text'>Starting from when he was hoisted up in the air by the crane, to when the straitjacket was completely off, it took him two minutes and thirty-seven seconds</span>
				<span class='text'>There is film footage in the Library of Congress of Houdini performing the escape</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://lccn</span>
				<span class='text'>oc</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;, International news [1923 or 1924?]&lt;/ref&gt; Films of his escapes are also shown at The Houdini Museum in Scranton, PA</span>
				<span class='text'> After being battered against a building in high winds during one escape, Houdini performed the escape with a visible safety wire on his ankle so that he could be pulled away from the building if necessary</span>
				<span class='text'>The idea for the upside-down escape was given to Houdini by a young boy named [[Randolph Osborne Douglas]] (March 31, 1895&amp;nbsp;– December 5, 1956), when the two met at a performance at [[Sheffield]]'s Empire Theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;secret&quot;/&gt;===Overboard box escape===[[File:HoudiniSubmergedCrate</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Houdini prepares to do the overboard box escape circa 1912]]Another of Houdini's most famous publicity stunts was to escape from a nailed and roped packing crate after it had been lowered into water</span>
				<span class='text'>Houdini first performed the escape in New York's East River on July 7, 1912</span>
				<span class='text'>Police forbade him from using one of the piers, so Houdini hired a tugboat and invited press on board</span>
				<span class='text'>Houdini was locked in handcuffs and leg-irons, then nailed into the crate which was roped and weighed down with two hundred pounds of lead</span>
				<span class='text'>The crate was then lowered into the water</span>
				<span class='text'>Houdini escaped in 57 seconds</span>
				<span class='text'>The crate was pulled to the surface and found still to be intact, with the manacles inside</span>
				<span class='text'>Houdini performed this escape many times, and even performed a version on stage, first at Hamerstein's Roof Garden where a {{convert|5,500|USgal|l|adj=on}} tank was specially built, and later at the [[New York Hippodrome]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The first was near Santa Ana, California in 1915, and it almost cost Houdini his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Houdini was buried, without a casket, in a pit of earth six feet deep</span>
				<span class='text'>He became exhausted and panicked while trying to dig his way to the surface and called for help</span>
				<span class='text'>When his hand finally broke the surface, he fell unconscious and had to be pulled from the grave by his assistants</span>
				<span class='text'>Houdini wrote in his diary that the escape was &quot;very dangerous&quot; and that &quot;the weight of the earth is killing</span>

				<span class='text'>Houdini bettered Bey on August 5, 1926, by remaining in a sealed casket, or coffin, submerged in the swimming pool of New York's Hotel Shelton for one and a half hours</span>
				<span class='text'>Houdini claimed he did not use any trickery or supernatural powers to accomplish this feat, just controlled breathing</span>

				<span class='text'>Houdini escaped after being strapped in a straitjacket, sealed in a casket, and then buried in a large tank filled with sand</span>
				<span class='text'>While posters advertising the escape exist (playing off the Bey challenge by boasting &quot;Egyptian Fakirs Outdone!&quot;), it is unclear whether Houdini ever performed buried alive on stage</span>
				<span class='text'>The stunt was to be the feature escape of his 1927 season, but Houdini died on October 31, 1926</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;It is often erroneously reported that Houdini served as special-effects consultant on the Wharton/International cliffhanger serial, ''The Mysteries of Myra'', shot in Ithaca, New York, because Harry Grossman, director of ''The Master Mystery'' also filmed a serial in Ithaca at about the same time</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;While this was possibly the first flight in Australia, the first flight in the Southern Hemisphere was probably made by [[Richard Pearse]] in New Zealand several years earlier, either in 1903 or 1904</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Colin Defries was a trained pilot, having learnt to fly in Cannes, France</span>
				<span class='text'>By modern standards his flight time was minimal, but in 1909 he had accumulated enough to become an instructor</span>
				<span class='text'>On his first flight he took off, maintained straight and level flight, albeit briefly, and landed safely</span>
				<span class='text'>His crash landing on his second flight, when he tried to retrieve his hat which was blown off, demonstrated what a momentary lack of attention could cause while flying a [[Wright Model A]]</span>
