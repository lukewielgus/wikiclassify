				<span class='text'>He later regarded it as a flawed exposition of his logical system, and wanted ''[[The Laws of Thought|An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities]]'' to be seen as the mature statement of his views</span>
				<span class='text'>Contrary to widespread belief, Boole never intended to criticise or disagree with the main principles of Aristotle's logic</span>

				<span class='text'>===Boole's 1854 definition of [[universe of discourse]]====In every discourse, whether of the mind conversing with its own thoughts, or of the individual in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined</span>
				<span class='text'>The most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application, and for them the limits of discourse are co-extensive with those of the universe itself</span>
				<span class='text'>But more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field</span>
				<span class='text'>Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak, as of civilised men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men under some other condition or relation</span>
				<span class='text'>Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse</span>

				<span class='text'>oole replaced the operation of multiplication by the word 'and' and addition by the word 'or'</span>
				<span class='text'>But in Boole's original system, + was a [[partial operation]]: in the language of [[set theory]] it would correspond only to [[disjoint union]] of subsets</span>
				<span class='text'>Later authors changed the interpretation, commonly reading it as [[exclusive or]], or in set theory terms [[symmetric difference]]; this step means that addition is always defined</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Marc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{sep entry|algebra-logic-tradition|The Algebra of Logic Tradition|Stanley Burris}}&lt;/ref&gt;In fact there is the other possibility, that + should be read as [[disjunction]],&lt;ref name=KY/&gt; This other possibility extends from the disjoint union case, where exclusive or and non-exclusive or both give the same answer</span>
				<span class='text'>Handling this ambiguity was an early problem of the theory, reflecting the modern use of both [[Boolean ring]]s and Boolean algebras (which are simply different aspects of one type of structure)</span>
				<span class='text'>Boole and Jevons struggled over just this issue in 1863, in the form of the correct evaluation of ''x'' + ''x''</span>
				<span class='text'>Jevons argued for the result ''x'', which is correct for + as disjunction</span>
				<span class='text'>Boole kept the result as something undefined</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued against the result 0, which is correct for exclusive or, because he saw the equation ''x'' + ''x'' = 0 as implying ''x'' = 0, a false analogy with ordinary algebra</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Other significant figures were [[Platon Sergeevich Poretskii]], and [[William Ernest Johnson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The conception of a Boolean algebra structure on equivalent statements of a [[propositional calculus]] is credited to [[Hugh MacColl]] (1877), in work surveyed 15 years later by Johnson</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=GGB/&gt; Surveys of these developments were published by [[Ernst Schr√∂der]], [[Louis Couturat]], and [[Clarence Irving Lewis]]</span>

				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|In modern notation, the [[free Boolean algebra]] on basic propositions ''p'' and ''q'' arranged in a [[Hasse diagram]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Boolean combinations make up 16 different propositions, and the lines show which are logically related</span>
				<span class='text'>]In 1921 the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] published a book on probability theory, ''A Treatise of Probability''</span>
				<span class='text'>Keynes believed that Boole had made a fundamental error in his definition of independence which vitiated much of his analysis</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chapter XVI, p</span>
				<span class='text'>167, section 6 of ''A treatise on probability'', volume 4: &quot;The central error in his system of probability arises out of his giving two inconsistent definitions of 'independence' (2) He first wins the reader's acquiescence by giving a perfectly correct definition: &quot;Two events are said to be independent when the probability of either of them is unaffected by our ''expectation'' of the occurrence or failure of the other</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (3) But a moment later he interprets the term in quite a different sense; for, according to Boole's second definition, we must regard the events as independent unless we are told either that they ''must'' concur or that they ''cannot'' concur</span>
				<span class='text'>That is to say, they are independent unless we know for certain that there is, in fact, an invariable connection between them</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The simple events, ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', will be said to be ''conditioned'' when they are not free to occur in every possible combination; in other words, when some compound event depending upon them is precluded from occurring</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Simple unconditioned events are by definition independent</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (1) In fact as long as ''xz'' is ''possible'', ''x'' and ''z'' are independent</span>
				<span class='text'>This is plainly inconsistent with Boole's first definition, with which he makes no attempt to reconcile it</span>
				<span class='text'>The consequences of his employing the term independence in a double sense are far-reaching</span>
				<span class='text'>For he uses a method of reduction which is only valid when the arguments to which it is applied are independent in the first sense, and assumes that it is valid if they are independent in second sense</span>
				<span class='text'>While his theorems are true if all propositions or events involved are independent in the first sense, they are not true, as he supposes them to be, if the events are independent only in the second sense</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''The Last Challenge Problem'', David Miller provides a general method in accord with Boole's system and attempts to solve the problems recognised earlier by Keynes and others</span>
				<span class='text'>Theodore Hailperin showed much earlier that Boole had used the correct mathematical definition of independence in his worked out problems &lt;ref name=Miller&gt;[http://zeteticgleanings</span>

				<span class='text'>tml http://zeteticgleanings</span>
				<span class='text'>om/boole</span>
				<span class='text'>tml]&lt;/ref&gt;Boole's work and that of later logicians initially appeared to have no engineering uses</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Claude Shannon]] attended a philosophy class at the [[University of Michigan]] which introduced him to Boole's studies</span>
				<span class='text'>Shannon recognised that Boole's work could form the basis of mechanisms and processes in the real world and that it was therefore highly relevant</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1937 Shannon went on to write a master's thesis, at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], in which he showed how Boolean algebra could optimise the design of systems of electromechanical [[relay]]s then used in telephone routing switches</span>
				<span class='text'>He also proved that circuits with relays could solve Boolean algebra problems</span>
				<span class='text'>Employing the properties of electrical switches to process logic is the basic concept that underlies all modern electronic [[digital computer]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Victor Shestakov]] at Moscow State University (1907‚Äì1987) proposed a theory of electric switches based on Boolean logic even earlier than [[Claude Shannon]] in 1935 on the testimony of Soviet logicians and mathematicians [[Sofya Yanovskaya]], Gaaze-Rapoport, [[Roland Dobrushin]], Lupanov, Medvedev and Uspensky, though they presented their academic theses in the same year, 1938</span>
				<span class='text'>{Clarify|date=June 2009}} But the first publication of Shestakov's result took place only in 1941 (in Russian)</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence, Boolean algebra became the foundation of practical [[digital circuit]] design; and Boole, via Shannon and Shestakov, provided the theoretical grounding for the [[Information Age]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;That dissertation has since been hailed as one of the most significant master's theses of the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>To all intents and purposes, its use of binary code and Boolean algebra paved the way for the digital circuitry that is crucial to the operation of modern computers and telecommunications equipment</span>
