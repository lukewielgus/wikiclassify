				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Chronology /&gt;In 1834, at the age of six, Verne was sent to boarding school at 5 Place du Bouffay in Nantes</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jules-Verne|1976|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mme Sambin often told the students that her husband was a shipwrecked castaway and that he would eventually return like [[Robinson Crusoe]] from his desert island paradise</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allotte de la Fuÿe|1956|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of the [[Robinsonade]] would stay with Verne throughout his life and appear in many of his novels, including ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' (1874), ''[[Second Fatherland]]'' (1900), and ''[[The School for Robinsons]]'' (1882)</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1836, Verne went on to École Saint‑Stanislas, a Catholic school suiting the pious religious tastes of his father</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=LottmannSchools&gt;{{Harvnb|Lottmann|1996|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, 1836, Pierre Verne bought a [[vacation house]] at 29 Rue des Réformés in the village of Chantenay (now part of Nantes) on the [[Loire River]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn |Terres d'écrivains|2003}} In his brief memoir &quot;Souvenirs d’enfance et de jeunesse&quot; (&quot;Memories of Childhood and Youth&quot;, 1890), Verne recalled a deep fascination with the river and with the many [[merchant vessel]]s navigating it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Souvenirs2&gt;{{Harvnb|Verne|1890|loc=§2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also took vacations at [[Brains, Loire-Atlantique|Brains]], in the house of his uncle Prudent Allotte, a retired shipowner, who had gone around the world and served as mayor of Brains from 1828 to 1837</span>
				<span class='text'>Verne took joy in playing interminable rounds of the [[Game of the Goose]] with his uncle, and both the game and his uncle's name would be memorialized in two late novels (''[[The Will of an Eccentric]]'' (1900) and ''[[Robur the Conqueror]]'' (1886), respectively)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Souvenirs2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Compère|1997b|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;Legend has it that in 1839, at the age of 11, Verne secretly procured a spot as [[cabin boy]] on the three-mast ship ''Coralie'', with the intention of traveling to the Indies and bringing back a coral necklace for his cousin Caroline</span>
				<span class='text'>The ship was due to set out for the Indies that evening but stopped first at [[Paimboeuf]], where Pierre Verne arrived just in time to catch his son and make him promise to travel &quot;only in his imagination&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=LottmannSchools /&gt; From 1844 to 1846, Verne and his brother were enrolled in the Lycée Royal (now the Lycée Georges-Clemenceau in Nantes)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Compère|1997a|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;By 1847, when Verne was 19, he had taken seriously to writing long works in the style of [[Victor Hugo]], beginning ''Un prêtre en 1839'' and seeing two verse tragedies, ''Alexandre VI'' and ''La Conspiration des poudres'' (''The Gunpowder Plot''), to completion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Lottmann17 /&gt; However, his father took it for granted that Verne, being the firstborn son of the family, would not attempt to make money in literature but would instead inherit the family law practice</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lottmann|1996|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1847, Verne's father sent him to Paris, primarily to begin his studies in [[law school]], and secondarily (according to family legend) to distance him temporarily from Nantes</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verne's frustration was such that six years later, in a letter to his mother answering a request to visit the Dezaunays in Paris, he spoke sardonically of Caroline's new life and described her as &quot;a little less pregnant than usual&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;After a short stay in Paris, where he passed first-year law exams, Verne returned to Nantes for his father's help in preparing for the second year (provincial law students were in that era required to go to Paris to take exams)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Compère|1997c|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this time that he met Rose Herminie Arnaud Grossetière, a young woman one year his senior, and fell intensely in love with her</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martin|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;The sudden marriage sent Verne into deep frustration</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote a hallucinatory letter to his mother, apparently composed in a state of half-drunkenness, in which under pretext of a dream he described his misery (&quot;The bride was dressed in white, graceful symbol of the earnest soul of her fiancé; the bridegroom was dressed in black, mystical allusion to the color of the soul of his fiancée!&quot;)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chelebourg|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident also led Verne to bear a grudge against his birthplace and Nantes society, which he criticized in his poem &quot;La sixième ville de France&quot; (&quot;The Sixth City of France&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lottmann|1996|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Verne|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Studies in Paris===In July 1848, Verne left Nantes again for Paris, where his father intended him to finish law studies and take up law as a profession</span>

				<span class='text'>In June, barricades went up in Paris, and the government sent [[Louis-Eugène Cavaignac]] to crush the insurrection</span>
				<span class='text'>Verne entered the city shortly before the election of [[Napoléon III|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]] as the first president of the Republic, a state of affairs that would last until the [[French coup of 1851]], in which Bonaparte had himself crowned ruler of the [[Second French Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter to his family, Verne described the bombarded state of the city after the recent [[June Days Uprising]] but assured them that the anniversary of [[Bastille Day]] had gone by without any significant conflict</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jules-Verne|1976|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; While continuing his law studies, he fed his passion for the theatre, writing numerous plays</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lottmann|1996|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;During this period Verne's letters to his parents primarily focused on expenses and on a suddenly appearing series of violent [[abdominal pain|stomach cramps]],&lt;ref name=Lott25&gt;{{Harvnb|Lottmann|1996|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first of many he would suffer from during his life</span>

				<span class='text'>Verne, finding both a steady salary and a sure outlet for writing at last, accepted immediately</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jules-Verne|1976|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of his lifetime, most of his novels would be serialized in Hetzel's ''Magasin'' before their appearance in book form, beginning with his second novel for Hetzel, ''[[The Adventures of Captain Hatteras]]'' (1864–65)</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|A Hetzel edition of Verne's ''[[The Adventures of Captain Hatteras]]'' (cover style &quot;Aux deux éléphants&quot;)]]When ''The Adventures of Captain Hatteras'' was published in book form in 1866, Hetzel publicly announced his literary and educational ambitions for Verne's novels by saying in a preface that Verne's works would form a [[novel sequence]] called the ''[[Voyages Extraordinaires]]'' (''Extraordinary Voyages'' or ''Extraordinary Journeys''), and that Verne's aim was &quot;to outline all the geographical, geological, physical, and astronomical knowledge amassed by modern science and to recount, in an entertaining and picturesque format that is his own, the history of the universe</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|1988|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late in life, Verne confirmed that this commission had become the running theme of his novels: &quot;My object has been to depict the earth, and not the earth alone, but the universe… And I have tried at the same time to realize a very high ideal of beauty of style</span>
				<span class='text'>It is said that there can't be any style in a novel of adventure, but it isn't true</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherard4&quot; /&gt; However, he also noted that the project was extremely ambitious: &quot;Yes! But the Earth is very large, and life is very short! In order to leave a completed work behind, one would need to live to be at least 100 years old!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|1988|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;Hetzel influenced many of Verne's novels directly, especially in the first few years of their collaboration, for Verne was initially so happy to find a publisher that he agreed to almost all of the changes Hetzel suggested</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, when Hetzel disapproved of the original climax of ''Captain Hatteras'', including the death of the title character, Verne wrote an entirely new conclusion in which Hatteras survived</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2001|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hetzel also rejected Verne's next submission, ''[[Paris in the Twentieth Century]]'', believing its pessimistic view of the future and its condemnation of technological progress were too subversive for a family magazine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lottmann|1996|pp=101–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;The relationship between publisher and writer changed significantly around 1869, when Verne and Hetzel were brought into conflict over the manuscript for ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Verne had initially conceived of the submariner [[Captain Nemo]] as a Polish scientist whose acts of vengeance were directed against the Russians who had killed his family during the [[January Uprising]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hetzel, not wanting to alienate the lucrative Russian market for Verne's books, demanded that Nemo be made an enemy of the [[slave trade]], a situation that would make him an unambiguous hero</span>
				<span class='text'>Verne, after fighting vehemently against the change, finally invented a compromise in which Nemo's past is left mysterious</span>
				<span class='text'>After this disagreement, Verne became notably cooler in his dealings with Hetzel, taking suggestions into consideration but often rejecting them outright</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2000|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several notable contemporary figures, from the geographer Vivien de Saint-Martin to the critic [[Jules Claretie]], spoke highly of Verne and his works in critical and biographical notes</span>

				<span class='text'> As the novels and stage productions continued to sell, many contemporary critics felt that Verne's status as a commercially popular author meant he could only be seen as a mere genre-based storyteller, rather than a serious author worthy of academic study</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Evans14&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2000|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;This denial of formal literary status took various forms, including dismissive criticism by such writers as [[Émile Zola]] and the lack of nomination to Verne for membership in the [[Académie Française]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans14&quot; /&gt; and was far from unrecognized by Verne himself, who said in a late interview: &quot;The great regret of my life is that I have never taken any place in French literature</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2000|pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, sales of Verne's novels in their original unabridged versions dropped markedly even in Verne's home country, with abridged versions aimed directly at children taking their place</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2000|pp=24–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;In the 1960s and 1970s, thanks in large part to a sustained wave of serious literary study from well-known French scholars and writers, Verne's reputation skyrocketed in France</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Angenot|1976|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2000|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roland Barthes]]' seminal essay &quot;Nautilus et Bateau Ivre&quot; (&quot;The [[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]] and the [[Drunken Boat]]&quot;) was influential in its [[exegesis]] of the ''Voyages Extraordinares'' as a purely literary text, while book-length studies by such figures as Marcel Moré and Jean Chesneaux considered Verne from a multitude of thematic vantage points</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Angenot|1973|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;French literary journals devoted entire issues to Verne and his work, with essays by such imposing literary figures as [[Michel Butor]], [[Georges Borgeaud]], [[Marcel Brion]], [[Pierre Versins]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[René Barjavel]], [[Marcel Lecomte]], [[Francis Lacassin]], and [[Michel Serres]]; meanwhile, Verne's entire published opus returned to print, with unabridged and illustrated editions of his works printed by [[Livre de Poche]] and Éditions Rencontre</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2000|pp=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wave reached its climax in Verne's [[sesquicentennial]] year 1978, when he was made the subject of an academic colloquium at the [[Centre culturel international de Cerisy-la-Salle]], and ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' was accepted for the French university system's [[Agrégation]] reading list</span>
				<span class='text'>Since these events, Verne has been consistently recognized in Europe as a legitimate member of the French literary canon, with academic studies and new publications steadily continuing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2000|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;Verne's reputation in English-speaking countries has been considerably slower in changing</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the 20th century, most Anglophone scholars dismissed Verne as a genre writer for children and a naïve proponent of science and technology (despite strong evidence to the contrary on both counts), thus finding him more interesting as a technological &quot;prophet&quot; or as a subject of comparison to English-language writers such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[H</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>Wells]] than as a topic of literary study in his own right</span>
				<span class='text'>This narrow view of Verne has undoubtedly been influenced by the poor-quality [[Jules Verne#English translations|English translations]] and very loosely adapted [[Hollywood]] film versions through which most American and British readers have discovered Verne</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Evans33&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2000|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Butcher Prophet&quot;/&gt; However, since the mid-1980s a considerable number of serious English-language studies and translations have appeared, suggesting that a rehabilitation of Verne's Anglophone reputation may currently be underway</span>

				<span class='text'>Wilbur</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2005b|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translation of his novels began in 1869 with William Lackland's translation of ''[[Five Weeks in a Balloon]]'' (originally published in 1863),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2005b|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued steadily throughout Verne's lifetime, with publishers and hired translators often working in great haste to rush his most lucrative titles into English-language print</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Evans2005a80&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2005a|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Hetzel, who targeted all ages with his publishing strategies for the ''Voyages Extraordinaires'', the British and American publishers of Verne chose to market his books almost exclusively to young audiences; this business move, with its implication that Verne could be treated purely as a children's author, had a long-lasting effect on Verne's reputation in English-speaking countries</span>

				<span class='text'>df|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British writer [[Adam Roberts (British writer)|Adam Roberts]], in an essay for ''[[The Guardian]]'' titled &quot;Jules Verne deserves a better translation service&quot;, commented: &quot;I'd always liked reading Jules Verne and I've read most of his novels; but it wasn't until recently that I really understood I hadn't been reading Jules Verne at all</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> It's a bizarre situation for a world-famous writer to be in</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, I can't think of a major writer who has been so poorly served by translation</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Roberts /&gt;Similarly, the American novelist [[Michael Crichton]] observed:{{bq|Verne's prose is lean and fast-moving in a peculiarly modern way … [but] Verne has been particularly ill-served by his English translators</span>
				<span class='text'>At best they have provided us with clunky, choppy, tone-deaf prose</span>
				<span class='text'>At worst—as in the notorious 1872 &quot;translation&quot; [of ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]''] published by Griffith &amp; Farran—they have blithely altered the text, giving Verne's characters new names, and adding whole pages of their own invention, thus effectively obliterating the meaning and tone of Verne's original</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Crichton /&gt;}}Since 1965, a considerable number of more accurate English translations of Verne have appeared</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the highly criticized older translations continue to be republished, due to their [[public domain]] status and in many cases their easy availability in online sources</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Miller2009 /&gt;===Relationship with science fiction===The relationship between Verne's ''Voyages Extraordinaires'' and the literary genre [[science fiction]] is a complex one</span>
				<span class='text'>Verne, like [[H</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>Wells]], is frequently cited as one of the founders of the genre, and his profound influence on its development is indisputable; however, many earlier writers, such as [[Lucian of Samosata]] and [[Mary Shelley]], have also been cited as creators of science fiction, an unavoidable ambiguity arising from the vague definition and [[History of science fiction|history of the genre]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts48&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Roberts|first=Adam|title=Science Fiction|publisher=Routledge|publication-place=London|year=2000|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;A primary issue at the heart of the dispute is the question of whether Verne's works count as science fiction to begin with</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Maurice Renard]] claimed that Verne &quot;never wrote a single sentence of scientific-marvelous&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>epauw</span>
				<span class='text'>du/sfs/documents/renard</span>
				<span class='text'>tm Maurice Renard- On the Scientific-Marvellous Novel and Its Influence on the Understanding of Progress]&lt;/ref&gt; Verne himself argued repeatedly in interviews that his novels were not meant to be read as scientific, saying &quot;I do not in any way pose as a scientist&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Belloc&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Belloc|1895}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;I have invented nothing</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sherard|1903|loc=§5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His own goal was rather to &quot;depict the earth [and] at the same time to realize a very high ideal of beauty of style&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherard4&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Sherard|1894|loc=§4}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he pointed out in an example:{{bq|I wrote ''[[Five Weeks in a Balloon]],'' not as a story about ballooning, but as a story about Africa</span>
				<span class='text'>I always was greatly interested in geography and travel, and I wanted to give a romantic description of Africa</span>
				<span class='text'>Now, there was no means of taking my travellers through Africa otherwise than in a balloon, and that is why a balloon is introduced</span>
				<span class='text'> I may say that at the time I wrote the novel, as now, I had no faith in the possibility of ever steering balloons…&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherard4&quot; /&gt;}}Closely related to Verne's science-fiction reputation is the often-repeated claim that he is a &quot;[[prophet]]&quot; of scientific progress, and that many of his novels involve elements of technology that were fantastic for his day but later became commonplace</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|1988|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims have a long history, especially in America, but the modern scholarly consensus is that such claims of prophecy are heavily exaggerated</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|1988|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with science fiction, Verne himself flatly denied that he was a futuristic prophet, saying that any connection between scientific developments and his work were &quot;mere coincidence&quot; and attributing his indisputable scientific accuracy to his extensive research: &quot;even before I began writing stories, I always took numerous notes out of every book, newspaper, magazine, or scientific report that I came across</span>
