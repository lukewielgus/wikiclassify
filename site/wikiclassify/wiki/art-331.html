				<span class='text'>The panel was composed of individuals experienced in conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peacebuilding, and became known as the &quot;Brahimi Report&quot;, after [[Lakhdar Brahimi]], Chair of the Panel</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Report of the Panel on United Nations Peacekeeping|report issued by the panel]] called for:# renewed political commitment on the part of Member States;# significant institutional change;# increased financial support</span>
				<span class='text'>he Panel further noted that in order to be effective, UN peacekeeping operations must be properly resourced and equipped, and operate under clear, credible and achievable mandates</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter transmitting the report to the General Assembly and Security Council, Annan stated that the Panel’s recommendations were &quot;essential to make the United Nations truly credible as a force for peace</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Later that same year,  the United Nations Security Council adopted several provisions relating to peacekeeping following the report, in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1327|Resolution 1327]]</span>

				<span class='text'>df We the peoples: the role of the United Nations in the 21st century]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> The report argued that the significant geopolitical evolutions and increased globalization experienced over the previous 50 years required the United Nations to reassess and transform the way it operates</span>
				<span class='text'>The report called for member states to &quot;put people at the centre of everything we do</span>
				<span class='text'>No calling is more noble, and no responsibility greater, than that of enabling men, women and children, in cities and villages around the world, to make their lives better</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;In the final chapter of the report, Annan drew on the findings of earlier work by the UN, The World Bank, the IMF and OECD, and identified priority areas on which the UN should focus in order to &quot;free our fellow men and women from the abject and dehumanizing poverty in which more than 1 billion of them are currently confined&quot;  These served as the basis for the subsequent Millennium Development Goals, which were developed with additional input from the Millennium Forum, a group comprised 1,000 non-governmental and civil society organizations from more than 100 countries </span>
				<span class='text'>t the end of the Millennium Summit, delegates adopted the [[United Nations Millennium Declaration|Millennium Declaration]], in which they committed to a new global partnership to reduce extreme poverty and set out a series of time-bound targets which subsequently become known as the Millennium Development Goals</span>
				<span class='text'>===The United Nations Global Compact====In an address to The World Economic Forum on 31 January 1999, then Secretary General Annan argued that the &quot;goals of the United Nations and those of business can, indeed, be mutually supportive&quot; and proposed that the private sector and the United Nations initiate &quot;a global compact of shared values and principles, which will give a human face to the global market</span>

				<span class='text'>===Establishment of The Global Fund====Towards the end of the 1990s, increased awareness of the destructive potential of epidemics such as HIV/AIDS pushed public health issues to the top of the global development agenda</span>
				<span class='text'> In April 2001, Annan issued a five-point &quot;Call to Action&quot; to address the HIV/AIDS [[pandemic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Stating it was a &quot;personal priority&quot;, Annan proposed the establishment of a [[Global AIDS and Health Fund]], &quot;dedicated to the battle against HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>In June of that year, the General Assembly of the United Nations committed to the creation of such a fund during a special session on AIDS, and the permanent secretariat of the Global Fund was subsequently established in June 2002</span>
				<span class='text'>===Responsibility to Protect====Following the failure of Annan and the International Community to intervene in the genocide in Rwanda and in Srebrenica, Annan asked whether the international community had an obligation in such situations to intervene to protect civilian populations</span>

				<span class='text'>rg]&lt;/ref&gt; Annan argued that individual sovereignty- the protections afforded by the Declaration of Human Rights and the Charter of the UN, were being strengthened, while the notion of state sovereignty was being redefined by globalization and international cooperation</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, the UN and its Member States had to re-consider their willingness to act to prevent conflict and civilian suffering</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=November 2014}}In September 2001 the Canadian government established an ad-hoc committee to address this balance between State sovereignty and humanitarian intervention</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty]] published its final report in 2001, which focused not on the right of states to intervene but on a responsibility to protect populations at risk</span>
				<span class='text'>The report moved beyond the question of military intervention, arguing that a range of diplomatic and humanitarian actions could also be utilized to protect civilian populations</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=November 2014}}In 2005, Annan included the doctrine of ‘[[Responsibility to Protect]]’ in his report '[http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>He later believed that Annan was oblivious to the fact the Iraqis took advantage of this in order to delay inspections</span>
				<span class='text'>He claimed that on one occasion, Annan refused to implement a no-notice inspection of the [[Iraqi Special Security Organization|SSO]] headquarters and instead tried to negotiate access, but the negotiation ended up taking nearly six weeks, giving the Iraqis more than enough time to clean out the site</span>
