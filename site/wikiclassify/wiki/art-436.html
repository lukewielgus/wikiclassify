				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|A page from the 1470 Ulrich Han printing of Plutarch's ''[[Parallel Lives]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>]{{Main|Parallel Lives}}Plutarch's best-known work is the ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', a series of [[biography|biographies]] of famous Greeks and Romans, arranged in pairs to illuminate their common [[morality|moral]] virtues and vices</span>
				<span class='text'>The surviving ''Lives'' contain 23 pairs, each with one Greek ''Life'' and one Roman ''Life'', as well as four unpaired single ''Lives''</span>
				<span class='text'>s is explained in the opening paragraph of his ''Life of Alexander'', Plutarch was not concerned with history so much as the influence of character, good or bad, on the lives and destinies of men</span>
				<span class='text'>Whereas sometimes he barely touched on epoch-making events, he devoted much space to charming anecdote and incidental triviality, reasoning that this often said far more for his subjects than even their most famous accomplishments</span>
				<span class='text'>He sought to provide rounded portraits, likening his craft to that of a painter; indeed, he went to tremendous lengths (often leading to tenuous comparisons) to draw [[Physiognomy|parallels between physical appearance]] and [[moral character]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In many ways, he must be counted amongst the earliest [[ethics|moral philosophers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ome of the ''Lives'', such as those of [[Heracles]], [[Philip II of Macedon]] and [[Scipio Africanus]], no longer exist; many of the remaining ''Lives'' are truncated, contain obvious [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] or have been tampered with by later writers</span>
				<span class='text'>Extant ''Lives'' include those on [[Solon]], [[Themistocles]], [[Aristides]], [[Agesilaus II]], [[Pericles]], [[Alcibiades]], [[Nicias]], [[Demosthenes]], [[Pelopidas]], [[Philopoemen]], [[Timoleon]], [[Dion of Syracuse]], [[Eumenes]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]], [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]], [[Numa Pompilius]], [[Coriolanus]], [[Theseus]], [[Aemilius Paullus]], [[Tiberius Gracchus]], [[Gaius Gracchus]], [[Gaius Marius]], [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]], [[Sertorius]], [[Lucullus]], [[Pompey]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Cicero]], [[Cato the Younger]], [[Mark Antony]], and [[Marcus Junius Brutus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Spartan lives and sayings===Since Spartans wrote no history prior to the Hellenistic period, and since their only extant literature is fragments of seventh-century lyrics, Plutarch's five Spartan lives and ''Sayings of Spartans'' and ''Sayings of Spartan Women'', rooted in sources that have since disappeared, are one of the richest sources for historians of Lacedaemonia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pomeroy, Sarah B</span>
				<span class='text'>1999&quot;&gt;Pomeroy, Sarah B</span>
				<span class='text'> Stanley M</span>

				<span class='text'>Ancient Greece: A Political, Social, and Cultural History</span>
				<span class='text'>New York, New York: Oxford University Press, 1999</span>
				<span class='text'>Print</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  But while they're important, they're also controversial</span>
				<span class='text'> Plutarch lived centuries after the Sparta he writes about (and a full millennium separates him from the earliest events he records) and even though he visited Sparta, many of the ancient customs he reports had been long abandoned, meaning he never actually saw with his eyes what he detailed with his pen</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pomeroy, Sarah B</span>
				<span class='text'>1999&quot;/&gt;  Plutarch's sources themselves can be problematic</span>
				<span class='text'> As the historians Sarah Pomeroy, Stanley Burstein, Walter Donlan, and Jenniefer Tolbert Roberts have written, &quot;Plutarch was influenced by histories written after the decline of Sparta and marked by nostalgia for a happier past, real or imagined</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pomeroy, Sarah B</span>
				<span class='text'>1999&quot;/&gt;  Turning to Plutarch himself, they write, &quot;the admiration writers like Plutarch and Xenophon felt for Spartan society led them to exaggerate its monolithic nature, minimizing departures from ideals of equality and obscuring patterns of historical change</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pomeroy, Sarah B</span>
				<span class='text'>1999&quot;/&gt;  Thus the Spartan egalitarianism and superhuman immunity to pain that have seized the popular imagination are likely myths, and their main architect is Plutarch</span>
				<span class='text'> While flawed, Plutarch is nonetheless indispensable as one of the only ancient sources of information on Spartan life</span>
				<span class='text'> Pomeroy et al</span>
				<span class='text'>conclude that Plutarch's works on Sparta, while they must be treated with skepticism, remain valuable for their &quot;large quantities of information&quot; and these historians concede that &quot;Plutarch's writings on Sparta, more than those of any other ancient author, have shaped later views of Sparta,&quot; despite their potential to misinform</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pomeroy, Sarah B</span>
				<span class='text'>1999&quot;/&gt;===''Life of Alexander''===Plutarch's ''Life of Alexander'', written as a parallel to that of Julius Caesar, is one of only five extant tertiary sources on the Macedonian conqueror [[Alexander the Great]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It includes [[anecdote]]s and descriptions of events that appear in no other source, just as Plutarch's portrait of [[Numa Pompilius]], the putative second king of Rome, holds much that is unique on the early [[Roman calendar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lutarch devotes a great deal of space to Alexander's drive and desire, and strives to determine how much of it was presaged in his youth</span>
				<span class='text'>He also draws extensively on the work of [[Lysippus]], Alexander's favourite [[sculptor]], to provide what is probably the fullest and most accurate description of the conqueror's physical appearance</span>
				<span class='text'>hen it comes to his character, however, Plutarch is often rather less accurate, ascribing inordinate amounts of self-control to a man who very often lost it</span>
				<span class='text'>{efn|The murder of [[Cleitus the Black]], which Alexander instantly and deeply regretted, is commonly cited to this end</span>
				<span class='text'>} It is significant, though, that the subject incurs less admiration from his biographer as the narrative progresses and the deeds that it recounts become less savoury</span>
				<span class='text'>uch, too, is made of Alexander's scorn for luxury: &quot;He desired not pleasure or wealth, but only excellence and glory</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This is mostly true, for Alexander's tastes grew more extravagant as he grew older only in the last year of his life and only{{according to whom|date=August 2014}} as a means of approaching the image of a ruler his Persian subjects were better accustomed to ‚Äî thus making it easier for him to succeed in uniting the Greek and Persian worlds together, according to the plan he had announced in his famous Speech given in Opis in 324 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Life of Caesar''===Together with [[Suetonius]]'s ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'' this ''Life'' is the main account of [[Julius Caesar]]'s feats by ancient historians</span>
				<span class='text'>Plutarch starts by telling us the audacity of Caesar and his refusal to dismiss [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna|Cinna's]] daughter, [[Cornelia Cinna minor|Cornelia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Other important parts are these containing his military deeds, accounts of battles and Caesar's capacity of inspiring the soldiers</span>
				<span class='text'>{quotation|His soldiers showed such good will and zeal in his service that those who in their previous campaigns had been in no way superior to others were invincible and irresistible in confronting every danger to enhance Caesar's fame</span>
				<span class='text'>Such a man, for instance, was Acilius, who, in the sea-fight at Massalia, boarded a hostile ship and had his right hand cut off with a sword, but clung with the other hand to his shield, and dashing it into the faces of his foes, routed them all and got possession of the vessel</span>
				<span class='text'>Such a man, again, was Cassius Scaeva, who, in the battle at Dyrrhachium, had his eye struck out with an arrow, his shoulder transfixed with one javelin and his thigh with another, and received on his shield the blows of one hundred and thirty missiles</span>
				<span class='text'>In this plight, he called the enemy to him as though he would surrender</span>
				<span class='text'>Two of them, accordingly, coming up, he lopped off the shoulder of one with his sword, smote the other in the face and put him to flight, and came off safely himself with the aid of his comrades</span>
				<span class='text'>Again, in Britain, when the enemy had fallen upon the foremost centurions, who had plunged into a watery marsh, a soldier, while Caesar in person was watching the battle, dashed into the midst of the fight, displayed many conspicuous deeds of daring, and rescued the centurions, after the Barbarians had been routed</span>
				<span class='text'>Then he himself, making his way with difficulty after all the rest, plunged into the muddy current, and at last, without his shield, partly swimming and partly wading, got across</span>
				<span class='text'>Caesar and his company were amazed and came to meet the soldier with cries of joy; but he, in great dejection, and with a burst of tears, cast himself at Caesar's feet, begging pardon for the loss of his shield</span>
				<span class='text'>Again, in Africa, Scipio captured a ship of Caesar's in which Granius Petro, who had been appointed quaestor, was sailing</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the rest of the passengers Scipio made booty, but told the quaestor that he offered him his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Granius, however, remarking that it was the custom with Caesar's soldiers not to receive but to offer mercy, killed himself with a blow of his sword</span>
				<span class='text'>''Life of Caesar'', XVI}}However, this ''Life'' shows few differences between Suetonius' work and Caesar's own works (see ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'' and ''[[De Bello Civili]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Sometimes, Plutarch quotes directly from the ''De Bello Gallico'' and even tells us of the moments when Caesar was dictating his works</span>
