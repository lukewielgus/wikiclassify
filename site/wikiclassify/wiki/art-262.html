				<span class='text'>In the Orthodox Church his feast day is 23 August</span>
				<span class='text'>=Biography==Irenaeus was born during the first half of the 2nd century (the exact date is disputed: between the years 115 and 125 according to some, or 130 and 142 according to others), and he is thought to have been a [[Greek people|Greek]] from [[Polycarp]]'s hometown of [[Smyrna]] in [[Asia Minor]], now [[ƒ∞zmir]], [[Turkey]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus himself tells us (''Against Heresies'' 3</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>, cf Eusebius ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 5</span>
				<span class='text'>0</span>
				<span class='text'>ff) that in his 'youth' he saw Polycarp, the Bishop of Smyrna who was martyred c156</span>
				<span class='text'>This is the evidence used to assume that Irenaeus was born in Smyrna during the 130s‚Äì140s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many of his contemporaries, he was brought up in a Christian family rather than converting as an adult</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the persecution of [[Marcus Aurelius]], the Roman Emperor from 161‚Äì180, Irenaeus was a priest of the Church of Lyon</span>
				<span class='text'>The clergy of that city, many of whom were suffering imprisonment for the faith, sent him in 177 to Rome with a letter to [[Pope Eleuterus]] concerning the heresy [[Montanism]], and that occasion bore emphatic testimony to his merits</span>
				<span class='text'>While Irenaeus was in Rome, a massacre took place in Lyon</span>
				<span class='text'>Returning to Gaul, Irenaeus succeeded the martyr [[Saint Pothinus]] and became the second Bishop of Lyon</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 5</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;During the religious peace which followed the persecution of Marcus Aurelius, the new bishop divided his activities between the duties of a pastor and of a missionary (as to which we have but brief data, late and not very certain)</span>
				<span class='text'>Almost all his writings were directed against Gnosticism</span>
				<span class='text'>The most famous of these writings is ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'' (''Against Heresies'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Irenaeus alludes to coming across Gnostic writings, and holding conversations with Gnostics, and this may have taken place in Asia Minor or in Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', 1</span>
				<span class='text'>r</span>
				<span class='text'>, 4</span>
				<span class='text'>r</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; However, it also appears that Gnosticism was present near Lyon: he writes that there were followers of '[[Simon Magus|Magus the Magician]]' living and teaching in the [[Rhone valley]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Against Heresies 1</span>
				<span class='text'>3</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;Little is known about the career of Irenaeus after he became bishop</span>
				<span class='text'>The last action reported of him (by [[Eusebius]], 150 years later) is that in 190 or 191, he exerted influence on [[Pope Victor I]] not to excommunicate the Christian communities of Asia Minor which persevered in the practice of the [[Quartodeciman]] celebration of [[Easter]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 5</span>
				<span class='text'>4</span>
				<span class='text'>ff&lt;/ref&gt;Nothing is known of the date of his death, which must have occurred at the end of the 2nd or the beginning of the 3rd century</span>
				<span class='text'>A few within the Roman Catholic Church and Orthodox Church celebrate him as a martyr</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory of Tours]] is the first to mention a tradition which held Irenaeus to be a martyr&lt;/ref&gt;  He was buried under the Church of Saint John in Lyon, which was later renamed St Irenaeus in his honour</span>
				<span class='text'>The tomb and his remains were utterly destroyed in 1562 by the [[Huguenots]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Writings==Irenaeus wrote a number of books, but the most important that survives is the ''Against Heresies'' (or, in its [[Latin language|Latin]] title, ''Adversus Haereses'')</span>
				<span class='text'>In Book I, Irenaeus talks about the Valentinian Gnostics and their predecessors, who go as far back as the magician [[Simon Magus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Book II he attempts to provide proof that [[Valentinianism]] contains no merit in terms of its doctrines</span>
				<span class='text'>In Book III Irenaeus purports to show that these doctrines are false, by providing counter-evidence gleaned from the [[Gospel]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Book IV consists of Jesus' sayings, and here Irenaeus also stresses the unity of the Old Testament and the Gospel</span>
				<span class='text'>In the final volume, Book V, Irenaeus focuses on more sayings of Jesus plus the letters of [[Paul the Apostle]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The purpose of &quot;Against Heresies&quot; was to refute the teachings of various Gnostic groups; apparently, several Greek merchants had begun an oratorial campaign in Irenaeus' bishopric, teaching that the material world was the accidental creation of an evil god, from which we are to escape by the pursuit of ''gnosis''</span>
				<span class='text'>Irenaeus argued that the true gnosis is in fact knowledge of Christ, which redeems rather than escapes from bodily existence</span>
				<span class='text'>Until the discovery of the [[Nag Hammadi library|Library of Nag Hammadi]] in 1945, ''Against Heresies'' was the best-surviving description of Gnosticism</span>
				<span class='text'>According to some biblical scholars, the findings at Nag Hammadi have shown Irenaeus' description of Gnosticism to be largely inaccurate and polemic in nature</span>

				<span class='text'>104</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Though correct in some details about the belief systems of various groups, Irenaeus' main purpose was to warn Christians against Gnosticism, rather than catalog those beliefs</span>
				<span class='text'>He described Gnostic groups as sexual libertines, for example, when some of their own writings advocated chastity more strongly than did orthodox texts‚Äîyet the gnostic texts cannot be taken as guides to their actual practices, about which almost nothing is reliably known today</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, at least one scholar, [[Rodney Stark]], claims that it is the same Nag Hammadi library that proves Irenaeus right</span>

				<span class='text'>''Discovering God'' (New York: HarperCollins, 2007), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>325‚Äì327</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;It seemed that Irenaeus's critiques against the gnostics were exaggerated, which led to his scholarly dismissal for a long time</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|reason=This claim is not borne out by the following sentences</span>
				<span class='text'>date=June 2014}} For example, he wrote: &quot;They declare that Judas the traitor was thoroughly acquainted with these things, and that he alone, knowing the truth as no other did, accomplished the mystery of betrayal; by him all things were thus thrown into confusion</span>
				<span class='text'>They produce a fictitious history of this kind, which they style the Gospel of Judas</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ireneaus</span>
				<span class='text'>''Against Heresies'', I:31</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; These claims turned out to be truly mentioned in the [[Gospel of Judas]] where Jesus asked Judas to betray him</span>
				<span class='text'>In any case the gnostics were not a single group, but a wide array of [[sects]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Some groups were indeed libertine because they considered bodily existence meaningless; others praise chastity, and strongly prohibited any sexual activity, even within marriage</span>

				<span class='text'>6&lt;/ref&gt;Irenaeus also wrote ''The Demonstration of the Apostolic Preaching'' (also known as ''Proof of the Apostolic Preaching''), an [[Armenian language|Armenian]] copy of which was discovered in 1904</span>

				<span class='text'>Sara Parvis and Paul Foster (Minneanpolis: Fortress Press, 2012), 20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Before Irenaeus, Christians differed as to which gospel they preferred</span>
				<span class='text'>The Christians of Asia Minor preferred the Gospel of John</span>
				<span class='text'>The Gospel of Matthew was the most popular overall</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name =&quot;Harris&quot;&gt;[[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L</span>
				<span class='text'>],'' Understanding the Bible'' (Palo Alto: Mayfield, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Irenaeus asserted that four Gospels, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], and [[Gospel of John|John]], were canonical scripture</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;But it is not possible that the Gospels can be either more or fewer in number than they are</span>
				<span class='text'>For since there are four zones of the world in which we live, and four principal winds, while the church has been scattered throughout the world, and since the 'pillar and ground' of the Church is the Gospel and the spirit of life, it is fitting that she should have four pillars, breathing incorruption on every side, and vivifying human afresh</span>
				<span class='text'>From this fact, it is evident that the Logos, the fashioner ''[[demiurge|demiourgos]]'' of all, he that sits on the cherubim and holds all things together, when he was manifested to humanity, gave us the gospel under four forms but bound together by one spirit</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Against Heresies 3</span>
				<span class='text'>1</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Irenaeus provides the earliest witness to the assertion of the four canonical Gospels, possibly in reaction to [[Marcion]]'s edited version of the Gospel of Luke, which Marcion asserted was the one and only true gospel</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;amazon</span>
				<span class='text'>om&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;Based on the arguments Irenaeus made in support of only four authentic gospels, some interpreters deduce that the ''fourfold Gospel'' must have still been a novelty in Irenaeus' time</span>

				<span class='text'>tml Irenaeus &amp; the Pristine Faith Rule] }}==Irenaeus' theology and contrast with Gnosticism==The central point of Irenaeus' [[theology]] is the unity and the goodness of [[God]], in opposition to the Gnostics' theory of God; a number of divine emanations [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|(Aeons)]] along with a distinction between the [[Monad (Gnosticism)|Monad]] and the [[Demiurge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Irenaeus uses the [[Logos]] theology he inherited from [[Justin Martyr]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Irenaeus was a student of [[Polycarp]], who was said to have been tutored by [[John the Apostle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=p368 /&gt; (John had used Logos terminology in the [[Gospel of John]] and the letter of [[1 John]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Irenaeus prefers to speak of the Son and the Spirit as the &quot;hands of God&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>== The Unity of Salvation History ===Irenaeus' emphasis on the unity of God is reflected in his corresponding emphasis on the unity of [[salvation]] history</span>
				<span class='text'>Irenaeus repeatedly insists that God began the world and has been overseeing it ever since this creative act; everything that has happened is part of his plan for humanity</span>
				<span class='text'>The essence of this plan is a process of maturation: Irenaeus believes that humanity was created immature, and God intended his creatures to take a long time to grow into or assume the divine likeness</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, [[Adam and Eve]] were created as children</span>
				<span class='text'>Their [[fall (religion)|Fall]] was thus not a full-blown rebellion but rather a childish spat, a desire to grow up before their time and have everything with immediacy</span>
				<span class='text'>verything that has happened since has therefore been planned by God to help humanity overcome this initial mishap and achieve spiritual maturity</span>
				<span class='text'>The world has been intentionally designed by God as a difficult place, where human beings are forced to make moral decisions, as only in this way can they mature as moral agents</span>
				<span class='text'>Irenaeus likens death to the big fish that swallowed [[Jonah]]: it was only in the depths of the whale's belly that Jonah could turn to God and act according to the divine will</span>
				<span class='text'>Similarly, death and suffering appear as [[evil]]s, but without them we could never come to know God</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Irenaeus, the high point in salvation history is the advent of [[Jesus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For Irenaeus, the Incarnation of [[Christ]] was intended by God before He determined that humanity would be created</span>
				<span class='text'> Irenaeus develops this idea based on [https://www</span>
				<span class='text'>iblegateway</span>
				<span class='text'>om/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A14&amp;version=NRSVCE Rom</span>
				<span class='text'>5:14], saying &quot;Forinasmuch as He had a pre-existence as a saving Being, it was necessary that what might be saved should also be called into existence, in order that the Being who saves should not exist in vain</span>

				<span class='text'>2</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Irenaeus sees Christ as the new Adam, who systematically ''undoes'' what Adam did: thus, where Adam was disobedient concerning God's edict concerning the fruit of the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]], Christ was obedient even to death on the wood of a tree</span>
				<span class='text'>Irenaeus is the first to draw comparisons between [[Eve]] and [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]], contrasting the faithlessness of the former with the faithfulness of the latter</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to reversing the wrongs done by Adam, Irenaeus thinks of Christ as &quot;recapitulating&quot; or &quot;summing up&quot; human life</span>

				<span class='text'>He characterizes the penalty for sin as death and [[corruption (philosophical concept)|corruption]]</span>
				<span class='text'>God, however, is [[Immortality|immortal]] and incorruptible, and simply by becoming united to human nature in Christ he conveys those qualities to us: they spread, as it were, like a benign infection</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Irenaeus emphasizes that salvation occurs through Christ's His Incarnation, which bestows incorruptibility on humanity, rather than emphasizing His Redemptive death in the [[crucifixion]], although the latter event is an integral part of the former</span>

				<span class='text'>47, 57</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==== Christ's Life ====Part of the process of recapitulation is for Christ to go through every stage of human life, from infancy to old age, and simply by living it, sanctify it with his divinity</span>
				<span class='text'>Although it is sometimes claimed that Irenaeus believed Christ did not die until he was older than is conventionally portrayed, the bishop of Lyons simply pointed out that because Jesus turned the permissible age for becoming a rabbi (30 years old and above), he recapitulated and sanctified the period between 30 and 50 years old, as per the Jewish custom of periodization of human life, and so touches the beginning of old age when one becomes 50 years old</span>
				<span class='text'>(see [[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis#Main arguments|Adversus Haereses, book II, chapter 22]])</span>
				<span class='text'>n the passage of ''Adversus Haereses'' under consideration, Irenaeus is clear that after receiving baptism at the age of thirty, citing Luke 3:23, Gnostics then falsely assert that &quot;He [Jesus] preached only one year reckoning from His baptism,&quot; and also, &quot;On completing His thirtieth year He [Jesus] suffered, being in fact still a young man, and who had by no means attained to advanced age</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Irenaeus argues against the Gnostics by using scripture to show that Jesus lives at least several years after his baptism by referencing 3 distinctly separate visits to Jerusalem</span>
				<span class='text'> The first is when Jesus makes wine out of water, He goes up to the Paschal feast-day, after which He withdraws and is found in Samaria</span>
				<span class='text'>The second is when Jesus goes up to Jerusalem for Passover and cures the paralytic, after which He withdraws over the sea of Tiberias</span>
				<span class='text'>The third mention is when He travels to Jerusalem, eats the Passover, and suffers on the following day</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;Irenaeus quotes scripture, which we reference as John 8:57, to suggest that Jesus ministers while in his 40's</span>
				<span class='text'>In this passage, Jesus' opponents want to argue that Jesus has not seen Abraham, because Jesus is too young</span>
				<span class='text'>Jesus' opponents argue that Jesus is not yet 50 years old</span>
				<span class='text'>Irenaeus argues that if Jesus was in his thirties, his opponents would've argued that He's not yet 40 years, since that would make Him even younger</span>
				<span class='text'> Irenaeus' argument is that they would not weaken their own argument by adding years to Jesus' age</span>
				<span class='text'>Irenaeus also writes that &quot;The Elders witness to this, who in Asia conferred with John the Lord's disciple, to the effect that John had delivered these things unto them: for he abode with them until the times of Trajan</span>
				<span class='text'> And some of them saw not only John, but others also of the Apostles, and had this same account from them, and witness to the aforesaid relation</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;/&gt;In Demonstration (74) Irenaeus reinforced his view that Jesus was at least 45 with the statement &quot;For [[Agrippa I|Herod the king of the Jews]] and Pontius Pilate, the governor of [[Claudius|Claudius Caesar]], came together and condemned Him to be crucified</span>

				<span class='text'>econciliation is also a theme of Paul‚Äôs that Irenaeus stresses in his teachings on Salvation</span>
				<span class='text'>Irenaeus believes Jesus coming in flesh and blood sanctified humanity so that it might again reflect the perfection associated with the likeness of the Divine</span>
				<span class='text'>This perfection leads to a new life, in the lineage of God, which is forever striving for eternal life and unity with the Father</span>

				<span class='text'>9</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; This is a carryover from Paul, who attributes this reconciliation to the actions of Christ: ‚ÄúFor since death came through a human being, the resurrection of the dead has also come through a human being; for as all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ‚Äù [https://www</span>

				<span class='text'>It is in this obedient sacrifice that Jesus is victor and reconciler, thus erasing the marks that Adam left on human nature</span>
				<span class='text'>To argue against the Gnostics on this point, Irenaeus uses Colossians [https://www</span>

				<span class='text'>However, the end times does not happen immediately and Christians begin to worry and have doubts about the faith</span>
				<span class='text'>For Irenaeus, sin is seen as haste, just as Adam and Eve quickly ate from the tree of knowledge as they pleased</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, redemption restored to humanity through the Christ's submission to God‚Äôs will</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, the salvation of man will also be restored to the original trajectory controlled by God forfeited in humanity's sinful in haste</span>

				<span class='text'>=== Christ as the New Adam ====To counter his Gnostic opponents, Irenaeus significantly develops Paul's presentation of Christ as the [[Last Adam]]</span>

				<span class='text'> Irenaeus uses this parallel to demonstrate that Christ truly took human flesh</span>
				<span class='text'> Irenaeus consideres it important to emphasize this point because he understands the failure to recognize Christ's full humanity the bond linking the various strains of Gnosticism together, as seen in his statement that &quot;according to the opinion of no one of the heretics was the Word of God made flesh</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;For Irenaeus, Paul's presentation of the Old Law (the [[Mosaic covenant]]) in this passage indicates that the Old Law revealed humanity's sinfulness but could not save them</span>
				<span class='text'> He explains that &quot;For as the law was spiritual, it merely made sin to stand out in relief, but did not destroy it</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Irenaeus' interpretation of Paul's discussion of Christ as the New Adam is significant because it helped develop the [[Recapitulation theory of atonement]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Irenaeus emphasizes that it is through Christ's reversal of Adam's action that humanity is saved, rather than considering the Redemption to occur in a cultic or juridical way</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;=== Valentinian Gnosticism ===Valentinian Gnosticism was one of the major forms of Gnosticism that Irenaeus opposed</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to the Gnostic view of Salvation, creation was perfect to begin with; it did not need time to grow and mature</span>
				<span class='text'>For the Valentinians, the material world is the result of the loss of perfection which resulted from [[Sophia (wisdom)#Valentinus|Sophia's]] desire to understand the Forefather</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, one is ultimately redeemed, through secret knowledge, to enter the [[pleroma]] of which the Achamoth originally fell</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to the Valentinian Gnostics, there are three classes of human beings</span>
				<span class='text'>They are the material, who cannot attain salvation; the psychic, who are strengthened by works and faith (they are part of the church); and the spiritual, who cannot decay or be harmed by material actions</span>

				<span class='text'>Spirituals, on the other hand‚Äîthose who obtain this great gift‚Äîare the only class that will eventually attain salvation</span>

				<span class='text'>He writes, &quot;The first, or carnal men, will return to the grossness of matter and finally be consumed by fire; the second, or psychic men, together with the Demiurge as their master, will enter a middle state, neither heaven (pleroma) nor hell (whyle); the purely spiritual men will be completely freed from the influence of the Demiurge and together with the Saviour and Achamoth, his spouse, will enter the pleroma divested of body (h√∫le) and soul (psuch√©)</span>

				<span class='text'> By taking a material body, the Son becomes the Savior and facilitates this entrance into the pleroma by making it possible for the Spirituals to receive his spiritual body</span>
				<span class='text'> However, in becoming a body and soul, the Son Himself becomes one of those needing redemption</span>
				<span class='text'> Therefore, the Word descends onto the Savior at His Baptism in the Jordan, which liberates the Son from his corruptible body and soul</span>
				<span class='text'> His redemption from the body and soul is then applied to the Spirituals</span>

				<span class='text'>It is certain that, while still very young, Irenaeus had seen and heard Bishop [[Polycarp]] (d</span>
				<span class='text'>155) at Smyrna</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Irenaeus sets out a forthright account of Mary's role in the economy of salvation, presenting Mary as as New Eve whose obedience in the Annunciation counters Eve's disobedience</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III</span>
				<span class='text'>2</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; He states, &quot;even though Eve had Adam for a husband, she was still a virgin</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>By disobeying, Eve became the cause of death for herself and for the whole human race</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same way Mary, though she had a husband, was still a virgin, and by obeying, she became the cause of salvation for herself and for the whole human race</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus of Lyons, ''Adversus haereses'' 3</span>
				<span class='text'>2</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;This presentation of Mary as the New Eve is an extension of Irenaeus' Adam-Christ typology</span>
				<span class='text'> Just as Christ undoes Adam's disobedience, Mary undoes Eve's disobedience</span>

				<span class='text'>2</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  His emphasis on Mary's role in the economy of salvation further demonstrates how God transforms the material world through the Incarnation, which was an important part of Irenaeus' conflict with the Gnostics</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Like Ireneaus, Tertullian describes how Christ's Virgin birth parallels Adam's creation from virgin earth</span>
				<span class='text'> Tertullian also discusses how it was necessary for God to be born of a Virgin so that what was lost through a woman would be saved through a woman</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''De Carne Christi'', 17&lt;/ref&gt;  This indicates that the concept of Mary as the New Eve was known in both the Eastern and Western Church during the second and third centuries</span>
