				<span class='text'>' (Leviticus 26:3-ff</span>
				<span class='text'>, as well as read the concluding verse [from the Prophets], 'And it came to pass that Samuel spoke to all of Israel [etc</span>
				<span class='text'>,' and he then concluded by saying that the Ark of God had been taken away</span>
				<span class='text'>Now after certain days they brought up his coffin to the Land of Israel, during which journey thieves encountered them, causing those who had gone up to flee, leaving there the coffin</span>
				<span class='text'>Now the thieves, when they saw that they had all fled, they desired to have the coffin cast into the sea, but were unable with all their strength to uproot the coffin from the ground, even though they had been more than thirty men, and when they considered the matter, they then said to themselves that he was a godly and holy man, and so they went their way</span>
				<span class='text'>However, they gave assurances to the Jews that they would escort them to their destination, and so it was that they also accompanied him and '''he was buried in Tiberias'''</span>

				<span class='text'>uring his lifetime, most Jews greeted Maimonides's writings on Jewish law and ethics with acclaim and gratitude, even as far away as Iraq and Yemen, and although Maimonides rose to become the revered head of the [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Jewish community in Egypt]], there were also vociferous critics of some of his writings, particularly in Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>Nonetheless, he was posthumously acknowledged as among the foremost rabbinical [[Posek|arbiters]] and philosophers in [[Jewish history]], and his copious work comprises a cornerstone of Jewish scholarship</span>
				<span class='text'>His fourteen-volume ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' still carries significant canonical authority as a codification of [[Talmud]]ic law</span>
				<span class='text'>In the [[Yeshiva]] world, he is called sometimes &quot;ha Nesher ha Gadol&quot; (the great eagle) in recognition of his outstanding status as a ''bona fide'' exponent of the [[Oral Torah]]</span>
				<span class='text'>side from being revered by Jewish historians, Maimonides also figures very prominently in the history of Islamic and Arab sciences and is mentioned extensively in studies</span>
				<span class='text'>Influenced by [[Avicenna]] (c</span>

				<span class='text'>872‚Äì950/951), he in his turn influenced other prominent Arab and Muslim philosophers and scientists</span>
				<span class='text'>He became a prominent philosopher and [[polymath]] in both the Jewish and Islamic worlds</span>

				<span class='text'>1: &quot;Maimonides's biography immediately suggests a profound paradox</span>
				<span class='text'>A philosopher by temperament and ideology, a zealous devotee of the contemplative life who eloquently portrayed and yearned for the serenity of solitude and the spiritual exuberance of meditation, he nevertheless led a relentlessly active life that regularly brought him to the brink of exhaustion</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In a famous letter, Maimonides describes his daily routine: After visiting the Sultan's palace, he would arrive home exhausted and hungry, where &quot;I would find the antechambers filled with gentiles and Jews </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I would go to heal them, and write prescriptions for their illnesses </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>until the evening </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and I would be extremely weak</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Responsa Pe‚Äôer HaDor'', 143</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As he goes on to say in this letter, even on the Sabbath he would receive members of the community</span>
				<span class='text'>It is remarkable that he managed to write extended treatises, including not only medical and other scientific studies but some of the most systematically thought-through and influential treatises on [[halakha]] (rabbinic law) and Jewish philosophy of the Middle Ages</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Such views of his works are found in almost all scholarly studies of the man and his significance</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Some more acculturated Jews in the century that followed his death, particularly in Spain, sought to apply Maimonides's Aristotelianism in ways that undercut traditionalist belief and observance, giving rise to an intellectual controversy in Spanish and southern French Jewish circles</span>

				<span class='text'>In reaction, the more radical interpretations of Maimonides were defeated</span>

				<span class='text'>These writings often included considerable philosophical chapters or discussions in support of halakhic observance; David Hartman observes that Maimonides clearly expressed &quot;the traditional support for a philosophical understanding of God both in the Aggadah of Talmud and in the behavior of the hasid [the pious Jew]</span>

				<span class='text'>First, Maimonides had refrained from adding references to his work for the sake of brevity; second, in the introduction, he gave the impression of wanting to &quot;cut out&quot; study of the Talmud,&lt;ref&gt;Last section of Maimonides's Introduction to Mishneh Torah&lt;/ref&gt; to arrive at a conclusion in Jewish law, although Maimonides later wrote that this was not his intent</span>

				<span class='text'>]Through the ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'' (which was initially written in Arabic as ''DalƒÅlat al-·∏•ƒÅ æirƒ´n'') and the philosophical introductions to sections of his commentaries on the Mishna, Maimonides exerted an important influence on the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] philosophers, especially on [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], Thomas Aquinas and [[Duns Scotus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a Jewish Scholastic</span>
				<span class='text'>Educated more by reading the works of Arab Muslim philosophers than by personal contact with Arabian teachers, he acquired an intimate acquaintance not only with Arab Muslim philosophy, but with the doctrines of Aristotle</span>

				<span class='text'>Maimonides is said to have been influenced by [[Asaph ha-Jehoudi]], who was the first [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] medical writer</span>
				<span class='text'>==Negative theology===The principle that inspired his philosophical activity was identical to a fundamental tenet of Scholasticism: there can be no contradiction between the truths which God has revealed and the findings of the human mind in science and philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>Maimonides primarily relied upon the science of Aristotle and the teachings of the Talmud, commonly finding basis in the former for the latter</span>
				<span class='text'>In some important points, he departed from the teaching of Aristotle; for instance, he rejected the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] doctrine that God's provident care extends only to humanity, and not to the individual</span>
				<span class='text'>aimonides admiration for the [[neo-Platonism|neo-Platonic]] commentators led him to doctrines which the later Scholastics did not accept</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance, Maimonides was an adherent of &quot;[[negative theology]]&quot; (also known as &quot;Apophatic theology&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> In this theology, one attempts to describe God through negative attributes</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance, one should not say that God exists in the usual sense of the term; it can be said that God is not non-existent</span>
				<span class='text'>We should not say that &quot;God is wise&quot;; but we can say that &quot;God is not ignorant,&quot; i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> in some way, God has some properties of knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>We should not say that &quot;God is One,&quot; but we can state that &quot;there is no multiplicity in God's being</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In brief, the attempt is to gain and express knowledge of God by describing what God is not, rather than by describing what God &quot;is&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>he Scholastics agreed that no predicate is adequate to express the nature of God, but they did not say that no affirmative term could be applied to God</span>
				<span class='text'>They acknowledged that while the terms &quot;eternal,&quot; &quot;omnipotent,&quot; etc</span>
				<span class='text'> as we apply them to God are inadequate, at the same time we may say &quot;God is eternal&quot; etc</span>
				<span class='text'>We need not stop, as Maimonides did, with the negative &quot;God is not not-eternal,&quot; etc</span>
				<span class='text'>Maimonides suggested that when people give God anthropomorphic qualities, they do not explain anything more of what God is, because people cannot know the essence</span>
				<span class='text'>aimonides's use of apophatic theology is not unique to this time period or to Judaism</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and [[Maximus the Confessor]], [[Eastern Christian]] theologians, had developed apophatic theology for Christianity nearly 900 years earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>See [[Negative theology]] for uses in other religions</span>
				<span class='text'>==Prophecy===He agrees with &quot;the Philosopher&quot; (Aristotle) in teaching that the use of logic is the &quot;right&quot; way of thinking</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to build an inner understanding of how to know God, every human being must, by study, meditation and uncompromising strong will, attain the degree of complete logical, spiritual and physical perfection required in the [[prophet]]ic state</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he rejects previous ideas (especially portrayed by Rabbi Yehuda Halevi in &quot;Hakuzari&quot;) that in order to become a prophet, God must intervene</span>
				<span class='text'>Maimonides claims that any man has the potential to become a prophet (not just Jews) and that in fact it is the purpose of the human race</span>
				<span class='text'>==The problem of evil===Maimonides wrote on [[theodicy]] (the philosophical attempt to reconcile the existence of a God with the existence of evil)</span>

				<span class='text'>He says that there are people who are guided by higher purpose, and there are those who are guided by physicality and must strive to find the higher purpose with which to guide their actions</span>
				<span class='text'>o justify the existence of evil, assuming God is both omnipotent and omnibenevolent, Maimonides postulates that one who created something by causing its opposite not to exist is not the same as creating something that exists; so evil is merely the absence of good</span>
				<span class='text'>God did not create evil, rather God created good, and evil exists where good is absent (Guide 3:10)</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, all good is divine invention, and evil both is not and comes secondarily</span>
				<span class='text'>aimonides contests the common view that evil outweighs good in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>He says that if one were to examine existence only in terms of humanity, then that person may observe evil to dominate good, but if one looks at the whole of the universe, then he sees good is significantly more common than evil (Guide 3:12)</span>
				<span class='text'>Man, he reasons, is too insignificant a figure in God's myriad works to be their primary characterizing force, and so when people see mostly evil in their lives, they are not taking into account the extent of positive Creation outside of themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>aimonides believes that there are three types of evil in the world: evil caused by nature, evil that people bring upon others, and evil man brings upon himself (Guide 3:12)</span>
				<span class='text'>The first type of evil Maimonides states is the rarest form, but arguably of the most necessary‚Äîthe balance of life and death in both the human and animal worlds itself, he recognizes, is essential to God's plan</span>
				<span class='text'>Maimonides writes that the second type of evil is relatively rare, and that humanity brings it upon itself</span>
				<span class='text'>The third type of evil humans bring upon themselves and is the source of most of the ills of the world</span>
				<span class='text'>These are the result of people falling victim to their physical desires</span>
				<span class='text'>To prevent the majority of evil which stems from harm we do to ourselves, we must learn how to ignore our bodily urges</span>

				<span class='text'>om |accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maimonides draws a distinction between &quot;true beliefs,&quot; which were beliefs about God that produced intellectual perfection, and &quot;necessary beliefs,&quot; which were conducive to improving social order</span>
				<span class='text'>Maimonides places anthropomorphic personification statements about God in the latter class</span>
				<span class='text'> He uses as an example the notion that God becomes &quot;angry&quot; with people who do wrong</span>
				<span class='text'> In the view of Maimonides (taken from [[Avicenna]]), God does not become angry with people, as God has no human passions; but it is important for them to believe God does, so that they desist from doing wrong</span>
				<span class='text'>==Resurrection, acquired immortality, and the afterlife===Maimonides distinguishes two kinds of intelligence in man, the one material in the sense of being dependent on, and influenced by, the body, and the other immaterial, that is, independent of the bodily organism</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter is a direct emanation from the universal [[active intellect]]; this is his interpretation of the ''no√ªs poietik√≥s'' of Aristotelian philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>It is acquired as the result of the efforts of the soul to attain a correct knowledge of the absolute, pure intelligence of God</span>
				<span class='text'>he knowledge of God is a form of knowledge which develops in us the immaterial intelligence, and thus confers on man an immaterial, spiritual nature</span>
				<span class='text'>This confers on the soul that perfection in which human happiness consists, and endows the soul with [[immortality]]</span>
				<span class='text'>One who has attained a correct knowledge of God has reached a condition of existence, which renders him immune from all the accidents of fortune, from all the allurements of sin, and from death itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Man is in a position to work out his own salvation and his immortality</span>
				<span class='text'>[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]'s doctrine of immortality was strikingly similar</span>
				<span class='text'>But Spinoza teaches that the way to attain the knowledge which confers immortality is the progress from sense-knowledge through scientific knowledge to philosophical intuition of all things ''sub specie √¶ternitatis'', while Maimonides holds that the road to perfection and immortality is the path of duty as described in the [[Torah]] and the rabbinic understanding of the [[oral law]]</span>
				<span class='text'>eligious Jews believed in immortality in a spiritual sense, and most believed that the future would include a messianic era and a resurrection of the dead</span>
				<span class='text'>This is the subject of [[Jewish eschatology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Maimonides wrote much on this topic, but in most cases he wrote about the immortality of the soul for people of perfected intellect; his writings were usually ''not'' about the resurrection of dead bodies</span>
				<span class='text'>Rabbis of his day were critical of this aspect of this thought, and there was controversy over his true views</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See: Maimonides's ''Ma'amar Te·∏•ayyath Hamethim'' (Treatise on the Resurrection of the Dead), published in ''Book of Letters and Responsa'' (◊°◊§◊® ◊ê◊í◊®◊ï◊™ ◊ï◊™◊©◊ï◊ë◊ï◊™), Jerusalem 1978, p</span>
				<span class='text'>9 (Hebrew)</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Maimonides, certain Jews in Yemen had sent to him a letter in the year 1189, evidently irritated as to why he had not mentioned the physical resurrection of the dead in his ''Hil</span>
				<span class='text'>Teshuvah'', chapter 8, and how that some persons in Yemen had begun to instruct, based on Maimonides's teaching, that when the body dies it will disintegrate and the soul will never return to such bodies after death</span>
				<span class='text'>Maimonides denied that he ever insinuated such things, and reiterated that the body would indeed resurrect, but that the &quot;world to come&quot; was something different in nature</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Rabbinic works usually refer to this afterlife as ''[[Jewish eschatology|Olam Haba]]'' (the World to Come)</span>
				<span class='text'>Some [[rabbinic literature|rabbinic works]] use this phrase to refer to a messianic era, an era of history here on Earth; in other rabbinic works this phrase refers to a purely spiritual realm</span>
				<span class='text'>During Maimonides's lifetime the debate expanded into a full-blown controversy, with Maimonides charged as a [[heresy|heretic]] by some [[Judaism|Jewish]] leaders</span>
				<span class='text'>ome Jews at this time taught that [[Judaism]] did not require a belief in the physical resurrection of the dead, as the afterlife would be a purely spiritual realm</span>
				<span class='text'>They used Maimonides's works on this subject to back up their position</span>
				<span class='text'>In return, their opponents claimed that this was outright heresy; for them the afterlife was here on Earth, where God would raise dead bodies from the grave so that the resurrected could live eternally</span>
				<span class='text'>Maimonides was brought into this dispute by both sides, as the first group stated that his writings agreed with them, and the second group portrayed him as a heretic for writing that the afterlife is for the immaterial spirit alone</span>
				<span class='text'>ventually, Maimonides felt pressured to write a treatise on the subject, the &quot;''Ma'amar Tehiyyat Hametim''&quot; &quot;The Treatise on Resurrection</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Chapter two of the treatise on resurrection refers to those who believe that the world to come involves physically resurrected bodies</span>
				<span class='text'>Maimonides refers to one with such beliefs, as being an &quot;utter fool&quot; whose belief is &quot;folly&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>If one of the multitude refuses to believe [that angels are incorporeal] and prefers to believe that angels have bodies and even that they eat, since it is written (Genesis 18:8) 'they ate', or that those who exist in the World to Come will also have bodies‚Äîwe won't hold it against him or consider him a heretic, and we will not distance ourselves from him</span>
				<span class='text'>May there not be many who profess this folly, and let us hope that he will go no farther than this in his folly and believe that the Creator is corporeal</span>
				<span class='text'>aimonides also writes, that those who claimed that he believed the verses of the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] referring to the resurrection were only allegorical, were spreading falsehoods and &quot;revolting&quot; statements</span>
				<span class='text'>Maimonides asserts that belief in resurrection is a fundamental truth of Judaism about which there is no disagreement, and that it is not permissible for a Jew to support anyone who believes differently</span>
				<span class='text'>He cites [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 12:2 and 12:13 as definitive proofs of physical resurrection of the dead when they state &quot;many of them that sleep in the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life and some to reproaches and everlasting abhorrence&quot; and &quot;But you, go your way till the end; for you shall rest, and will arise to your inheritance at the end of the days</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;While these two positions may be seen as in contradiction (non-corporeal eternal life, versus a bodily resurrection), Maimonides resolves them with a then unique solution: Maimonides believed that the resurrection was not permanent or general</span>
				<span class='text'>In his view, God never violates the laws of nature</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather, divine interaction is by way of [[angel]]s, whom Maimonides often regards to be metaphors for the laws of nature, the principles by which the physical universe operates, or Platonic eternal forms</span>
				<span class='text'>[This is not always the case</span>
				<span class='text'>In Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah Chaps</span>
				<span class='text'>2‚Äì4, Maimonides describes angels that are actually created beings</span>
				<span class='text'> Thus, if a unique event actually occurs, even if it is perceived as a miracle, it is not a violation of the world's order</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Commentary on the Mishna, Avot 5:6&lt;/ref&gt;In this view, any dead who are resurrected must eventually die again</span>
				<span class='text'>In his discussion of the [[Jewish principles of faith|13 principles of faith]], the first five deal with knowledge of God, the next four deal with prophecy and the Torah, while the last four deal with reward, punishment and the ultimate redemption</span>
				<span class='text'>In this discussion Maimonides says nothing of a universal resurrection</span>
				<span class='text'>All he says it is that whatever resurrection does take place, it will occur at an indeterminate time before the world to come, which he repeatedly states will be purely spiritual</span>
				<span class='text'>e writes &quot;It appears to us on the basis of these verses (Daniel 12:2,13) that those people who will return to those bodies will eat, drink, copulate, beget, and die after a very long life, like the lives of those who will live in the Days of the Messiah</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Maimonides thus disassociated the resurrection of the dead from both the World to Come and the Messianic era</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=November 2014}}In his time, many Jews believed that the physical resurrection was identical to the world to come; thus denial of a permanent and universal resurrection was considered tantamount to denying the words of the Talmudic sages</span>
				<span class='text'>However, instead of denying the resurrection, or maintaining the current dogma, Maimonides posited a third way: That resurrection had nothing to do with the messianic era (here in this world) or with [[Jewish eschatology|Olam Haba]] (◊¢◊ï◊ú◊ù ◊î◊ë◊ê) (the purely spiritual afterlife)</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather, he considered resurrection to be a miracle that the book of Daniel predicted; thus at some point in time we could expect some instances of resurrection to occur temporarily, which would have no place in the final eternal life of the righteous</span>
				<span class='text'>==Messianic era===Perhaps one of Maimonides's most highly acclaimed and renowned writings is his treatise on the Messianic era, written originally in [[Judeo-Arabic]] and which he elaborates on in great detail in his Commentary on the [[Mishnah]] (Introduction to the 10th chapter of [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|tractate Sanhedrin]], also known as ''Pere·∏≥ ·∏§ele·∏≥'')</span>
				<span class='text'>|class=&quot;toccolours&quot;|+ '''Maimonides on the Messianic Era'''|&lt;poem&gt;[[Mishah]] CommentaryTractate Sanhedrin''Pere·∏≥ ·∏§ele·∏≥'' (Chapter 10)&quot;‚Ä¶ 'The days of the Messiah' (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> the Messianic Era) is a timeframe in which the kingdom shall return to Israel, and they (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> the people of Israel) will return to the Land of Israel, and the king who shall stand-up will establish the place of his kingdom in Zion, whose name shall be extolled and it will reach unto the ends of the earth, being [even] greater than Solomon's kingdom, and the nations will enter a covenant of peace with him, and all lands shall serve him on account of the abundance of his righteousness, and for the wondrous things that shall be revealed through him; whosoever shall rise-up against him, the Lord will cut him off and deliver him into his hands</span>
				<span class='text'>All of the Scriptural verses bear witness of him, and of us with him, but there is nothing which exists now that will change, excepting that the kingdom will be given over to Israel; thus have we heard it in the language used by the Sages: 'There is no difference between this world and the days of the Messiah, excepting only the subjugation of kingdoms' &lt;small&gt;(San</span>
				<span class='text'>91b)&lt;/small&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>There shall remain in his days, both, the strong and the weak, in comparison to others, only that in those days the people's livelihood will be made much easier for them, insofar that if a man should work any work no matter how short-lived, he will gain much thereby</span>
				<span class='text'>This is that which they have spoken about, saying: 'In the future, the Land of Israel shall produce sweet-rolls of bread and clothes made of white woollen fabric' &lt;small&gt;(Shab</span>
				<span class='text'>30b)&lt;/small&gt;, seeing that people will say whenever a man finds something ready [and prepared for use] in abundance that so-and-so has found baked bread and a cooked dish, the proof of which being what is written: 'And the sons of the stranger shall be your field workers and vine dressers' &lt;small&gt;(Isa</span>
				<span class='text'>61:5)&lt;/small&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>Meaning, a time of ploughing and a time of reaping will be there; Wherefore, it was for this reason that that erudite man who said these things{{efn|name=a}} was angered at his disciple when he failed to understand their import and had thought rather that these things should be understood in their plain sense, and he was compelled to answer him in a way that he'd understand, even though that wasn't the proper response [to give him]</span>
				<span class='text'>The evidence for this, ''viz''</span>
				<span class='text'> that he didn't give him a truthful answer in accordance with what he learned of the verse, is this: 'Don't answer a foolish man in accordance with his folly' &lt;small&gt;(Proverbs 26:4)&lt;/small&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>ow the greatest advantage at that time will be that we'll have rest from the subjugation of the wicked kingdom, which prevents us from performing that which God has enjoined unto us to do, while knowledge will be vastly increased, as it says: 'For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lo-rd' &lt;small&gt;(Isa</span>
				<span class='text'>11:9)&lt;/small&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, battles and wars will come to an end, as it says: 'Nation shall not lift up a sword against nation' &lt;small&gt;(Micha 4:3)&lt;/small&gt;, while all those who will be in those days will attain to great perfection, by which he will merit the world to come</span>
				<span class='text'>The Messiah will then die [as all men], and his son, and his son's son will rule after him</span>
				<span class='text'>Now God has already described his death; he says: 'He shall not tire nor be weary, till he establish judgment in the earth: and the isles shall hope for his law' &lt;small&gt;(Isa</span>
				<span class='text'>42:4)&lt;/small&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>His kingdom shall continue for a very long time, while the lives of men will also be prolonged; for by the absence of worries and troubles they shall prolong their lives</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither should it seem strange that his kingdom will continue for thousands of years, inasmuch as the Sages have already said that no matter how noble the things that are collected together, when they are but few that are amassed together, they will fall apart</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, we do not desire the days of the Messiah so that our grain and possessions might increase, or so that we can mount horses, or be engaged in revelry of drink and musical instruments, as those who are confused may think</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather, the prophets fervently desired them and the pious men longed for them because of what shall be there of the ingathering of righteous men, and of proper conduct, and wisdom, and the uprightness of the king and his great wisdom and his drawing nigh unto the Creator, just as it was said of him: 'Thou art my son, [etc</span>
				<span class='text'>' &lt;small&gt;(Psalm 2:7)&lt;/small&gt;, as well as the observance of the entire Law of Moses, without worries and without fear, and without constraint, just as He has promised 'And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD</span>
				<span class='text'>For they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them' &lt;small&gt;(Jer</span>
				<span class='text'>31:33 [34])&lt;/small&gt;; 'and I shall put my Law in their heart,' 'and I shall remove the heart of stone from your flesh' &lt;small&gt;(Ezek</span>
				<span class='text'>36:26)&lt;/small&gt;, and there are many similar verses that speak of such matters</span>
				<span class='text'>It is in this manner [that a man] will acquire the next world with a firm acquisition, while the desired end [of every man] is the world to come, and all that comes before it is [merely] human effort</span>
				<span class='text'>herefore, he that can perceive the truth has looked at the ultimate purpose of life and has forsaken all other things, whereby He says: 'All of Israel has a portion in the world to come</span>
				<span class='text'> Moreover, seeing that this is the desired end and purpose of one's life, it is not fitting that he who wishes to serve [his Maker] out of love should serve Him for the sole intent of attaining the next world, as we have premised earlier, but rather that he may serve Him in the manner that I shall prescribe, ''viz''</span>
				<span class='text'> that if he has already come to believe that knowledge has been imparted unto the prophets from God, and that by it (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> that knowledge) He has revealed to them that the [coveted] virtues are such and such, and the faults are such and such, it behooves him, therefore, by reason of his being a moderate man of reason, to draw near to the virtues and to shun that which is deficient</span>
				<span class='text'>If he has done this, Lo! He would have completed the mortal chapter [related to his existence], and he is then distinguished from the [brute] beasts; and since he would have become a [more] perfect man, one of the virtues of man is that no hindrance be found that will hinder him from attaining life for his soul in what is his remaining [spiritual] existence through her (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> the soul's) [continued] consciousness,{{efn|name=b}} and which is the world to come as we have explained</span>
				<span class='text'>{efn|name=c}}  Moreover, it is that which is said: 'Be ye not like a horse, [or] like a mule, which has no understanding; [who must be held back by bit and bridle]' &lt;small&gt;(Psalm 32:9)&lt;/small&gt;, meaning, the thing that prevents them from idleness and uncontrollable conduct is an external thing like a bit and a bridle</span>
				<span class='text'>May a man never be like this, but rather, let his soul be what stops him from acting in such a manner, that is to say, his [inner] human form{{efn|name=d}} [given to man by God at the hour of Creation] ‚Äì if it were perfected, it will prevent him from whatever thing that withholds from him perfection (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> the betterment of his condition), which things are called deficiencies, but it will spurn him on in whatever is considered wholesome, which things are the virtues</span>

				<span class='text'>Most of Maimonides's works were written in [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' was written in Hebrew</span>
				<span class='text'>His Jewish texts were:* ''[[Mishnah#Commentaries|Commentary on the Mishna]]'' (Hebrew ''Pirush Hamishnayot'', Arabic ''Kitab al-Siraj''),  written in Judeo-Arabic</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the first full commentary ever written on the entire Mishnah, and it enjoyed great popularity both in its Arabic original and its medieval Hebrew translation</span>
				<span class='text'>The commentary includes three philosophical introductions which were also highly influential:** The Introduction to the Mishnah deals with the nature of the oral law, the distinction between the prophet and the sage, and the organizational structure of the Mishnah</span>
				<span class='text'>* The Introduction to Mishnah Sanhedrin, chapter ten (''Perek Helek''), is an eschatological essay that concludes with Maimonides's famous creed (&quot;the thirteen principles of the Torah&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>* The Introduction to Tractate ''Avot'' (popularly called ''The Eight Chapters'') is an ethical treatise</span>
				<span class='text'> ''[[Sefer Hamitzvot]]'' (trans</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Book of Commandments'')</span>
				<span class='text'>In this work, Maimonides lists all the 613 mitzvot traditionally contained in the Torah (Pentateuch)</span>
				<span class='text'>He describes fourteen shorashim (roots or principles) to guide his selection</span>
				<span class='text'> Sefer Ha'shamad (letter of Martydom)* ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', also known as ''Sefer Yad ha-Chazaka'', a comprehensive [[code of law|code]] of Jewish law;* ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'', a philosophical work harmonising and differentiating Aristotle's philosophy and Jewish theology</span>

				<span class='text'> The work illustrates the essentials of Aristotelian logic to be found in the teachings of the great Arabic philosophers such as Avicenna and, above all, [[Al-Farabi]], &quot;the Second Master,&quot; the &quot;First Master&quot; being [[Aristotle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In his work devoted to the Treatise, [[R√©mi Brague]] stresses the fact that Al-Farabi is the only philosopher mentioned therein</span>
				<span class='text'>This indicates a line of conduct for the reader, who must read the text keeping in mind Al-Farabi's works on logic</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Hebrew versions, the Treatise is called ''The words of Logic'' which describes the bulk of the work</span>
				<span class='text'>The author explains the technical meaning of the words used by logicians</span>
				<span class='text'>The Treatise duly inventories the terms used by the logician and indicates what they refer to</span>
				<span class='text'>The work proceeds rationally through a lexicon of philosophical terms to a summary of higher philosophical topics, in 14 chapters corresponding to Maimonides's birthdate of 14 Nissan</span>
				<span class='text'>The number 14 recurs in many of Maimonides's works</span>
				<span class='text'>Each chapter offers a cluster of associated notions</span>
				<span class='text'>The meaning of the words is explained and illustrated with examples</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of each chapter, the author carefully draws up the list of words studied</span>
				<span class='text'>ntil very recently, it was accepted that Maimonides wrote the ''Treatise on logic'' in his twenties or even in his teen&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Heschel, ''Maimonides''</span>
