				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; {{OldStyleDate|24 March|1733|13 March}} – 6 February 1804) was an 18th-century English theologian, [[English Dissenters|dissenting]] clergyman, [[Natural philosophy|natural philosopher]], [[chemistry|chemist]], educator, and [[Liberalism|Liberal]] [[Political philosophy|political theorist]] who published over 150 works</span>
				<span class='text'>He is usually credited with the discovery of [[oxygen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=General Chemistry |edition=4th |author=H</span>
				<span class='text'>I</span>
				<span class='text'>Schlesinger |year=1950 |page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; having isolated it in its gaseous state, although [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] and [[Antoine Lavoisier]] also have a claim to the discovery</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 53–60; Schofield (2004), 112–13</span>
				<span class='text'>The difficulty in precisely defining the time and place of the &quot;discovery&quot; of oxygen, within the context of the developing [[chemical revolution]], is one of [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s central illustrations of the gradual nature of [[paradigm shift]]s in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;During his lifetime, Priestley's considerable scientific reputation rested on his invention of [[soda water]], his writings on [[electricity]], and his discovery of several &quot;airs&quot; (gases), the most famous being what Priestley dubbed &quot;dephlogisticated air&quot; (oxygen)</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Priestley's determination to defend [[phlogiston theory]] and to reject what would become the [[chemical revolution]] eventually left him isolated within the scientific community</span>
				<span class='text'>riestley's science was integral to his theology, and he consistently tried to fuse [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] rationalism with Christian theism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tapper, 10</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In his metaphysical texts, Priestley attempted to combine [[theism]], [[materialism]], and [[determinism]], a project that has been called &quot;audacious and original&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Tap314/&gt; He believed that a proper understanding of the natural world would promote human [[Progress (history)|progress]] and eventually bring about the [[Millennialism|Christian Millennium]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Tap314&gt;Tapper, 314</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Priestley, who strongly believed in the free and open exchange of ideas, advocated [[religious toleration|toleration]] and equal rights for [[English Dissenters|religious Dissenters]], which also led him to help found [[Unitarianism]] [[History of Unitarianism#England|in England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The controversial nature of Priestley's publications combined with his outspoken support of the [[French Revolution]] aroused public and governmental suspicion; he was eventually forced to flee, in 1791, first to London, and then to the United States, after [[Priestley Riots|a mob burned down his home and church]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent the last ten years of his life living in [[Northumberland County, Pennsylvania]]</span>
				<span class='text'> scholar and teacher throughout his life, Priestley also made significant contributions to [[pedagogy]], including the publication of a seminal work on [[Grammar#History|English grammar]], books on history, and he prepared some of the most influential early timelines</span>
				<span class='text'>These educational writings were some of Priestley's most popular works</span>
				<span class='text'>It was his metaphysical works, however, that had the most lasting influence: leading philosophers including [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Herbert Spencer]] credit them among the primary sources for [[utilitarianism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{TOC limit|limit=3}}==Early life and education (1733–55)==[[File:PriestleyBirthplace</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Priestley's birthplace (since demolished) in Fieldhead, [[Birstall, West Yorkshire]] (about six miles (10 km) southwest of [[Leeds]])&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;|alt=Black-and-white drawing of a two-story brick house along a road</span>
				<span class='text'>]Priestley was born to an established English [[English Dissenters|Dissenting]] family (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>they did not conform to the [[Church of England]]) in [[Birstall, West Yorkshire|Birstall]], near [[Batley]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the oldest of six children born to Mary Swift and Jonas Priestley, a [[finishing (textiles)|finisher]] of cloth</span>
				<span class='text'>To ease his mother's burdens, Priestley was sent to live with his grandfather around the age of one</span>
				<span class='text'>He returned home, five years later, after his mother died</span>
				<span class='text'>When his father remarried in 1741, Priestley went to live with his aunt and uncle, the wealthy and childless Sarah and John Keighley, {{convert|3|mi|km}} from Fieldhead</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;odnb&quot;&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=22788|title=Priestley, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Priestley was precocious—at the age of four he could flawlessly recite all 107 questions and answers of the [[Westminster Shorter Catechism]]—his aunt sought the best education for the boy, intending him for the ministry</span>
				<span class='text'>During his youth, Priestley attended local schools where he learned Greek, Latin, and Hebrew</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 2–12; Uglow, 72; Jackson, 19–25; Gibbs, 1–4; Thorpe, 1–11; Holt, 1–6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Around 1749, Priestley became seriously ill and believed he was dying</span>
				<span class='text'>Raised as a devout [[Calvinist]], he believed a [[Conversion to Christianity|conversion experience]] was necessary for salvation, but doubted he had had one</span>
				<span class='text'>This emotional distress eventually led him to question his theological upbringing, causing him to reject [[Unconditional election|election]] and to accept [[Universal reconciliation|universal salvation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, the elders of his home church, the [[Independent (religion)|Independent]] Upper Chapel of [[Heckmondwike]], refused him admission as a full member</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Priestley's illness left him with a permanent stutter and he gave up any thoughts of entering the ministry at that time</span>
				<span class='text'>In preparation for joining a relative in trade in [[Lisbon]], he studied French, Italian, and German in addition to [[Aramaic]], and Arabic</span>
				<span class='text'>He was tutored by the Reverend George Haggerstone, who first introduced him to higher mathematics, [[natural philosophy]], logic, and [[metaphysics]] through the works of [[Isaac Watts]], [[Willem 's Gravesande]], and [[John Locke]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 14, 28–29; Uglow, 72; Gibbs, 5; Thorpe, 11–12; Holt, 7–9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Daventry Academy===Priestley eventually decided to return to his theological studies and, in 1752, matriculated at [[Daventry Academy|Daventry]], a Dissenting academy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 28–29; Jackson, 30; Gibbs, 5</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Because he had already read widely, Priestley was allowed to skip the first two years of coursework</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued his intense study; this, together with the liberal atmosphere of the school, shifted his theology further leftward and he became a [[English Dissenters#Rational Dissenters|Rational Dissenter]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Abhorring dogma and religious mysticism, Rational Dissenters emphasised the rational analysis of the natural world and the Bible</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McEvoy (1983), 48–49</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Priestley later wrote that the book that influenced him the most, save the Bible, was [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley's]] ''[[Observations on Man]]'' (1749)</span>
				<span class='text'>Hartley's psychological, philosophical, and theological treatise postulated a material [[Philosophy of mind|theory of mind]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!-- &quot;philosophy of mind&quot; link is better than &quot;theory of mind&quot; --&gt; Hartley aimed to construct a Christian philosophy in which both religious and moral &quot;facts&quot; could be scientifically proven, a goal that would occupy Priestley for his entire life</span>
				<span class='text'>In his third year at Daventry, Priestley committed himself to the ministry, which he described as &quot;the noblest of all professions&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 62–69</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Priestley yearned for urban life and theological debate, whereas Needham Market was a small, rural town with a congregation wedded to tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>Attendance and donations dropped sharply when they discovered the extent of his [[heterodoxy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Priestley's aunt had promised her support if he became a minister, she refused any further assistance when she realised he was no longer a [[Calvinist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To earn extra money, Priestley proposed opening a school, but local families informed him that they would refuse to send their children</span>
				<span class='text'>He also presented a series of scientific lectures titled &quot;Use of the Globes&quot; that was more successful</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 62–69; Jackson, 44–47; Gibbs, 10–11; Thorpe, 22–29; Holt, 15–19</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Priestley's Daventry friends helped him obtain another position and in 1758 he moved to [[Nantwich]], Cheshire; this time there was happier</span>
				<span class='text'>The congregation cared less about Priestley's heterodoxy and he successfully established a school</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike many schoolmasters of the time, Priestley taught his students [[natural philosophy]] and even bought scientific instruments for them</span>
				<span class='text'>Appalled at the quality of the available English grammar books, Priestley wrote his own: ''[[The Rudiments of English Grammar]]'' (1761)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph</span>

				<span class='text'>Griffiths, 1761</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His innovations in the description of English grammar, particularly his efforts to dissociate it from [[Grammar#History|Latin grammar]], led 20th-century scholars to describe him as &quot;one of the great grammarians of his time&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Qtd</span>
				<span class='text'>in Schofield (1997), 79</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of ''Rudiments'' and the success of Priestley's school, [[Warrington Academy]] offered him a teaching position in 1761</span>

				<span class='text'>He fitted in well at Warrington, and made friends quickly</span>
				<span class='text'>On 23 June 1762, he married Mary Wilkinson of [[Wrexham]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Of his marriage, Priestley wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;This proved a very suitable and happy connexion, my wife being a woman of an excellent understanding, much improved by reading, of great fortitude and strength of mind, and of a temper in the highest degree affectionate and generous; feeling strongly for others, and little for herself</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, greatly excelling in every thing relating to household affairs, she entirely relieved me of all concern of that kind, which allowed me to give all my time to the prosecution of my studies, and the other duties of my station</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Priestley, ''Autobiography'', 87</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;On 17 April 1763, they had a daughter, whom they named Sarah after Priestley's aunt</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Educator and historian==={{further2|[[Joseph Priestley and education]]}}All of the books Priestley published while at Warrington emphasised the study of history; Priestley considered it essential for worldly success as well as religious growth</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote histories of science and Christianity in an effort to reveal the progress of humanity and, paradoxically, the loss of a pure, &quot;primitive Christianity&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Lectures on History and General Policy]]'' (1788), and other works, Priestley argued that the education of the young should anticipate their future practical needs</span>
				<span class='text'>This principle of utility guided his unconventional curricular choices for Warrington's aspiring middle-class students</span>
				<span class='text'>He recommended modern languages instead of classical languages and modern rather than ancient history</span>
				<span class='text'>Priestley's lectures on history were particularly revolutionary; he narrated a [[providentialism|providentialist]] and naturalist account of history, arguing that the study of history furthered the comprehension of God's natural laws</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, his [[millennialism|millennial]] perspective was closely tied to his optimism regarding scientific progress and the improvement of humanity</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed that each age would improve upon the previous and that the study of history allowed people to perceive and to advance this progress</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the study of history was a moral imperative for Priestley, he also promoted the education of middle-class women, which was unusual at the time</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 121; see also Watts, 92</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; ''Lectures on History'' was well received and was employed by many educational institutions, such as New College at Hackney,&lt;!-- Is this [[Homerton College, Cambridge]]? --&gt; [[Brown University|Brown]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Yale]], and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]</span>

				<span class='text'>--&gt;The intellectually stimulating atmosphere of Warrington, often called the &quot;Athens of the North&quot; (of England) during the 18th century, encouraged Priestley's growing interest in natural philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>He gave lectures on anatomy and performed experiments regarding temperature with another tutor at Warrington, his friend [[John Seddon of Warrington|John Seddon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 136–37; Jackson, 57–61</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Despite Priestley's busy teaching schedule, he decided to write a history of electricity</span>
				<span class='text'>Friends introduced him to the major experimenters in the field in Britain—[[John Canton]], [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]], and the visiting [[Benjamin Franklin]]—who encouraged Priestley to perform the experiments he wanted to include in his history</span>
				<span class='text'>In the process of replicating others' experiments, Priestley became intrigued by unanswered questions and was prompted to undertake experiments of his own design</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; (Impressed with his ''Charts'' and the manuscript of his history of electricity, Canton, Franklin, Watson, and [[Richard Price]] nominated Priestley for a fellowship in the [[Royal Society]]; he was accepted in 1766</span>

				<span class='text'>This and other experiments on the electrical properties of materials and on the electrical effects of chemical transformations demonstrated Priestley's early and ongoing interest in the relationship between chemical substances and electricity</span>

				<span class='text'>riestley's strength as a natural philosopher was qualitative rather than quantitative and his observation of &quot;a current of real air&quot; between two electrified points would later interest [[Michael Faraday]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] as they investigated [[electromagnetism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Priestley's text became the standard history of electricity for over a century; [[Alessandro Volta]] (who later invented the battery), [[William Herschel]] (who discovered [[infrared radiation]]), and [[Henry Cavendish]] (who discovered [[hydrogen]]) all relied upon it</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]Perhaps prompted by Mary Priestley's ill health, or financial problems, or a desire to prove himself to the community that had rejected him in his childhood, Priestley moved with his family from Warrington to [[Leeds]] in 1767, and he became [[Mill Hill Chapel]]'s minister</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;|Priestley had been working on ''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]'' since his Daventry days</span>
				<span class='text'>]When Priestley became its minister, [[Mill Hill Chapel]] was one of the oldest and most respected [[English Dissenters|Dissenting congregations in England]]; however, during the early 18th century the congregation had fractured along doctrinal lines, and was losing members to the charismatic [[Methodism#Wesleyan revival|Methodist movement]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 165–69; Holt, 42–43</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Priestley believed that by educating the young, he could strengthen the bonds of the congregation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 170–71; Gibbs, 37; Watts, 93–94; Holt, 44</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In his magisterial three-volume ''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]'' (1772–74),&lt;ref&gt;Priestley</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>London: Printed for J</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson, Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>I, 1772, Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>II, 1773, Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>III, 1774</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Priestley outlined his theories of religious instruction</span>
				<span class='text'>More importantly, he laid out his belief in [[Socinianism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The doctrines he explicated would become the standards for [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] in Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>This work marked a change in Priestley's theological thinking that is critical to understanding his later writings—it paved the way for his [[materialism]] and [[necessitarianism]] (the belief that a divine being acts in accordance with necessary metaphysical laws)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Miller, xvi; Schofield (1997), 172</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Priestley's major argument in the ''Institutes'' was that the only revealed religious truths that could be accepted were those that matched one's experience of the natural world</span>
				<span class='text'>Because his views of religion were deeply tied to his understanding of nature, the text's [[theism]] rested on the [[argument from design]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 174; Uglow, 169; Tapper, 315; Holt, 44</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The ''Institutes'' shocked and appalled many readers, primarily because it challenged basic Christian orthodoxies, such as the [[Christ|divinity of Christ]] and the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|miracle of the Virgin Birth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Methodists in Leeds penned a hymn asking God to &quot;the Unitarian fiend expel / And chase his doctrine back to Hell</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Qtd</span>
				<span class='text'>in Jackson, 102</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Priestley wanted to return Christianity to its &quot;primitive&quot; or &quot;pure&quot; form by eliminating the &quot;corruptions&quot; which had accumulated over the centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>The fourth part of the ''Institutes'', ''[[An History of the Corruptions of Christianity]]'', became so long that he was forced to issue it separately in 1782</span>
				<span class='text'>Priestley believed that the ''Corruptions'' was &quot;the most valuable&quot; work he ever published</span>
				<span class='text'>In demanding that his readers apply the logic of the emerging sciences and comparative history to the Bible and Christianity, he alienated religious and scientific readers alike—scientific readers did not appreciate seeing science used in the defence of religion and religious readers dismissed the application of science to religion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McLachlan (1987–90), 261; Gibbs, 38; Jackson, 102; Uglow, 169</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Religious controversialist===Priestley engaged in numerous political and religious [[pamphlet]] wars</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Schofield, &quot;he entered each controversy with a cheerful conviction that he was right, while most of his opponents were convinced, from the outset, that he was willfully and maliciously wrong</span>
				<span class='text'>He was able, then, to contrast his sweet reasonableness to their personal rancor&quot;,&lt;ref name=S181&gt;Schofield (1997), 181</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; but as Schofield points out Priestley rarely altered his opinion as a result of these debates</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=S181/&gt; While at Leeds he wrote controversial pamphlets on the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]] and on [[Calvinist]] doctrine; thousands of copies were published, making them some of Priestley's most widely read works</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See Schofield (1997), 181–88 for analysis of these two controversies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Priestley founded the ''[[Theological Repository]]'' in 1768, a journal committed to the open and rational inquiry of theological questions</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he promised to print any contribution, only like-minded authors submitted articles</span>
				<span class='text'>He was therefore obliged to provide much of the journal's content himself (this material became the basis for many of his later theological and metaphysical works)</span>
				<span class='text'>After only a few years, due to a lack of funds, he was forced to cease publishing the journal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See Schofield (1997), 193–201 for an analysis of the journal; Uglow, 169; Holt, 53–55</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He revived it in 1784 with similar results</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;]]Many of Priestley's political writings supported the repeal of the [[Test Act|Test]] and [[Corporation Act 1661|Corporation Acts]], which restricted the rights of Dissenters</span>
				<span class='text'>They could not hold political office, serve in the armed forces, or attend Oxford and Cambridge unless they subscribed to the [[Thirty-nine Articles]] of the [[Church of England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Dissenters repeatedly petitioned Parliament to repeal the Acts, arguing that they were being treated as second-class citizens</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 202–05; Holt, 56–64</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Priestley's friends, particularly other Rational Dissenters, urged him to publish a work on the injustices experienced by Dissenters; the result was his ''[[Essay on the First Principles of Government]]'' (1768)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; An early work of [[Liberalism|modern liberal political theory]] and Priestley's most thorough treatment of the subject, it—unusually for the time—distinguished political rights from civil rights with precision and argued for expansive civil rights</span>
				<span class='text'>Priestley identified separate private and public spheres, contending that the government should only have control over the public sphere</span>
				<span class='text'>Education and religion, in particular, he maintained, were matters of private conscience and should not be administered by the state</span>
				<span class='text'>Priestley's later radicalism emerged from his belief that the British government was infringing upon these individual freedoms</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Priestley also defended the rights of Dissenters against the attacks of [[William Blackstone]], an eminent legal theorist, whose ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (1765–69) had become the standard legal guide</span>
				<span class='text'>Blackstone's book stated that dissent from the Church of England was a crime and that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>Furious, Priestley lashed out with his ''Remarks on Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Blackstone's Commentaries'' (1769), correcting Blackstone's interpretation of the law, his grammar (a highly politicised subject at the time), and history</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph</span>

				<span class='text'>Payne, 1769</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Blackstone, chastened, altered subsequent editions of his ''Commentaries'': he rephrased the offending passages and removed the sections claiming that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects, but he retained his description of Dissent as a crime</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 214–16; Gibbs, 43; Holt, 48–49</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Natural philosopher: electricity, ''Optics'', and soda water===Although Priestley claimed that [[natural philosophy]] was only a hobby, he took it seriously</span>
				<span class='text'>In his ''History of Electricity'', he described the scientist as promoting the &quot;security and happiness of mankind&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Qtd</span>
				<span class='text'>in Kramnick, 8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Priestley's science was eminently practical and he rarely concerned himself with theoretical questions; his model was [[Benjamin Franklin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When he moved to Leeds, Priestley continued his electrical and chemical experiments (the latter aided by a steady supply of carbon dioxide from a neighbouring brewery)</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1767 and 1770, he presented five papers to the [[Royal Society]] from these initial experiments; the first four papers explored [[coronal discharge]]s and other phenomena related to [[electrical discharge]], while the fifth reported on the conductivity of charcoals from different sources</span>
				<span class='text'>His subsequent experimental work focused on chemistry and [[pneumatics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 227, 232–38; see also Gibbs, 47; Kramnick, 9–10</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Priestley published the first volume of his projected history of experimental philosophy,&lt;!-- do not link to [[experimental philosophy]] - that page describes a separate modern discipline --&gt; ''The History and Present State of Discoveries Relating to Vision, Light and Colours'' (referred to as his ''Optics''), in 1772</span>

				<span class='text'>Leeds: n</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> 1771</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He paid careful attention to the history of optics and presented excellent explanations of early optics experiments, but his mathematical deficiencies caused him to dismiss several important contemporary theories</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, he did not include any of the practical sections that had made his ''History of Electricity'' so useful to practising natural philosophers</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike his ''History of Electricity'', it was not popular and had only one edition, although it was the only English book on the topic for 150 years</span>
				<span class='text'>The hastily written text sold poorly; the cost of researching, writing, and publishing the ''Optics'' convinced Priestley to abandon his history of experimental philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 240–49; Gibbs, 50–55; Uglow, 134</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Priestley was considered for the position of astronomer on [[James Cook]]'s [[James Cook#Second voyage (1772–75)|second voyage to the South Seas]], but was not chosen</span>
				<span class='text'>Still, he contributed in a small way to the voyage: he provided the crew with a method for making [[carbonated water|soda water]], which he erroneously speculated might be a cure for [[scurvy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He then published a pamphlet with ''Directions for Impregnating Water with Fixed Air'' (1772)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph</span>
				<span class='text'>''Directions for impregnating water with fixed air; in order to communicate to it the peculiar spirit and virtues of Pyrmont water, and other mineral waters of a similar nature''</span>
				<span class='text'>London: Printed for J</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson, 1772</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Priestley did not exploit the commercial potential of soda water, but others such as {{nowrap|[[Johann Jacob Schweppe|J</span>
				<span class='text'>J</span>
				<span class='text'>Schweppe]]}} made fortunes from it</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1773, the Royal Society recognised Priestley's achievements in natural philosophy by awarding him the [[Copley Medal]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 251–55; see Holt, 64; Gibbs, 55–56; and Thorpe, 80–81, for the traditional account of this story</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Priestley's friends wanted to find him a more financially secure position</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1772, prompted by [[Richard Price]] and Benjamin Franklin, [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]] wrote to Priestley asking him to direct the education of his children and to act as his general assistant</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Priestley was reluctant to sacrifice his ministry, he accepted the position, resigning from Mill Hill Chapel on 20 December 1772, and preaching his last sermon on 16 May 1773</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 270–71; Jackson, 120–22; Gibbs, 84–86: Uglow, 239–40; Holt, 64–65</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Upon their return, Priestley easily fulfilled his duties as librarian and tutor</span>
				<span class='text'>The workload was intentionally light, allowing him time to pursue his scientific investigations and theological interests</span>
				<span class='text'>Priestley also became a political adviser to Shelburne, gathering information on parliamentary issues and serving as a liaison between Shelburne and the Dissenting and American interests</span>
				<span class='text'>When the Priestleys' third son was born on 24 May 1777, they named him Henry at the lord's request</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 72</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]Priestley wrote his most important philosophical works during his years with Lord Shelburne</span>
				<span class='text'>In a series of major [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] texts published between 1774 and 1780—''An Examination of Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Reid's Inquiry into the Human Mind'' (1774), ''Hartley's Theory of the Human Mind on the Principle of the Association of Ideas'' (1775), ''[[Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit]]'' (1777), ''[[The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated]]'' (1777), and ''[[Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever]]'' (1780)—he argues for a philosophy that incorporates four concepts: [[determinism]], [[materialism]], [[causality|causation]], and [[necessitarianism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By studying the natural world, he argued, people would learn how to become more compassionate, happy, and prosperous</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McEvoy and McGuire, 326–27; Tapper, 316</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Priestley strongly suggested that there is no [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind-body duality]], and put forth a materialist philosophy in these works; that is, one founded on the principle that everything in the universe is made of matter that we can perceive</span>
				<span class='text'>He also contended that discussing the soul is impossible because it is made of a divine substance, and humanity cannot perceive the divine</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his separation of the divine from the mortal, this position shocked and angered many of his readers, who believed that such a duality was necessary for the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] to exist</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 59–76; Gibbs, 99–100; Holt, 112–24; McEvoy and McGuire, 333–34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Responding to [[Baron d'Holbach]]'s ''[[The System of Nature|Système de la Nature]]'' (1770) and [[David Hume]]'s ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779) as well as the works of the French ''philosophers'', Priestley maintained that materialism and determinism could be reconciled with a belief in God</span>
				<span class='text'>He criticised those whose faith was shaped by books and fashion, drawing an analogy between the scepticism of educated men and the credulity of the masses</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tapper, 320; Priestley, ''Autobiography'', 111; Schofield (2004), 37–42; Holt, 93–94; 139–42</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Maintaining that humans had no [[free will]], Priestley argued that what he called &quot;philosophical necessity&quot; (akin to [[determinism|absolute determinism]]) is consonant with Christianity, a position based on his understanding of the natural world</span>
				<span class='text'>Like the rest of nature, man's mind is subject to the laws of causation, Priestley contended, but because a benevolent God created these laws, the world and the people in it will eventually be perfected</span>
				<span class='text'>Evil is therefore only an imperfect understanding of the world</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Founder of Unitarianism==={{See also|History of Unitarianism}}When Priestley's friend [[Theophilus Lindsey]] decided to found a new Christian denomination that would not restrict its members' beliefs, Priestley and others hurried to his aid</span>
				<span class='text'>On 17 April 1774, Lindsey held the first [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] service in Britain, at the newly formed [[Essex Street Chapel]] in London; he had even designed his own liturgy, of which many were critical</span>

				<span class='text'>A dead mouse rests under one glass canister</span>
				<span class='text'>]Priestley's years in Calne were the only ones in his life dominated by scientific investigations; they were also the most scientifically fruitful</span>
				<span class='text'>His experiments were almost entirely confined to &quot;airs&quot;, and out of this work emerged his most important scientific texts: the six volumes of ''[[Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air]]'' (1774–86)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>London W</span>
				<span class='text'>Bowyer and J</span>
				<span class='text'>Nichols, 1774–77</span>
				<span class='text'>There are several different editions of these volumes, each important</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Gibbs 67–83 for a description of all of Priestley's experiments during this time; Thorpe, 170ff</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; These experiments helped repudiate the last vestiges of the [[Classical element|theory of four elements]], which Priestley attempted to replace with his own variation of [[phlogiston theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to that 18th-century theory, the combustion or [[redox|oxidation]] of a substance corresponded to the release of a material substance, ''phlogiston''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, 167–68; Schofield (2004), 98–101</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Priestley's work on &quot;airs&quot; is not easily classified</span>
				<span class='text'>As historian of science [[Simon Schaffer]] writes, it &quot;has been seen as a branch of physics, or chemistry, or natural philosophy, or some highly idiosyncratic version of Priestley's own invention&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, 152</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the volumes were both a scientific and a political enterprise for Priestley, in which he argues that science could destroy &quot;undue and usurped authority&quot; and that government has &quot;reason to tremble even at an air pump or an electrical machine&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Qtd</span>
				<span class='text'>in Kramnick, 11–12; see also Schofield (2004), 121–24</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Volume I of ''Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air'' outlined several discoveries: &quot;nitrous air&quot; ([[nitric oxide]], NO); &quot;vapor of spirit of salt&quot;, later called &quot;acid air&quot; or &quot;marine acid air&quot; ([[anhydrous hydrochloric acid]], HCl); &quot;alkaline air&quot; ([[ammonia]], NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;); &quot;diminished&quot; or &quot;dephlogisticated nitrous air&quot; ([[nitrous oxide]], N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O); and, most famously, &quot;dephlogisticated air&quot; ([[oxygen]], O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as well as experimental findings that showed plants revitalised enclosed volumes of air, a discovery that would eventually lead to the discovery of [[photosynthesis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Priestley also developed a &quot;nitrous air test&quot; to determine the &quot;goodness of air&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Using a [[pneumatic trough]], he would mix nitrous air with a test sample, over water or mercury, and measure the decrease in volume—the principle of [[eudiometer|eudiometry]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Fruton&quot;&gt;Fruton, 20, 29&lt;/ref&gt; After a small history of the study of airs, he explained his own experiments in an open and sincere style</span>
				<span class='text'>As an early biographer writes, &quot;whatever he knows or thinks he tells: doubts, perplexities, blunders are set down with the most refreshing candour</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 98; Thorpe, 171</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Priestley also described his cheap and easy-to-assemble experimental apparatus; his colleagues therefore believed that they could easily reproduce his experiments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (1997), 259–69; Jackson, 110–14; Thorpe, 76–77, 178–79; Uglow, 229–39</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Faced with inconsistent experimental results, Priestley employed phlogiston theory</span>
				<span class='text'>This, however, led him to conclude that there were only three types of &quot;air&quot;: &quot;fixed&quot;, &quot;alkaline&quot;, and &quot;acid&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Priestley dismissed the [[History of chemistry#Early chemists|burgeoning chemistry]] of his day</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, he focused on gases and &quot;changes in their sensible properties&quot;, as had natural philosophers before him</span>
				<span class='text'>He isolated [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), but apparently did not realise that it was a separate &quot;air&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 93–105; Uglow, 240–41; see Gibbs 105–16 for a description of these experiments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Discovery of oxygen===={{see also|Wikisource:The Mouse's Petition}}[[File:Bowood House laboratory</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|The laboratory at Lord Shelburne's  estate - [[Bowood House]], in which Priestley discovered oxygen|alt=Photograph of a laboratory, with glass-encased, wooden bookcases on two walls and a window on the third</span>
				<span class='text'>There is a display case in the middle of the room</span>
				<span class='text'>]In August 1774 he isolated an &quot;air&quot; that appeared to be completely new, but he did not have an opportunity to pursue the matter because he was about to tour Europe with Shelburne</span>
				<span class='text'>While in Paris, however, Priestley managed to replicate the experiment for others, including French chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After returning to Britain in January 1775, he continued his experiments and discovered &quot;vitriolic acid air&quot; ([[sulphur dioxide]], SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)</span>
				<span class='text'>n March he wrote to several people regarding the new &quot;air&quot; that he had discovered in August</span>
				<span class='text'>One of these letters was read aloud to the [[Royal Society]], and a paper outlining the discovery, titled &quot;An Account of further Discoveries in Air&quot;, was published in the Society's journal ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;[http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'' 65 (1775): 384–94</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Priestley called the new substance &quot;dephlogisticated air&quot;, which he made in the famous experiment by [[burning glass|focusing the sun’s rays]] on a sample of [[mercuric oxide]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He first tested it on mice, who surprised him by surviving quite a while entrapped with the air, and then on himself, writing that it was &quot;five or six times better than common air for the purpose of respiration, inflammation, and, I believe, every other use of common atmospherical air&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Qtd</span>
				<span class='text'>in Schofield (2004), 107</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He had discovered [[oxygen]] gas (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Shelburne</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|[[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne]] - like Priestley, a fellow Unitarian - had built a laboratory for the famous dissenter  at [[Bowood House]]</span>
				<span class='text'>alt=Half-length portrait of a man wearing furred robes and a white wig and looking regal</span>
				<span class='text'>Underneath his white robes, he is wearing red and gold and he is sitting in a red chair</span>
				<span class='text'>]Priestley assembled his oxygen paper and several others into a second volume of ''Experiments and Observations on Air'', published in 1776</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not emphasise his discovery of &quot;dephlogisticated air&quot; (leaving it to Part III of the volume) but instead argued in the preface how important such discoveries were to rational religion</span>
				<span class='text'>His paper narrated the discovery chronologically, relating the long delays between experiments and his initial puzzlements; thus, it is difficult to determine when exactly Priestley &quot;discovered&quot; oxygen</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 105–19; see also Jackson, 126–27, 163–64, 166–74; Gibbs, 118–23; Uglow, 229–31, 241; Holt, 93</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Such dating is significant as both Lavoisier and Swedish pharmacist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] have strong claims to the discovery of oxygen as well, Scheele having been the first to isolate the gas (although he published after Priestley) and Lavoisier having been the first to describe it as purified &quot;air itself entire without alteration&quot; (that is, the first to explain oxygen without phlogiston theory)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 53–55</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In his paper &quot;Observations on Respiration and the Use of the Blood&quot;, Priestley was the first to suggest a connection between blood and air, although he did so using [[phlogiston theory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In typical Priestley fashion, he prefaced the paper with a history of the study of respiration</span>
				<span class='text'>A year later, clearly influenced by Priestley, Lavoisier was also discussing respiration at the [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie des sciences]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier's work began the long train of discovery that produced papers on oxygen respiration and culminated in the overthrow of phlogiston theory and the establishment of modern chemistry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 129–30; Gibbs, 124–25</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Around 1779 Priestley and Shelburne had a rupture, the precise reasons for which remain unclear</span>
				<span class='text'>Shelburne blamed Priestley's health, while Priestley claimed Shelburne had no further use for him</span>
				<span class='text'>Some contemporaries speculated that Priestley's outspokenness had hurt Shelburne's political career</span>
				<span class='text'>Schofield argues that the most likely reason was Shelburne's recent marriage to Louisa Fitzpatrick—apparently, she did not like the Priestleys</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Priestley considered moving to America, he eventually accepted [[Birmingham]] New Meeting's offer to be their minister</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 141–43; see also Jackson, 198–99; Holt, 81–82</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Both Priestley and Shelburne's families upheld their Unitarian faith  for generations</span>
				<span class='text'>In December 2013, it was reported that [[Sir Christopher Bullock]] - the direct descendant of Shelburne's brother, [[Thomas Fitzmaurice (MP)]],  had married his wife, [[Lupton family|Lady Bullock]], née Barbara May Lupton, at London's Unitarian [[Essex Street Chapel|Essex Church]] in 1917</span>
				<span class='text'>Barbara Lupton was the second cousin of [[Family of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Olive Middleton]], née Lupton - the great grandmother of [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1914, Olive and Noel  Middleton had married at Leeds' [[Mill Hill Chapel]], which Priestly, as its minister, had once guided towards Unitarianism</span>

				<span class='text'>Priestley accepted the ministerial position at New Meeting on the condition that he be required to preach and teach only on Sundays, so that he would have time for his writing and scientific experiments</span>
				<span class='text'>As in Leeds, Priestley established classes for the youth of his parish and by 1781, he was teaching 150 students</span>
				<span class='text'>Because Priestley's New Meeting salary was only 100 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]], friends and patrons donated money and goods to help continue his investigations</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|One of a set of [[Lunar Society Moonstones]] commemorating Priestley, at [[Great Barr]], Birmingham]]Many of the friends that Priestley made in Birmingham were members of the [[Lunar Society]], a group of manufacturers, inventors, and natural philosophers who assembled monthly to discuss their work</span>
				<span class='text'>The core of the group included men such as the manufacturer [[Matthew Boulton]], the chemist and geologist [[James Keir]], the inventor and engineer [[James Watt]], and the botanist, chemist, and geologist [[William Withering]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Priestley was asked to join this unique society and contributed much to the work of its members</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this stimulating intellectual environment, he published several important scientific papers, including &quot;Experiments relating to Phlogiston, and the seeming Conversion of Water into Air&quot; (1783)</span>
				<span class='text'>The first part attempts to refute Lavoisier's challenges to his work on oxygen; the second part describes how steam is &quot;converted&quot; into air</span>

				<span class='text'>in Schofield (2004), 167&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery, along with his earlier work on what would later be recognised as gaseous diffusion&lt;!-- [[gaseous diffusion]] page seems like an incorrect link --&gt;, would eventually lead [[John Dalton]] and [[Thomas Graham (chemist)|Thomas Graham]] to formulate the [[kinetic theory of gases]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; it was against these attacks that Priestley responded in 1783</span>
				<span class='text'>While Priestley accepted parts of Lavoisier's theory, he was unprepared to assent to the major revolutions Lavoisier proposed: the overthrow of phlogiston, a chemistry based conceptually on [[Chemical element|elements]] and [[Chemical compound|compounds]], and a new [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry nomenclature|chemical nomenclature]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Priestley's original experiments on &quot;dephlogisticated air&quot; (oxygen), combustion, and water provided Lavoisier with the data he needed to construct much of his system; yet Priestley never accepted Lavoisier's new theories and continued to defend phlogiston theory for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Lavoisier's system was based largely on the ''quantitative'' concept that [[mass]] is neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> the [[law of conservation of mass|conservation of mass]])</span>
				<span class='text'>By contrast, Priestley preferred to observe ''qualitative'' changes in heat, color, and particularly volume</span>
				<span class='text'>His experiments tested &quot;airs&quot; for &quot;their solubility in water, their power of supporting or extinguishing flame, whether they were respirable, how they behaved with acid and alkaline air, and with nitric oxide and inflammable air, and lastly how they were affected by the [[electric spark]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, 210; see also Schofield (2004), 169–94; Jackson 216–24</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;By 1789, when Lavoisier published his ''[[Traité Élémentaire de Chimie]]'' and founded the ''[[Annales de Chimie]]'', the new chemistry had come into its own</span>
				<span class='text'>Priestley published several more scientific papers in Birmingham, the majority attempting to refute Lavoisier</span>
				<span class='text'>Priestley and other Lunar Society members argued that the new French system was too expensive, too difficult to test, and unnecessarily complex</span>
				<span class='text'>Priestley in particular rejected its &quot;establishment&quot; aura</span>
				<span class='text'>In the end, Lavoisier's view prevailed: his new chemistry introduced many of the principles on which [[chemistry|modern chemistry]] is founded</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, 164; Uglow, 356; McEvoy (1983), 56–57; Donovan, 175–76, 180–81</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Priestley's refusal to accept Lavoisier's &quot;new chemistry&quot;—such as the [[law of conservation of mass|conservation of mass]]—and his determination to adhere to a less satisfactory theory has perplexed many scholars</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See Schaffer, 162–70 for a historiographical analysis</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Schofield explains it thus: &quot;Priestley was never a chemist; in a modern, and even a Lavoisierian, sense, he was never a scientist</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a natural philosopher, concerned with the economy of nature and obsessed with an idea of unity, in theology and in nature</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 194</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Historian of science John McEvoy largely agrees, writing that Priestley's view of nature as coextensive with God and thus infinite, which encouraged him to focus on facts over hypotheses and theories, prompted him to reject Lavoisier's system</span>

				<span class='text'>Burke, in his famous ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), tied natural philosophers, and specifically Priestley, to the French Revolution, writing that radicals who supported science in Britain &quot;considered man in their experiments no more than they do mice in an air pump&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>He made much in his later writings of the connections between &quot;Gunpowder Joe&quot;, science, and Lavoisier—who was improving gunpowder for the French in their [[French Revolutionary Wars|war against Britain]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Crossland, 283–87, 305</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Paradoxically, a secular statesman, Burke, argued against science and maintained that religion should be the basis of civil society, whereas a Dissenting minister, Priestley, argued that religion could not provide the basis for civil society and should be restricted to one's private life</span>

				<span class='text'>ince his arrival in America, Priestley had continued to defend his [[Unitarianism|Christian Unitarian]] beliefs; now, falling increasingly under the influence of [[Thomas Cooper (U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>politician)|Thomas Cooper]] and Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley, he was unable to avoid becoming embroiled in political controversy</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1798, when, in response to the [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney|Pinckney affair]], a belligerent [[John Adams|President Adams]] sought to enlarge the navy and mobilise the militia into what Priestley and [[Thomas Cooper (U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>politician)|Cooper]] saw as a 'standing army', Priestley published an anonymous newspaper article: ''Maxims of political arithmetic'', which attacked [[John Adams|Adams]], defended free trade, and advocated a form of Jeffersonian isolationism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Signed ‘A Quaker in politics,’ the ''Maxims'' were printed over two days in the ''Aurora General Advertiser'', 26 &amp; 27 February 1798, and reprinted in both the ''Aurora''and ''Carey's United States' Recorder'', 31 March &amp; 1 April 1799</span>
				<span class='text'>See Rutt, XXV, 175-82</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, a small package, addressed vaguely: &quot;Dr Priestley in America,&quot; was seized by the [[Royal Navy]] on board a neutral Danish boat</span>
				<span class='text'>It was found to contain three letters, one of which was signed by the radical printer [[John Hurford Stone]]</span>
				<span class='text'>These intercepted letters were published in London, and copied in numerous papers in America</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Copies of original letters recently written by persons in Paris to Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Priestley in America, taken on board of a neutral vessel'' (London, 1798)</span>
				<span class='text'>''Federal Gazette'' (Baltimore, MD), 27 August 1798</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; One of the letters was addressed to &quot;MBP&quot;, with a note: &quot;I inclose a note for our friend MBP—but, as ignorant of the name he bears at present among you, I must beg you to seal and address it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This gave the intercepted letters a tinge of intrigue</span>
				<span class='text'>Fearful lest they be taken as evidence of him being a 'spy in the interest of France', Priestley sent a clumsy letter to numerous newspaper editors, in which he naively named &quot;MBP&quot; (Member of the British Parliament) as [[Benjamin Vaughan|Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Benjamin Vaughan]], who &quot;like me, thought it necessary to leave England, and for some time is said to have assumed a feigned name</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan had fled to France in May 1794, when [[John Hurford Stone]]'s brother, William, was arrested and found to have a letter from Vaughan</span>

				<span class='text'>When, a while later, Priestley's household suffered a bout of food poisoning, perhaps from [[Milk sickness|puking sickness]] or a [[Pathogenic bacteria|bacterial infection]], Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley, falsely accused [[William Priestley (Louisiana planter)|William]] of having poisoned the family's flour</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 151–52</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The 19th-century French naturalist [[George Cuvier]], in his eulogy of Priestley, praised his discoveries while at the same time lamenting his refusal to abandon phlogiston theory, calling him &quot;the father of modern chemistry [who] never acknowledged his daughter&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>in McLachlan (1987–90), 259–60</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Priestley published more than 150 works on topics ranging from political philosophy to education to theology to natural philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, 74; Kramnick, 4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He led and inspired British radicals during the 1790s, paved the way for [[utilitarianism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Tapper, 322&quot;&gt;Tapper, 322</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A wide variety of philosophers, scientists, and poets became [[Association of Ideas|associationists]] as a result of his [[redaction]] of David Hartley's ''[[Observations on Man]]'', including [[Erasmus Darwin]], Coleridge, [[William Wordsworth]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Alexander Bain]], and [[Herbert Spencer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schofield (2004), 52–57; Holt, 111–12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] praised Priestley in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781), writing that he &quot;knew how to combine his paradoxical teaching with the interests of religion&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Tap314/&gt; Indeed, it was Priestley's aim to &quot;put the most 'advanced' Enlightenment ideas into the service of a rationalized though heterodox Christianity, under the guidance of the basic principles of scientific method&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Tapper, 322&quot;/&gt;Considering the extent of Priestley's influence, relatively little scholarship has been devoted to him</span>
				<span class='text'>In the early 20th century, Priestley was most often described as a conservative and dogmatic scientist who was nevertheless a political and religious reformer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McEvoy (1983), 47</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In a historiographic review essay, historian of science [[Simon Schaffer]] describes the two dominant portraits of Priestley: the first depicts him as &quot;a playful innocent&quot; who stumbled across his discoveries; the second portrays him as innocent as well as &quot;warped&quot; for not understanding their implications better</span>
				<span class='text'>Assessing Priestley's works as a totality has been difficult for scholars because of his wide-ranging interests</span>
				<span class='text'>His scientific discoveries have usually been divorced from his theological and metaphysical publications to make an analysis of his life and writings easier, but this approach has been challenged recently by scholars such as John McEvoy and Robert Schofield</span>
				<span class='text'>Although early Priestley scholarship claimed that his theological and metaphysical works were &quot;distractions&quot; and &quot;obstacles&quot; to his scientific work, scholarship published in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s maintained that Priestley's works constituted a unified theory</span>
				<span class='text'>However, as Schaffer explains, no convincing synthesis of his work has yet been expounded</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, 154–57</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in 2001, historian of science Dan Eshet has argued that efforts to create a &quot;synoptic view&quot; have resulted only in a rationalisation of the contradictions in Priestley's thought, because they have been &quot;organized around philosophical categories&quot; and have &quot;separate[d] the producers of scientific ideas from any social conflict&quot;</span>
