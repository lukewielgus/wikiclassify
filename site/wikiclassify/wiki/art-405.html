				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=41, 225-9}} The popular legend that he attempted the ancient methods of flame gazing, water gazing or both simultaneously is based on a naive reading of his first two verses, which merely liken his efforts to those of the [[Oracle of Delphi|Delphic]] and [[Didyma|Branchidic]] [[oracle]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>The first of these is reproduced at the bottom of this article and the second can be seen by visiting the relevant facsimile site (see External Links)</span>
				<span class='text'>In his dedication to King Henri II, Nostradamus describes &quot;emptying my soul, mind and heart of all care, worry and unease through mental calm and tranquility&quot;, but his frequent references to the &quot;bronze tripod&quot; of the [[Delphi]]c rite are usually preceded by the words &quot;as though&quot; (compare, once again, External References to the original texts)</span>
				<span class='text'>=Interpretations==Most of the quatrains deal with disasters, such as plagues, earthquakes, wars, floods, invasions, murders, droughts, and battles‚Äîall undated and based on foreshadowings by the ''[[Mirabilis Liber]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Some quatrains cover these disasters in overall terms; others concern a single person or small group of people</span>
				<span class='text'>Some cover a single town, others several towns in several countries</span>
				<span class='text'>A major, underlying theme is an impending invasion of Europe by Muslim forces from farther east and south headed by the expected [[Antichrist]], directly reflecting the then-current Ottoman invasions and the earlier [[Saracen]] equivalents, as well as the prior expectations of the ''Mirabilis Liber''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=xii-xviii}} All of this is presented in the context of the supposedly imminent end of the world‚Äîeven though this is not in fact mentioned&lt;ref&gt;Nostradamus, M</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Les Propheties'', 1568 omnibus edition&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîa conviction that sparked numerous collections of [[eschatology|end-time prophecies]] at the time, including an unpublished collection by [[Christopher Columbus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Watts|1985|p=73-102}}Nostradamus has been credited, for the most part in hindsight, with predicting numerous events in world history, from the [[Great Fire of London]], and the rise of [[Napoleon]] and [[Adolf Hitler]], to the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973‚Äì2001)|World Trade Center]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gruber|2003}} In 1992 one commentator who claimed to be able to contact Nostradamus under hypnosis even had him 'interpreting' his own verse X</span>
				<span class='text'> (a prediction specifically about floods in southern France around the city of N√Æmes and people taking refuge in its ''collosse'', or Colosseum, a Roman amphitheatre now known as the ''Ar√®nes'') as a prediction of an undated ''attack on the Pentagon'', despite the historical seer's clear statement in his dedicatory letter to King Henri II that his prophecies were about Europe, North Africa and part of Asia Minor</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=145}} Skeptics such as [[James Randi]] suggest that his reputation as a prophet is largely manufactured by modern-day supporters who fit his words to events that have either already occurred or are so imminent as to be inevitable, a process sometimes known as &quot;retroactive clairvoyance&quot; ([[postdiction]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, no Nostradamus quatrain is known to have been interpreted as predicting a specific event before it occurred, other than in vague, general terms that could equally apply to any number of other events</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=23}}  This even applies to quatrains that contain specific dates, such as III</span>
				<span class='text'>7, which predicts &quot;in 1727, in October, the king of Persia [shall be] captured by those of Egypt&quot;‚Äîa prophecy that has, as ever, been interpreted retrospectively in the light of later events, in this case as though it presaged the known ''peace treaty'' between the Ottoman Empire and Persia of that year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Cheetham, Erika, ''The Final Prophecies of Nostradamus'', Futura, 1990, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>08-9&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Nostradamus's notorious '1999' prophecy at X</span>
				<span class='text'>2 (see [[Nostradamus in popular culture]]) describes no event that commentators have succeeded in identifying either before or since, other than by dint of twisting the words to fit whichever of the many contradictory happenings they are keen to claim as 'hits'</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=21-2}} Moreover, no quatrain suggests, as is often claimed by books and films on the alleged [[2012 phenomenon|Mayan Prophecy]], that the world would end in December 2012</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=41}}   In his preface to the ''Prophecies'', Nostradamus himself stated that his prophecies extend 'from now to the year 3797'{{sfn|Nostradamus|1555|loc=Preface}}‚Äîan extraordinary date which, given that the preface was written in 1555, may have more than a little to do with the fact that 2242 (3797&amp;nbsp;‚àí&amp;nbsp;1555) had recently been proposed by his major astrological source [[Richard Roussat]] as a possible date for the end of the world</span>

				<span class='text'>At one end of the spectrum, there are extreme academic views such as those of [[Jacques Halbronn]], who has suggested at great length and with great complexity that Nostradamus's ''Prophecies'' are antedated forgeries written by later hands with a political axe to grind</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See his many papers in Benazra's academic forum at http://ramkat</span>

				<span class='text'>r/analyse</span>
				<span class='text'>tml&lt;/ref&gt; No other major source accepts this view [see reference-list]</span>
				<span class='text'>t the other end of the spectrum, there are numerous fairly recent popular books, and thousands of private websites, suggesting not only that the ''Prophecies'' are genuine but that Nostradamus was a true prophet</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to the subjective nature of these interpretations, however, no two of them agree on exactly what he predicted, whether for the past or for the future</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=144-8}} Many of these do agree, though, that particular predictions refer, for example, to the [[French Revolution]], [[Napoleon]], [[Adolf Hitler]],{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=36}}{{Efn|In several quatrains he mentions the name ''Hister'' (somewhat resembling ''Hitler''), although this is the classical name for the Lower Danube, as he himself explains in his ''Presage'' for 1554</span>

				<span class='text'>There is also an evident consensus among popular authors that he predicted whatever major event had just happened at the time of each book's publication, from the [[Apollo moon landings]], through the [[Diana, Princess of Wales#Death|death of Diana, Princess of Wales]] in 1997, and the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]] in 1986,&lt;ref name=&quot;chal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=144-8}}Possibly the first of these books to become popular in English was [[Henry C</span>
				<span class='text'>Roberts]]' ''The Complete Prophecies of Nostradamus'' of 1947, reprinted at least seven times during the next forty years, which contained both transcriptions and translations, with brief commentaries</span>
				<span class='text'>This was followed in 1961 (reprinted in 1982) by Edgar Leoni's ''Nostradamus and His Prophecies''</span>
				<span class='text'>After that came [[Erika Cheetham]]'s ''The Prophecies of Nostradamus'', incorporating a reprint of the posthumous 1568 edition, which was reprinted, revised and republished several times from 1973 onwards, latterly as ''The Final Prophecies of Nostradamus''</span>
				<span class='text'>This served as the basis for the documentary ''[[The Man Who Saw Tomorrow]]'' and both did indeed mention possible generalised future attacks on New York (via [[nuclear weapon]]s), though not specifically on the World Trade Center or on any particular date</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Cheetham, Erika, ''The Final Prophecies of Nostradamus'', Futura, 1990, p</span>
				<span class='text'>73&lt;/ref&gt; A two-part translation of Jean-Charles de Fontbrune's ''Nostradamus: historien et proph√®te'' was published in 1980, and John Hogue has published a number of books on Nostradamus from about 1987 including ''Nostradamus and the Millenium: Predictions of the Future'', ''Nostradamus: The Complete Prophecies'' (1999) and ''Nostradamus: A Life and Myth'' (2003)</span>
				<span class='text'>ith the exception of Roberts, these books and their many popular imitators were almost unanimous not merely about Nostradamus's powers of prophecy, but also about various aspects of his biography</span>

				<span class='text'>He is credited with having successfully cured the [[Bubonic plague|Plague]] at [[Aix-en-Provence]] and elsewhere; he had engaged in [[scrying]], using either a magic mirror or a bowl of water; he had been joined by his secretary Chavigny at Easter 1554; having published the first installment of his ''Propheties'', he had been summoned by Queen [[Catherine de' Medici]] to Paris in 1556 to discuss with her his prophecy at quatrain I</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=26-45}}Curiously, this particular story seems to have been first recorded by [[Samuel Pepys]] ''as early as 1667'', long before the [[French Revolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Pepys records in his celebrated [[Diary of Samuel Pepys|diary]] a legend that, before his death, Nostradamus made the townsfolk swear that his grave would never be disturbed; but that 60 years later his body was exhumed, whereupon a brass plaque was found on his chest correctly stating the date and time when his grave would be opened and cursing the exhumers</span>

				<span class='text'>The publication in 1983 of Nostradamus's private correspondence{{Sfn|Dup√®be|1983}} and, during succeeding years, of the original editions of 1555 and 1557 discovered by Chomarat and Benazra, together with the unearthing of much original archival material{{sfn|Leroy|1993}}{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993}} revealed that much that was claimed about Nostradamus did not fit the documented facts</span>
				<span class='text'>The academics{{sfn|Leroy|1993}}{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=26-45}}{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993}}{{sfn|Randi|1990}} revealed that ''not one'' of the claims just listed was backed up by any known contemporary documentary evidence</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of them had evidently been based on unsourced rumours relayed as fact by much later commentators, such as Jaubert (1656), Guynaud (1693) and Bareste (1840), on modern misunderstandings of the 16th-century French texts, or on pure invention</span>
				<span class='text'>Even the often-advanced suggestion that quatrain I</span>
				<span class='text'>5 had successfully prophesied King Henri II's death did not actually appear in print for the first time until 1614, 55 years after the event</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=28-30}}{{sfn|Brind'Amour|1993|p=267}}Additionally, the academics,{{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=144}}{{sfn|Randi|1990}}{{sfn|Wilson|2003}} who themselves tend to eschew any attempt at interpretation, complained that the English translations were usually of poor quality, seemed to display little or no knowledge of 16th-century French, were tendentious and, at worst, were sometimes twisted to fit the events to which they were supposed to refer (or vice versa)</span>
				<span class='text'>None of them were based on the original editions: Roberts had based his writings on that of 1672, Cheetham and Hogue on the posthumous edition of 1568</span>
				<span class='text'>Even Leoni accepted on page 115 that he had never seen an original edition, and on earlier pages he indicated that much of his biographical material was unsourced</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leoni|1961|p=115}}However, none of this research and criticism was originally known to most of the English-language commentators, by function of the dates when they were writing and, to some extent, of the language in which it was written</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lemesurier|2010|p=144-8}} Hogue was in a position to take advantage of it, but it was only in 2003 that he accepted that some of his earlier biographical material had in fact been apocryphal</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, some of the more recent sources listed (Lemesurier, Gruber, Wilson) have been particularly scathing about later attempts by some lesser-known authors and Internet enthusiasts to extract alleged hidden meanings from the texts, whether with the aid of anagrams, numerical codes, graphs or otherwise</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Lemesurier|2003|p=144-8}}==In popular culture=={{Main|Nostradamus in popular culture}}The prophecies retold and expanded by Nostradamus  figured largely in [[popular culture]] in the 20th and 21st centuries</span>
