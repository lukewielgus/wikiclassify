				<span class='text'>vg}}'''Robert Edward Lee''' (January 19, 1807&amp;nbsp;â€“ October 12, 1870) was an American soldier known for commanding the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Army of Northern Virginia]] in the [[American Civil War]] from 1862 until his surrender in 1865</span>
				<span class='text'>The son of [[American Revolution|Revolutionary War]] officer [[Henry Lee III|Henry &quot;Light Horse Harry&quot; Lee III]], Lee was a top graduate of the [[United States Military Academy]] and an exceptional officer and [[military engineer]] in the [[United States Army]] for 32 years</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time, he served throughout the United States, distinguished himself during the [[Mexicanâ€“American War]], served as Superintendent of the United States Military Academy, and married [[Mary Anna Custis Lee|Mary Custis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Virginia declared its secession from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in April 1861, Lee chose to follow his home state, despite his personal desire for the country to remain intact and despite an offer of a senior Union command</span>

				<span class='text'>After being thoroughly outmaneuvered, Lee surrendered his entire army to Grant at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox Court House]] on April 9, 1865</span>
				<span class='text'>By this time, Lee had assumed supreme command of the remaining Southern armies; other Confederate forces swiftly capitulated after his surrender</span>
				<span class='text'>Lee rejected the proposal of a sustained insurgency against the Union and called for reconciliation between the two sides</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the war, as President of what is now [[Washington and Lee University]], Lee supported President [[Andrew Johnson]]'s program of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and intersectional friendship, while opposing the [[Radical Republicans|Radical Republican]] proposals to give freed slaves the vote and take the vote away from ex-Confederates</span>
				<span class='text'>He urged them to rethink their position between the North and the South, and the reintegration of former Confederates into the nation's political life</span>
				<span class='text'>Lee became the great Southern hero of the War, a postwar icon of the &quot;[[Lost Cause of the Confederacy]]&quot; to some</span>
				<span class='text'>But his popularity grew even in the North, especially after his death in 1870</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|pp=30â€“31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1811, the family, including the newly born sixth child, Mildred, moved to a house on Oronoco Street, still close to the center of town and with the houses of a number of Lee relatives close by</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|pp=38â€“45}}&lt;/ref&gt;Anne Lee's family was often supported by a relative, [[William Henry Fitzhugh]], who owned the Oronoco Street house and allowed the Lees to stay at his home in [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], [[Ravensworth (plantation)|Ravensworth]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Army]]On August 11, 1829, Brigadier General [[Charles Gratiot]] ordered Lee to [[Cockspur Island]], [[Georgia (U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>state)|Georgia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The plan was to build a fort on the marshy island which would command the outlet of the [[Savannah River]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Lee was involved in the early stages of construction as the island was being drained and built up</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|pp=57â€“58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1831, it became apparent that the existing plan to build what became known as [[Fort Pulaski]] would have to be revamped, and Lee was transferred to [[Fort Monroe]] at the tip of the [[Virginia Peninsula]] (today in [[Hampton, Virginia]])</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;bunker&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1997|pp=25â€“26}}&lt;/ref&gt;While home in the summer of 1829, Lee had apparently courted [[Mary Anna Custis Lee|Mary Custis]] whom he had known as a child</span>
				<span class='text'>Lee obtained permission to write to her before leaving for Georgia, though Mary Custis warned Lee to be &quot;discreet&quot; in his writing, as her mother read her letters, especially from men</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Custis refused Lee the first time he asked to marry her; her father did not believe the son of the disgraced Light Horse Harry Lee was a suitable man for his daughter</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; She accepted him with her father's consent in September 1830, while he was on summer leave,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|pp=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two were wed on June 30, 1831</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|pp=64â€“65}}&lt;/ref&gt;Lee's duties at Fort Monroe were varied, typical for a junior officer, and ranged from budgeting to designing buildings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1997|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Mary Lee accompanied her husband to [[Hampton Roads]], she spent about a third of her time at Arlington, though the couple's first son, [[George Washington Custis Lee|Custis Lee]] was born at Fort Monroe</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the two were by all accounts devoted to each other, they were different in character: Robert Lee was tidy and punctual, qualities his wife lacked</span>
				<span class='text'>Mary Lee also had trouble transitioning from being a rich man's daughter to having to manage a household with only one or two slaves</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fellman|2000|pp=24â€“25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1832, Robert Lee had a close but platonic relationship with Harriett Talcott, wife of his fellow officer [[Andrew Talcott]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 1834, Lee was transferred to Washington as General Gratiot's assistant</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1995|pp=74â€“75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee had hoped to rent a house in Washington for his family, but was not able to find one; the family lived at Arlington, though Lieutenant Lee rented a room at a Washington boarding house for when the roads were impassable</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freeman|1997|pp=33â€“34}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1835, Lee was assigned to assist Andrew Talcott in surveying the southern border of Michigan</span>

				<span class='text'>Freeman]] described them as &quot;Lee's first experience with the extravagance of irresponsible antislavery agitators&quot; and asserted that &quot;There is no evidence, direct or indirect, that Lee ever had them or any other Negroes flogged</span>

				<span class='text'>In the period following the war, Lee became a central figure in the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] interpretation of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>The argument that Lee had always somehow opposed slavery helped maintain his stature as a symbol of Southern honor and national reconciliation</span>
				<span class='text'>Freeman's analysis places Lee's attitude toward slavery and abolition in a historical context:{{quote|This [opinion] was the prevailing view among most religious people of Lee's class in the border states</span>
				<span class='text'>They believed that slavery existed because God willed it and they thought it would end when God so ruled</span>
				<span class='text'>The time and the means were not theirs to decide, conscious though they were of the ill-effects of Negro slavery on both races</span>
				<span class='text'>Lee shared these convictions of his neighbors without having come in contact with the worst evils of African bondage</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent no considerable time in any state south of Virginia from the day he left Fort Pulaski in 1831 until he went to Texas in 1856</span>
				<span class='text'>All his reflective years had been passed in the North or in the border states</span>
				<span class='text'>He had never been among the blacks on a cotton or rice plantation</span>
				<span class='text'>At Arlington, the servants had been notoriously indolent, their master's master</span>
				<span class='text'>Lee, in short, was only acquainted with slavery at its best, and he judged it accordingly</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, he was under no illusion regarding the aims of the Abolitionists or the effect of their agitation</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the face of the Union superiority in naval, artillery and infantry deployment, Lee was able to block any Federal advance on Savannah, and at the same time, well-trained Georgia troops were released in time to meet McClellan's Peninsula Campaign</span>
