				<span class='text'> Although the exact dates of his dominance are a matter of scholarly debate, 1721–1742 are often used</span>
				<span class='text'>He dominated the [[Walpole–Townshend Ministry]] and the [[Walpole Ministry|Ministry]] and holds the record as the [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom by tenure|longest serving Prime Minister in British history]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Critics called his system the &quot;Robinocracy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Speck says that Walpole's uninterrupted run of 20 years as Prime Minister &quot;is rightly regarded as one of the major feats of British political history</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Explanations are usually offered in terms of his expert handling of the political system after 1720, [and] his unique blending of the surviving powers of the crown with the increasing influence of the Commons</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;W</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Speck, ''Stability and Strife: England 1714–1760'' (1977) p 203&lt;/ref&gt;He was a [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] from the gentry class, who was first elected to parliament in 1701, and held many senior positions</span>
				<span class='text'> He was a country squire and looked to country gentlemen for his political base</span>
				<span class='text'>Historian Frank O'Gorman says his leadership in Parliament reflected his &quot;reasonable and persuasive oratory, his ability to move both the emotions as well as the minds of men, and, above all, his extraordinary self-confidence</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Frank O'Gorman, ''The Long Eighteenth Century: British Political and Social History 1688–1832'' (1997) p 71&lt;/ref&gt; Hoppit says Walpole's policies sought moderation: he worked for peace, lower taxes, growing exports, and allowed a little more tolerance for Protestant Dissenters</span>
				<span class='text'> He avoided controversy and high-intensity disputes, as his middle way attracted moderates from both the Whig and Tory camps</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?  England 1689–1727'' (2000) p 410&lt;/ref&gt;Dickinson sums up his historical role:: Walpole was one of the greatest politicians in British history</span>
				<span class='text'> He played a significant role in sustaining the Whig party, safeguarding the Hanoverian succession, and defending the principles of the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688)</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>He established a stable political supremacy for the Whig party and taught succeeding ministers how best to establish an effective working relationship between Crown and Parliament</span>

				<span class='text'>Dickinson, &quot;Walpole, Sir Robert,&quot; in David Loads, editor, ''Readers Guide to British History'' (2003) p 1338&lt;/ref&gt;==Early life==Walpole was born in [[Houghton, Norfolk|Houghton]], [[Norfolk]], in 1676</span>
				<span class='text'>One of 19 children, he was the third son and fifth child of [[Robert Walpole (1650–1700)|Robert Walpole]], a member of the local gentry and a Whig politician who represented the borough of [[Castle Rising]] in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], and his wife Mary Walpole, the daughter and heiress of Sir Geoffrey Burwell of [[Rougham, Suffolk]]</span>
				<span class='text'> [[Horatio Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole]] was his younger brother</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|pp=178–179}}==Education==As a child, Walpole attended a private school at [[Great Massingham|Massingham, Norfolk]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=179}} Walpole entered [[Eton College]] in 1690{{sfn|ACAD|WLPL695R}} where he was considered &quot;an excellent scholar&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He left Eton on 2 April 1696{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=179}} and matriculated at [[King's College, Cambridge]] on the same day</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|ACAD|WLPL695R}} On 25 May 1698 he left Cambridge after the death of his only remaining elder brother, Edward, so that he could help his father administer the family estate to which he had become the heir</span>
				<span class='text'>Walpole had planned to become a clergyman but as he was now the eldest surviving son in the family, he abandoned the idea</span>
				<span class='text'>In November 1700 his father died, and Walpole succeeded to the estate</span>
				<span class='text'>A paper in his father's handwriting, dated 9 June 1700, shows the family estate in Norfolk and Suffolk to have been nine manors in Norfolk and one in Suffolk</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180}}==Early political career==Walpole's political career began in January 1701 when he won a seat in the general election at [[Castle Rising (UK Parliament constituency)|Castle Rising]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He left Castle Rising in 1702 so that he could represent the neighbouring borough of [[King's Lynn (UK Parliament constituency)|King's Lynn]], a [[pocket borough]] that would re-elect him for the remainder of his political career</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180}}Like his father, Robert Walpole was a member of the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=180, 181}} In 1705, Walpole was appointed by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] to be a member of the council for her husband, [[Prince George of Denmark]], [[Admiralty|Lord High Admiral]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After having been singled out in a struggle between the Whigs and the government, Walpole became the intermediary for reconciling the government to the Whig leaders</span>
				<span class='text'>His abilities were recognised by [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Lord Godolphin]] (the [[Lord High Treasurer]] and leader of the Cabinet) and he was subsequently appointed to the position of [[Secretary at War]] in 1708; for a short period of time in 1710 he also simultaneously held the post of [[Treasurer of the Navy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|pp=181–82}}Despite his personal clout, however, Walpole could not stop Lord Godolphin and the Whigs from pressing for the prosecution of [[Henry Sacheverell]], a minister who preached anti-Whig sermons</span>
				<span class='text'>The trial was extremely unpopular with much of the country, causing the [[Sacheverell riots]], and was followed by the downfall of the Duke of Marlborough and the Whig Party in the general election of 1710</span>
				<span class='text'>The new ministry, under the leadership of the Tory [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Robert Harley]], removed Walpole from his office of Secretary at War but he remained Treasurer of the Navy until 2 January 1711</span>
				<span class='text'>  Harley had first attempted to entice him and then threatened him to join the Tories, but Walpole rejected the offers, instead becoming one of the most outspoken members of the Whig Opposition</span>
				<span class='text'> He effectively defended Lord Godolphin against Tory attacks in parliamentary debate, as well as in the press</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Speck, ''Stability and Strife: England 1714–1760'' (1977) pp 206–9&lt;/ref&gt;In 1712, Walpole was accused of [[venality]] and corruption in the matter of two forage contracts for Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>Although it was proven that he had retained none of the money, Walpole was pronounced &quot;guilty of a high breach of trust and notorious corruption&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=183}} He was impeached by the House of Commons and found guilty by the [[House of Lords]]; he was then imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] for six months and expelled from Parliament</span>
				<span class='text'>While in the Tower he was regarded as a political martyr, and visited by all the Whig leaders</span>
				<span class='text'>After he was released, Walpole wrote and published anonymous pamphlets attacking the Harley ministry and assisted Sir [[Richard Steele]] in crafting political pamphlets</span>
				<span class='text'>Walpole was re-elected for King's Lynn in 1713</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=183}}==Stanhope–Sunderland Ministry==[[Image:Robert Walpole prime minister of Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|upright|thumb|Sir Robert Walpole]]Queen Anne died in 1714</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which excluded Roman Catholics from the line of succession, Anne was  succeeded by a distant German cousin, [[George I of Great Britain|George I]]</span>
				<span class='text'>George I distrusted the Tories, whom he believed opposed his right to succeed to the Throne</span>
				<span class='text'>The year of George's accession, 1714, marked the ascendancy of the Whigs who would remain in power for the next fifty years</span>
				<span class='text'>Robert Walpole became a [[Privy Council of Great Britain|Privy Councillor]] and rose to the position of [[Paymaster of the Forces]]{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=184}} in a Cabinet nominally led by [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], but actually dominated by [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Lord Townshend]] (Walpole's brother-in-law) and [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|James Stanhope]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Walpole was also appointed chairman of a secret committee formed to investigate the actions of the previous Tory ministry in 1715</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=184}}Lord Halifax, the titular head of the administration, died in 1715</span>
				<span class='text'>Walpole was appointed to the posts of [[First Lord of the Treasury]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]; in this position, he introduced the [[sinking fund]], a device to reduce the national debt</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leadam|1899|pp=184, 186}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Cabinet of which he was a member was often divided over most important issues</span>
				<span class='text'>Normally, Walpole and Lord Townshend were on one side, with Stanhope and [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] on the other</span>
				<span class='text'>Foreign policy was the primary issue of contention; George I was thought to be conducting foreign affairs with the interests of his German territories, rather than those of Great Britain, at heart</span>
				<span class='text'>The Stanhope–Sunderland faction, however, had the King's support</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1716 Townshend was removed from the important post of [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department|Northern Secretary]] and put in the lesser office of [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=185}} Even this change did not appease Stanhope and Sunderland who secured the dismissal of Townshend from the Lord-Lieutenancy in April 1717</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=185}} On the next day, Walpole resigned from the Cabinet to join the Opposition &quot;because I could not connive at some things that were carrying on&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leadam|1899|p=185}} cites ''Parl</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  In the new Cabinet, Sunderland and Stanhope (who was created an Earl) were the effective heads</span>
				<span class='text'>oon after Walpole's resignation, a bitter family quarrel between the King and the [[George II of Great Britain|Prince of Wales]] split the Royal Family</span>
				<span class='text'>Walpole and others who opposed the Government often congregated at [[Leicester Square#History|Leicester House]], the home of the Prince of Wales, to form political plans</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Walpole also became an adviser and close friend of the Prince of Wales's wife, [[Caroline of Ansbach|Caroline]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=187}} In 1720 he improved his position by bringing about a reconciliation between the Prince of Wales and the King</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2013}}Walpole continued to be an influential figure in the House of Commons</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=June 2013}} He was especially active in opposing one of the Government's more significant proposals, the [[Peerage Bill]], which would have limited the power of the monarch to create new [[peerage]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=186}} Walpole brought about a temporary abandonment of the bill in 1719{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} and the outright rejection of the bill by the House of Commons</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=187}} This defeat led Lord Stanhope and Lord Sunderland to reconcile with their opponents;{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Walpole returned as Paymaster of the Forces{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=187}} and Townshend was appointed [[Lord President of the Council]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By accepting the position of Paymaster, however, Walpole lost the favour of the Prince of Wales (the future King George II) who still harboured disdain for his father's Government</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2013}}==Rise to power==Soon after Walpole returned to the Cabinet, Britain was swept by a wave of over-enthusiastic speculation which led to the [[South Sea Bubble]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=187}} The Government had established a plan whereby the South Sea Company would assume the national debt of Great Britain in exchange for lucrative bonds</span>
				<span class='text'>It was widely believed that the Company would eventually reap an enormous profit through international trade in cloth, agricultural goods, and [[slave trade|slaves]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Many in the country, including Walpole himself (who sold at the top of the market and made 1,000 percent profit), frenziedly invested in the company</span>
				<span class='text'>By the latter part of 1720, however, the company had begun to collapse as the price of its shares plunged</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2013}}</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=187}}In 1721 a committee investigated{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} the scandal, finding that there was corruption on the part of many in the Cabinet</span>
				<span class='text'>Among those implicated were [[John Aislabie]]{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=187}} (the Chancellor of the Exchequer), [[James Craggs the Elder]] (the [[Postmaster General]]), [[James Craggs the Younger]] (the [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department|Southern Secretary]]), and even Lords Stanhope and Sunderland (the heads of the Ministry)</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Craggs the Elder and Craggs the Younger died in disgrace; the remainder were impeached for their corruption</span>
				<span class='text'>Aislabie was found guilty and imprisoned, but the personal influence of Walpole saved both Stanhope and Sunderland</span>
				<span class='text'>For his role in preventing these individuals and others from being punished,{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Walpole gained the nickname of &quot;The Screen&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leadam|1899|p=187}} cites Coxe, ii</span>

				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2013}}The resignation of Sunderland and the death of Stanhope in 1721 left Walpole as the most important figure in the administration</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2013}} In April 1721 he was appointed First Lord of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Walpole's ''de facto'' tenure as &quot;Prime Minister&quot; is often dated to his appointment as First Lord of the Treasury in 1721</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=187}} His brother-in-law Lord Townshend, served as Secretary of State{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} for the Northern Department and controlled the nation's foreign affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>The two also had to contend with the Secretary of State for the Southern Department, [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Carteret]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Townshend and Walpole were thus restored to power and &quot;annihilated the opposing faction&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=187}}==Premiership under George I==Under the guidance of Walpole, [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] attempted to deal with the financial crisis brought on by the [[South Sea Bubble]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The estates of the directors of the [[South Sea Company]] were used to relieve the suffering of the victims, and the stock of the company was divided between the [[Bank of England]] and [[East India Company]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=187}} The crisis had significantly damaged the credibility of the King and of the Whig Party, but Walpole defended both with skilful oratory in the House of Commons</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2013}}Walpole's first year as Prime Minister was also marked by the discovery of a plot formed by [[Francis Atterbury]], the [[Bishop of Rochester]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=188}} The exposure of the scheme crushed the hopes of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]] whose previous attempts at rebellion (most notably the risings of 1715 and 1719) had also failed</span>
				<span class='text'>The Tory Party was equally unfortunate even though Lord Bolingbroke, a Tory leader who fled to France to avoid punishment for his Jacobite sympathies, was permitted to return to Britain in 1723</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2013}}During the remainder of George I's reign, Walpole's ascendancy continued; the political power of the monarch was gradually diminishing and that of his ministers gradually increasing</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2013}} In 1724 the primary political rival of Walpole and Townshend in the Cabinet, Lord Carteret, was dismissed from the post of Southern Secretary and once again appointed to the lesser office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland</span>
				<span class='text'>In Ireland, Lord Carteret used his power to secretly aid in the controversy over [[William Wood (Mintmaster)|Wood's Halfpence]] and support ''[[Drapier's Letters]]'' behind the scenes and cause harm to Walpole's power</span>

				<span class='text'>Walpole was not consulted and stated that Townshend was &quot;too precipitate&quot; in his actions</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=190}} Great Britain, free from Jacobite threats, from war, and from financial crises, grew prosperous, and Robert Walpole acquired the favour of George I</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2013}} In 1725 he persuaded the king to revive the [[Order of the Bath|Knight of the Bath]],{{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=190}} and in 1726 a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]],{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} earning him the nickname &quot;Sir Bluestring&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Leadam|1899|p=190}} He was one of the Founder Knights of the [[Order of the Bath]], and was the 545th [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]]</span>
