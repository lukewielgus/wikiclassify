				<span class='text'>{{About|the royal title|the musician |Prince (musician)|other uses|Prince (disambiguation)}}{{Ranks of Nobility}}A '''prince''' is a male ruler, [[monarch]], or member of a monarch's or former monarch's family</span>
				<span class='text'>''Prince'' is also a [[hereditary title]] in the [[nobility]] of some European [[State (polity)|states]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The feminine equivalent is a [[princess]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[English language|English word]] derives, via the [[French language|French word]] ''prince'', from the [[Latin]] noun ''[[princeps]]'', from ''primus'' (first) + ''capio'' (to seize), meaning &quot;the chief, most distinguished, [[ruler]], prince&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|350px|Cicero attacks [[Catiline]] in the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] of the Roman Republic</span>
				<span class='text'>]The [[Latin]] word ''prƒ´nceps'' (older Latin *prƒ´smo-kaps, literally &quot;the one who takes the first [place/position]&quot;), became the usual title of the informal leader of the [[Roman senate]] some centuries before the transition to [[Roman Empire|empire]], the ''[[princeps senatus]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>[Emperor Augustus]] established the formal position of monarch on the basis of ''[[principate]]'', not ''[[Dominate|dominion]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He also tasked his grandsons as summer rulers of the city when most of the government were on holiday in the country or attending religious rituals, and, for that task, granted them the title of ''princeps''</span>
				<span class='text'>he title has generic and substantive meanings:* generically, ''prince'' refers to members of a family that [[monarchy|ruled by hereditary right]], the title being used to refer either to sovereigns or to [[Cadet (genealogy)|cadets]] of a sovereign's family</span>
				<span class='text'>The term may be broadly used of persons in various cultures, continents or eras</span>
				<span class='text'>In Europe, it is the title legally borne by dynastic cadets in monarchies, and borne by courtesy by members of formerly reigning dynasties</span>
				<span class='text'> as a [[substantive title]], a ''prince'' was a monarch of the lowest [[Nobility|rank]] in post-[[Napol√©on I of France|Napoleon]]ic Europe, e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Princes of, respectively, [[Andorra]], [[Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]], [[Mingrelia]], [[Monaco]], [[Waldeck and Pyrmont]], [[Wallachia]], etc</span>
				<span class='text'> also substantively, the title was granted by [[pope]]s and secular monarchs to specific individuals and to the [[agnatic primogeniture|heads]] of some high-ranking European families who, however, never exercised dynastic sovereignty and whose cadets are not entitled to share the princely title, e</span>

				<span class='text'> generically, cadets of some non-sovereign families whose head bears the non-dynastic title of prince (or, less commonly, [[duke]]) were sometimes also authorized to use the princely title, e</span>

				<span class='text'> substantively, the [[heir apparent|heirs apparent]] in some monarchies use a specific princely title associated with a territory within the monarch's [[realm]], e</span>

				<span class='text'>the Princes of, respectively, Asturias (Spain), Gr√£o Par√° (Brazil, formerly), Orange (Netherlands), Viana (Navarre, formerly), Wales (UK), etc</span>
				<span class='text'> substantively, it became the fashion from the 17th century for the [[heir apparent|heirs apparent]] of the leading [[duke|ducal]] families to assume a princely title, associated with a ''[[fief|seigneurie]]'' in the family's possession</span>
				<span class='text'>These titles were borne by courtesy and preserved by tradition, not law, e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the ''princes de'', respectively, Bidache (Gramont), Marcillac (La Rochefoucauld), Tonnay-Charente (Mortemart), Poix (Noailles), L√©on (Rohan-Chabot),==Prince as generic for ruler==The original, but now less common use of the word, originated in the application of the Latin word ''[[princeps]]'', from [[Byzantine Empire|late Roman]] [[law]], and the classical system of government that eventually gave way to the European [[feudalism|feudal]] society</span>
				<span class='text'> In this sense, a prince is a ruler of a territory which is [[sovereign]], or [[quasi]]-sovereign, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>  exercising substantial (though not all) prerogatives associated with monarchs of independent nations, as was common, for instance, within the historical boundaries of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In [[medieval]] and [[Early Modern Europe]], there were as many as two hundred such territories, especially in Italy, Germany, and [[Gaelic Ireland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In this sense, &quot;prince&quot; is used of any and all rulers, regardless of actual title or precise rank</span>
				<span class='text'>This is the [[Renaissance]] use of the term found in [[Niccol√≤ Machiavelli]]'s famous work, ''[[The Prince|Il Principe]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;As a title, by the end of the medieval era, ''prince'' was borne by rulers of territories that were either substantially smaller than or exercised fewer of the rights of sovereignty than did emperors and kings</span>
				<span class='text'>A [[lord]] of even a quite small territory might come to be referred to as a ''prince'' before the 13th century, either from translations of a native title into the Latin ''princeps'' (as for the hereditary ruler of [[Wales]]), or when the lord's territory was [[allodial title|allodial]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The lord of an [[allodial title|allodium]] owned his lands and exercised prerogatives over the subjects in his territory absolutely, owing no feudal homage or duty as a vassal to a [[feudalism|liege lord]], nor being subject to any higher jurisdiction</span>
				<span class='text'>Most small territories designated as principalities during feudal eras were allodial, e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the [[Dombes|Princedom of Dombes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ords who exercised lawful authority over territories and people within a feudal hierarchy were also sometimes regarded as ''princes'' in the general sense, especially if they held the rank of [[count]] or higher</span>
				<span class='text'>This is attested in some surviving [[style (manner of address)|styles]] for e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> British earls, [[marquess]]es, and [[duke]]s are still addressed by the [[The Crown|Crown]] on [[ceremony|ceremonial]] occasions as ''high and noble princes'' (cf</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Royal and noble styles]])</span>
				<span class='text'>n parts of the Holy Roman Empire in which [[primogeniture]] did not prevail (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Germany), all legitimate [[patrilineality|agnates]] had an equal right to the family's hereditary titles</span>
				<span class='text'>While this meant that offices, such as [[emperor]], [[king]], and [[prince elector|elector]] could only be legally occupied by one dynast at a time, holders of such other titles as [[duke]], [[margrave]], [[landgrave]], [[count palatine]], and prince could only differentiate themselves by adding the name of their [[appanage]] to the family's original title</span>
				<span class='text'>Not only did this tend to proliferate unwieldy titles (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[[Catherine II of Russia|Princess Katherine of Anhalt-Zerbst]] and [[Charles X of Sweden|Karl, Count Palatine of Zweibr√ºcken-Neukastell-Kleeburg]] and [[Prince Christian Charles of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Pl√∂n-Norburg]]), but as [[agnatic primogeniture]] gradually became the norm in the Holy Roman Empire by the end of the 18th century, another means of distinguishing the monarch from other members of his dynasty became necessary</span>
				<span class='text'>Gradual substitution of the title of ''Prinz'' for the monarch's title of ''F√ºrst'' occurred, and became customary in all German dynasties except in the grand duchies of [[Mecklenburg]] and [[Oldenburg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Almanach de Gotha'' (Gotha: Justus Perthes, 1944), pages 14‚Äì131</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Both ''Prinz'' and ''F√ºrst'' are translated into English as &quot;prince&quot;, but they reflect not only different but mutually exclusive terms</span>
				<span class='text'>his distinction had evolved before the 18th century (in most families: Liechtenstein long remained an exception, cadets and females using ''F√ºrst/F√ºrstin'' into the 19th century) for dynasties headed by a ''F√ºrst'' in Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>The custom spread through the [[Continental Europe|Continent]] to such an extent that a renowned imperial general who belonged to a [[cadet branch]] of a reigning ducal family, remains best known to history by the generic dynastic title, ''[[Prince Eugene of Savoy]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Note that the princely title was used as a prefix to his Christian name, which also became customary</span>
				<span class='text'>adets of France's ''[[Foreign Prince|princes √©trangers]]'' began to affect similar usage but when, for example, the [[House of la Tour d'Auvergne|House of La Tour d'Auvergne]]'s ruling dukes of [[Bouillon]], attempted to use the same style, it was initially resisted by historians such as [[P√®re Anselme]] ‚Äì who, however, willingly recognized use of territorial titles, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he accepts that the ducal heir apparent is known as ''prince de Bouillon'', but would record in 1728 only that the heir's cousin, the comte d'Oliergues was &quot;''known as'' the Prince Frederick&quot; (&quot;''dit'' le prince Fr√©d√©ric&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = P√®re Anselme|authorlink= P√®re Anselme|title= Histoire Genealogique et Chronologique de la Maison Royale de France|year = 1728|date=|publisher= Compagnie des Libraires|location= Paris|language= French|pages= 543, 545|chapter= Ducs de Bouillon}}&lt;/ref&gt;The post-medieval rank of ''gef√ºrsteter Graf'' (princely count) embraced but elevated the German equivalent of the intermediate French, English and Spanish nobles</span>
				<span class='text'>In Germany, these nobles rose to dynastic status by preserving from the Imperial crown (''[[de jure]]'' after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648) the exercise of such sovereign prerogatives as the [[mint (coin)|mint]]ing of money; the [[muster (military)|muster]] of military troops and the right to wage war and contract [[treaty|treaties]]; local judicial authority and [[constabulary|constabular]] enforcement; and the habit of inter-marrying with sovereign dynasties</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually, these titles came to be more highly valued than that of ''[[F√ºrst]]'' itself, and by the 19th century, their cadets would become known as ''Prinzen''</span>

				<span class='text'>]Currently, the husband of a [[queen regnant]] is usually titled prince or [[prince consort]], whereas the wives of male monarchs take the female equivalent of their husband's title‚Äîthe same as is used when a female mounts the throne in her own right, such as [[empress]] or queen</span>
				<span class='text'>In Brazil, Spain and Portugal, however, the husband of a female monarch was accorded the masculine equivalent of her title‚Äîat least after she bore him a child</span>
				<span class='text'>In previous epochs, husbands of queens regnant often shared their [[Prince consort|consort]]s' regnal title and rank{{clarify|date=September 2014}}</span>

				<span class='text'>--&gt;In each case, the title is followed (when available) by the female form and then (not always available, and obviously rarely applicable to a prince of the blood without a principality) the name of the territorial associated with it, each separated by a slash</span>

				<span class='text'>]In Belgium, France, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Russia, Spain and Hungary the title of ''prince'' has also been used as the highest title of [[nobility]] (without being royal), above the title of ''duke'', while the same usage (then as ''f√ºrst'') has occurred in Germany and Austria but then one rank below the title of ''duke'' and above ''count''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''[[Bonniers]] konversationslexikon I'' 1937 pp</span>
				<span class='text'>82-86&lt;/ref&gt;The above is essentially the story of European, Christian dynasties and other nobility, also 'exported' to their colonial and other overseas territories and otherwise adopted by rather westernized societies elsewhere (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Haiti)</span>
				<span class='text'>pplying these essentially western concepts, and terminology, to other cultures even when they don't do so, is common but in many respects rather dubious</span>
				<span class='text'>Different (historical, religious</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> backgrounds have also begot significantly different dynastic and nobiliary systems, which are poorly represented by the 'closest' western analogy</span>
				<span class='text'>t therefore makes sense to treat these per civilization</span>
				<span class='text'>==Islamic traditions===*Arabian tradition since the [[caliphate]] ‚Äì in several monarchies it remains customary to use the title [[Sheikh]] (in itself below princely rank) for all members of the royal family</span>
				<span class='text'>In families (often reigning dynasties) which claim descent from [[Muhammad]], this is expressed in either of a number of titles (supposing different exact relations): sayid, sharif; these are retained even when too remote from any line of succession to be a member of any dynasty</span>
				<span class='text'>Malay countries*In the Ottoman Empire, the sovereign of imperial rank (incorrectly known in the west as ''(Great) sultan'') was styled [[padishah]] with a host of additional titles, reflecting his claim as political successor to the various conquered states</span>
				<span class='text'>Princes of the blood, male and female, were given the style [[sultan]] (normally reserved for Muslim rulers)*Persia (Iran) ‚Äì Princes as members of a royal family, are referred to by the title ''Shahzadeh'', meaning &quot;descendant of the king&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the word ''zadeh'' could refer to either a male or female descendant, ''Shahzadeh'' had the parallel meaning of &quot;princess&quot; as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Princes can also be sons of provincial kings ([[Khan (title)|Khan]]) and the title referring to them would be the title of Khanzadeh</span>
				<span class='text'>Princes as people who got a title from the King are called &quot;[[Mirza]]&quot;, diminutive of &quot;Amir Zadeh&quot; (King's Son)</span>
				<span class='text'>In Indian Muslim dynasties, the most common titles were [[Mirza]] (from ''Amirzada'') and [[Shah#Shahzada|Shahzada]]; while [[Nawabzada]] and [[Sahibzada]] were also given to younger blood princes</span>
				<span class='text'>==Non-Islamic Asian traditions=======China====In ancient China, the title of prince developed from being the highest title of [[Chinese nobility|nobility]] (synonymous with [[duke]]) in the [[Zhou Dynasty]], to five grades of princes (not counting the sons and grandsons of the emperor) by the time of the fall of the [[Qing Dynasty]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he Chinese word for prince ''Wang'' ({{lang|ch|Áéã}}, literally, King) as Chinese believe the emperor ''Huang Di'' ({{lang|ch|ÁöáÂ∏ù}}) is the ruler of all kings</span>
				<span class='text'>The most accurate translations of the English word &quot;prince&quot; are ''Huang Zi'' ({{lang|ch|ÁöáÂ≠ê}}, lit</span>
				<span class='text'>Son of the Emperor) or ''Wang Zi'' ({{lang|ch|ÁéãÂ≠ê}}, lit</span>
				<span class='text'>Son of the King)</span>
				<span class='text'>===Japan====In Japan, the title ''K≈çshaku'' ({{lang|ja|ÂÖ¨Áàµ}}) was used as the highest title of ''[[Kazoku]]'' ({{lang|ja|ËèØÊóè}} Japanese modern nobility) before the present constitution</span>
				<span class='text'>''K≈çshaku'', however, is more commonly translated as &quot;Duke&quot; to avoid confusion with the following royal ranks in the Imperial Household: ''Shinn≈ç'' ({{lang|ja|Ë¶™Áéã}} literally, Prince of the Blood); female ''Naishinn≈ç'' ({{lang|ja|ÂÜÖË¶™Áéã}} lit</span>
				<span class='text'> Princess (by herself) of the Blood); and ''Shinn≈çhi'' {{lang|ja|Ë¶™ÁéãÂ¶É}} lit</span>
				<span class='text'>  Princess Consort); or ''≈å'' ({{lang|ja|Áéã}} lit</span>
				<span class='text'> Prince); female, ''Jyo-≈å'' ({{lang|ja|Â•≥Áéã}} lit</span>
				<span class='text'> Princess (by herself)); and ''≈åhi'' ({{lang|ja|ÁéãÂ¶É}} lit</span>
				<span class='text'> Princess Consort)</span>
				<span class='text'>The former is the higher title of a male member of the Imperial family while the latter is the lower</span>
				<span class='text'>===Korea====In [[Joseon Dynasty]], the title &quot;Prince&quot; was used for the king's male-line descendant</span>
				<span class='text'>Prince translated generally into three divisions</span>
				<span class='text'>The king's legitimate son used title ''daegun'' (ÎåÄÍµ∞, Â§ßÂêõ, literally '''Grand Prince''')</span>
				<span class='text'>A son born of a concubine and king's great-great-grand son used title ''gun'' (Íµ∞, Âêõ, lit</span>
				<span class='text'>'''Prince''')</span>
				<span class='text'>But the title of ''gun'' wasn't limited to royal family</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, it was often granted as an honorary and non-hereditory title</span>
				<span class='text'>resently, as noble titles are no more granted or even recognized by the people, the English word &quot;Prince&quot; is usually translated as ''wangja'' (ÏôïÏûê, ÁéãÂ≠ê, lit</span>
				<span class='text'>'''king's son'''), only rendering the usage in foreign royal families</span>
				<span class='text'>Princes and principalities in continental Europe are almost always confused with dukes and duchies, both being translated as ''gong'' (Í≥µ, ÂÖ¨, lit</span>
				<span class='text'>'''duke''') and ''gongguk'' (Í≥µÍµ≠, ÂÖ¨Âúã, lit</span>
