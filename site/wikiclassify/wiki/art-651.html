				<span class='text'>Returning to Oxford in 1729 after serving as [[curate]] at his father's parish, he led the [[Holy Club]], a club for the purpose of study and the pursuit of a devout Christian life; it had been founded by his brother Charles, and counted George Whitefield among its members</span>
				<span class='text'>After an unsuccessful ministry of two years at [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] in the [[Georgia Colony]], Wesley returned to London and joined a religious society led by [[Moravian Church|Moravian Christians]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On 24 May 1738 he experienced what has come to be called his evangelical conversion, when he felt his &quot;heart strangely warmed&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He subsequently departed from the Moravians, beginning his own ministry</span>
				<span class='text'> key step in the development of Wesley's ministry was, like Whitefield, to travel and [[Open-air preaching|preach outdoors]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast to Whitefield's [[Calvinism]], however, Wesley embraced the [[Arminianism|Arminian doctrines]] that dominated the [[Church of England]] at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>Moving across Great Britain, North America and Ireland, he helped to form and organise small Christian groups that developed intensive and personal accountability, [[discipleship]] and religious instruction</span>
				<span class='text'>Most importantly, he appointed itinerant, unordained [[Evangelism|evangelist]]s to travel and preach as he did and to care for these groups of people</span>
				<span class='text'>Under Wesley's direction, Methodists became leaders in many social issues of the day, including [[prison reform]] and the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough he was not a [[Systematic theology|systematic theologian]], Wesley argued for the notion of [[Christian perfection]] and against Calvinism{{spaced ndash}}and, in particular, against its doctrine of [[predestination]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He held that, in this life, Christians could achieve a state where the [[Love of God (Christianity)|love of God]] &quot;reigned supreme in their hearts&quot;, giving them [[Holiness movement|outward holiness]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His evangelicalism, firmly grounded in [[Sacrament|sacramental theology]], maintained that [[means of grace]] were the manner by which God [[Sanctification|sanctifies]] and transforms the believer, encouraging people to experience [[Jesus Christ]] personally</span>
				<span class='text'>hroughout his life, Wesley remained within the [[Established church|established]] Anglican church, insisting that the Methodist movement lay well within its tradition</span>

				<span class='text'>Samuel Wesley was a graduate of the [[University of Oxford]] and a poet who, since 1696, had been [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of Epworth</span>
				<span class='text'>He had married Susanna, the twenty-fifth child of [[Samuel Annesley]], a [[Dissenter|Dissenting]] minister, in 1689</span>
				<span class='text'>Ultimately, she bore him nineteen children, of which nine lived beyond infancy</span>
				<span class='text'>She and Samuel Wesley had both become members of the Church of England as young adults</span>
				<span class='text'>s in many families at the time, Wesley's parents gave their children their early education</span>
				<span class='text'>Each child, including the girls, was taught to read as soon as they could walk and talk</span>
				<span class='text'>They were expected to become proficient in [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] and to have learned major portions of the [[New Testament]] by heart</span>
				<span class='text'>Susanna Wesley examined each child before the midday meal and prior to evening prayers</span>
				<span class='text'>Children were not allowed to eat between meals and were interviewed singularly by their mother one evening each week for the purpose of intensive spiritual instruction</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1714, at age 11, Wesley was sent to the [[Charterhouse School]] in London (under the mastership of [[John King (clergyman)|John King]] from 1715), where he lived the studious, methodical and, for a while, religious life in which he had been trained at home</span>
				<span class='text'>part from his disciplined upbringing, a [[rectory]] fire which occurred on 9 February 1709, when Wesley was five years old, left an indelible impression</span>
				<span class='text'>Some time after 11:00&amp;nbsp;p</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> the rectory roof caught on fire</span>
				<span class='text'>Sparks falling on the children‚Äôs beds and cries of &quot;fire&quot; from the street roused the Wesleys who managed to shepherd all their children out of the house except for John who was left stranded on the second floor</span>
				<span class='text'>With stairs aflame and the roof about to collapse, Wesley was lifted out of the second floor window by a parishioner standing on another man‚Äôs shoulders</span>
				<span class='text'>Wesley later utilized the phrase, &quot;a brand plucked out of the fire&quot;, quoting Zechariah 3:2, to describe the incident</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1724, Wesley graduated as a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and decided to pursue a [[Master of Arts]] degree</span>
				<span class='text'>He was ordained a [[deacon]] on 25 September 1725, [[holy orders]] being a necessary step toward becoming a [[fellow]] and tutor at the university</span>
				<span class='text'>n the year of his ordination he read [[Thomas √† Kempis]] and [[Jeremy Taylor]], and began to seek the religious truths which underlay the great revival of the 18th century</span>
				<span class='text'>The reading of Law's ''Christian Perfection'' and ''A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life'' gave him, he said, a sublimer view of the law of God; and he resolved to keep it, inwardly and outwardly, as sacredly as possible, believing that in obedience he would find salvation</span>
				<span class='text'>He pursued a rigidly methodical and abstemious life, studied the Scriptures, and performed his religious duties diligently, depriving himself so that he would have alms to give</span>
				<span class='text'>He began to seek after holiness of heart and life</span>
				<span class='text'>n March 1726, Wesley was unanimously elected a fellow of [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]], Oxford</span>
				<span class='text'>This carried with it the right to a room at the college and regular salary</span>
				<span class='text'>While continuing his studies, Wesley taught [[Greek language|Greek]], lectured on the New Testament and moderated daily disputations at the university</span>
				<span class='text'>However, a call to ministry intruded upon his academic career</span>
				<span class='text'>In August 1727, after taking his master's degree, Wesley returned to Epworth</span>
				<span class='text'>His father had requested his assistance in serving the neighbouring cure of Wroote</span>
				<span class='text'>Ordained a priest on 22 September 1728, Wesley served as a parish [[curate]] for two years</span>
				<span class='text'>He returned to Oxford in November 1729 at the request of the [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of Lincoln College and to maintain his status as junior Fellow</span>
				<span class='text'>== Holy Club ==={{further|Holy Club}}During Wesley's absence, his younger brother Charles (1707‚Äì88) matriculated at Christ Church</span>
				<span class='text'>Along with two fellow students, he formed a small club for the purpose of study and the pursuit of a devout Christian life</span>
				<span class='text'>On Wesley's return, he became the leader of the group which increased somewhat in number and greatly in commitment</span>
				<span class='text'>The group met daily from six until nine for prayer, [[psalm]]s, and reading of the Greek [[New Testament]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They prayed every waking hour for several minutes and each day for a special virtue</span>
				<span class='text'>While the church's prescribed attendance was only three times a year, they took communion every Sunday</span>
				<span class='text'>They [[fasting|fasted]] on Wednesdays and Fridays until three o'clock as was commonly observed in the ancient church</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1730, the group began the practice of visiting prisoners in jail</span>
				<span class='text'>They preached, educated, and relieved jailed debtors whenever possible, and cared for the sick</span>
				<span class='text'>iven the low ebb of spirituality in Oxford at that time, it was not surprising that Wesley's group provoked a negative reaction</span>
				<span class='text'>They were considered to be religious &quot;enthusiasts&quot; which in the context of the time meant religious fanatics</span>
				<span class='text'>University wits styled them the &quot;Holy Club,&quot; a title of derision</span>
				<span class='text'>Currents of opposition became a furor following the mental breakdown and death of a group member, William Morgan</span>

				<span class='text'>He approached the Georgia mission as a High Churchman, seeing it as an opportunity to revive &quot;primitive Christianity&quot; in a primitive environment</span>
				<span class='text'>Although his primary goal was to evangelize the Native Americans, a shortage of clergy in the colony largely limited his ministry to European settlers in Savannah</span>
				<span class='text'>While his ministry has often been judged to have been a failure in comparison to his later success as a leader in the Evangelical Revival, Wesley gathered around him a group of devoted Christians who met in a number of small group religious societies</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, attendance at church services and communion increased over the course of nearly two years in which he served as Savannah's parish priest</span>
				<span class='text'>onetheless, Wesley's High Church ministry was controversial amongst the colonists and it ended in disappointment after Wesley fell in love with a young woman named Sophia Hopkey</span>
				<span class='text'>Following her marriage to William Williamson, Wesley believed Sophia's former zeal for practising the Christian faith declined</span>
				<span class='text'>In strictly applying the rubrics of the Book of Common Prayer, Wesley denied her communion after she failed to signify to him in advance her intention of taking it</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, legal proceedings against him ensued in which a clear resolution seemed unlikely</span>
				<span class='text'>In December 1737, Wesley fled the colony and returned to England</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1738 he went to [[Herrnhut]], the Moravian headquarters in Germany, to study</span>
				<span class='text'>On his return to England, Wesley drew up rules for the &quot;bands&quot; into which the [[Fetter Lane Society]] was divided and published a collection of [[hymn]]s for them</span>
				<span class='text'>He met frequently with this and other religious societies in London but did not preach often in 1738, because most of the [[parish church]]es were closed to him</span>
				<span class='text'>esley's Oxford friend, the evangelist George Whitefield, was also excluded from the churches of [[Bristol]] upon his return from America</span>
				<span class='text'>Going to the neighbouring village of [[Kingswood, South Gloucestershire|Kingswood]], in February 1739, Whitefield preached in the open air to a company of miners</span>
				<span class='text'>Later he preached in [[Whitefield's Tabernacle, Kingswood|Whitefield's Tabernacle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Wesley hesitated to accept Whitefield's call to copy this bold step</span>
				<span class='text'>Overcoming his scruples, he preached the first time at Whitefield's invitation [[Open-air preaching|sermon in the open air]], near Bristol, in April 1739</span>
				<span class='text'>Wesley wrote,{{Quote|I could scarce reconcile myself to this strange way of preaching in the fields, of which he [Whitefield] set me an example on Sunday; having been all my life till very lately so tenacious of every point relating to decency and order, that I should have thought the saving of souls almost a sin if it had not been done in a church</span>

				<span class='text'>A large debt was contracted, and Wesley's friends urged him to keep it under his own control, so the deed was cancelled and he became sole trustee</span>
				<span class='text'>Following this precedent, all Methodist chapels were committed in trust to him until by a &quot;deed of declaration&quot;, all his interests in them were transferred to a body of preachers called the &quot;Legal Hundred&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>hen disorder arose among some members of the societies, Wesley adopted giving tickets to members, with their names written by his own hand</span>
				<span class='text'>These were renewed every three months</span>
				<span class='text'>Those deemed unworthy did not receive new tickets and dropped out of the society without disturbance</span>
				<span class='text'>The tickets were regarded as commendatory letters</span>
				<span class='text'>hen the debt on a chapel became a burden, it was proposed that one in 12 members should collect offerings regularly from the 11 allotted to him</span>
				<span class='text'>Out of this grew the Methodist class-meeting system in 1742</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to keep the disorderly out of the societies, Wesley established a probationary system</span>
				<span class='text'>He undertook to visit each society regularly in what became the quarterly visitation, or conference</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;societies&quot; /&gt; At the local level, there were numerous societies of different sizes which were grouped into circuits to which traveling preachers were appointed for two-year periods</span>
				<span class='text'>Circuit officials met quarterly under a senior traveling preacher or &quot;assistant</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Conferences with Wesley, traveling preachers and others were convened annually for the purpose of coordinating doctrine and discipline for the entire connection</span>
				<span class='text'>Classes of a dozen or so society members under a leader met weekly for spiritual fellowship and guidance</span>
				<span class='text'>In early years, there were &quot;bands&quot; of the spiritually gifted who consciously pursued perfection</span>
				<span class='text'>Those who were regarded to have achieved it were grouped in select societies or bands</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1744, there were 77 such members</span>
				<span class='text'>There also was a category of penitents which consisted of backsliders</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;societies&quot; /&gt;As the number of preachers and preaching-places increased, doctrinal and administrative matters needed to be discussed; so John and Charles Wesley, along with four other clergy and four lay preachers, met for consultation in London in 1744</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the first Methodist conference; subsequently, the conference (with Wesley as its president) became the ruling body of the Methodist movement</span>
				<span class='text'>Two years later, to help preachers work more systematically and societies receive services more regularly, Wesley appointed &quot;helpers&quot; to definitive [[Methodist Circuit|circuit]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Each circuit included at least 30 appointments a month</span>
				<span class='text'>Believing that the preacher's efficiency was promoted by his being changed from one circuit to another every year or two, Wesley established the &quot;itinerancy&quot; and insisted that his preachers submit to its rules</span>

				<span class='text'>He would not stop preaching, nor dissolve the societies, nor end preaching by lay members</span>

				<span class='text'>= Doctrine and theology ==The 20th-century Wesley scholar [[Albert Outler]] argued in his introduction to the 1964 collection ''John Wesley'' that Wesley developed his theology by using a method that Outler termed the [[Wesleyan Quadrilateral]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In this method, Wesley believed that the living core of the Christian faith was revealed in Scripture; and the Bible was the sole foundational source of theological or doctrinal development</span>
				<span class='text'>The centrality of Scripture was so important for Wesley that he called himself &quot;a man of one book&quot; ‚Äì meaning the Bible ‚Äì although he was well-read for his day</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he believed that doctrine had to be in keeping with Christian orthodox tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>So, tradition was considered the second aspect of the Quadrilateral</span>

				<span class='text'>A marble version exists inside [[Methodist Central Hall Westminster]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]Wesley contended that a part of the theological method would involve experiential faith</span>
				<span class='text'>In other words, truth would be vivified in personal experience of Christians (overall, not individually), if it were really truth</span>
				<span class='text'>And every doctrine must be able to be defended rationally</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not divorce faith from reason</span>
				<span class='text'>Tradition, experience and reason, however, were subject always to Scripture, Wesley argued, because only there is the Word of God revealed &quot;so far as it is necessary for our salvation</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The doctrines which Wesley emphasised in his sermons and writings are [[Prevenient Grace|prevenient grace]], present personal salvation by faith, the witness of the Spirit, and sanctification</span>
				<span class='text'>Prevenient grace was the theological underpinning of his belief that all persons were capable of being saved by faith in Christ</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike the Calvinists of his day, Wesley did not believe in [[predestination]], that is, that some persons had been elected by God for salvation and others for damnation</span>
				<span class='text'>He understood that Christian orthodoxy insisted that salvation was only possible by the sovereign grace of God</span>
				<span class='text'>He expressed his understanding of humanity's relationship to God as utter dependence upon God's grace</span>
				<span class='text'>God was at work to enable all people to be capable of coming to faith by empowering humans to have actual existential freedom of response to God</span>
				<span class='text'>esley defined the witness of the Spirit as: &quot;an inward impression on the soul of believers, whereby the Spirit of God directly testifies to their spirit that they are the children of God</span>

				<span class='text'>This doctrine was closely related to his belief that salvation had to be &quot;personal</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  In his view, a person must ultimately believe the Good News for himself or herself; no one could be in relation to God for another</span>
				<span class='text'>[Sanctification]] he described in 1790 as the &quot;grand ''depositum'' which God has lodged with the people called `Methodists'</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  Wesley taught that sanctification was obtainable after justification by faith, between justification and death</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not contend for &quot;sinless perfection&quot;; rather, he contended that a Christian could be made &quot;[[Christian perfection|perfect in love]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>(Wesley studied [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] and particularly the doctrine of [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|Theosis]])</span>
				<span class='text'>This love would mean, first of all, that a believer's motives, rather than being self-centred, would be guided by the deep desire to please God</span>
				<span class='text'>One would be able to keep from committing what Wesley called, &quot;sin rightly so-called</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  By this he meant a conscious or intentional breach of God's will or laws</span>
				<span class='text'>A person could still be able to sin, but intentional or wilful sin could be avoided</span>
				<span class='text'>econdly, to be made perfect in love meant, for Wesley, that a Christian could live with a primary guiding regard for others and their welfare</span>
				<span class='text'>He based this on Christ's quote that the second great command is &quot;to love your neighbour as you love yourself</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In his view, this orientation would cause a person to avoid any number of sins against his neighbour</span>
				<span class='text'>This love, plus the love for God that could be the central focus of a person's faith, would be what Wesley referred to as &quot;a fulfilment of the law of Christ</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;=== Advocacy of Arminianism ===[[File:John Wesley by William Hamilton</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Wesley preaching, by [[William Hamilton (painter)|William Hamilton]]]]Wesley entered controversies as he tried to enlarge church practice</span>
				<span class='text'>The most notable of his controversies was that on [[Calvinism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His father was of the [[Arminianism in the Church of England|Arminian]] school in the church</span>
				<span class='text'> Wesley came to his own conclusions while in college and expressed himself strongly against the doctrines of Calvinistic election and reprobation</span>
				<span class='text'>His system of thought has become known as [[Arminianism#Wesleyan Arminianism|Wesleyan Arminianism]], the foundations of which were laid by Wesley and Fletcher</span>
				<span class='text'>hitefield inclined to Calvinism</span>
				<span class='text'>In his first tour in America, he embraced the views of the New England School of Calvinism</span>
				<span class='text'>When in 1739 Wesley preached a sermon on ''Freedom of Grace'', attacking the Calvinistic understanding of [[predestination]] as blasphemous, as it represented &quot;God as worse than the devil,&quot; Whitefield asked him not to repeat or publish the discourse, as he did not want a dispute</span>
				<span class='text'> Wesley published his sermon anyway</span>
				<span class='text'>Whitefield was one of many who responded</span>
				<span class='text'>The two men separated their practice in 1741</span>
				<span class='text'>Wesley wrote that those who held to unlimited atonement did not desire separation, but &quot;those who held 'particular redemption' would not hear of any accommodation</span>

				<span class='text'>Whitefield and Wesley, however, were soon back on friendly terms, and their friendship remained unbroken although they travelled different paths</span>
				<span class='text'>When someone asked Whitefield if he thought he would see Wesley in heaven, Whitefield replied, &quot;I fear not, for he will be so near the eternal throne and we at such a distance, we shall hardly get sight of him</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1770, the controversy broke out anew with violence and bitterness, as people's view of God related to their views of men and their possibilities</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Augustus Montague Toplady]], [[Daniel Rowland|Rowland]], [[Sir Richard Hill, 2nd Baronet|Richard Hill]] and others were engaged on one side, while Wesley and Fletcher stood on the other</span>
				<span class='text'>Toplady was editor of ''[[The Gospel Magazine]]'', which had articles covering the controversy</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1778, Wesley began the publication of ''The Arminian Magazine'', not, he said, to convince Calvinists, but to preserve Methodists</span>
				<span class='text'>He wanted to teach the truth that &quot;God willeth all men to be saved</span>
