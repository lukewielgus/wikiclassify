				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|Krochmalna Street in Warsaw (2012)]]Isaac Bashevis Singer was born in 1902 in [[Leoncin]] village near [[Warsaw]], [[Congress Poland|Poland]], under [[Partitions of Poland|military partitions]] by the [[Russian Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'> A few years later, the family moved to a nearby Polish town of [[Radzymin]], which is often and erroneously given as his birthplace</span>
				<span class='text'> The exact date of his birth is uncertain, but most probably it was November 21, 1902, a date that Singer gave both to his official biographer Paul Kresh,{{Sfn | Kresh | 1979 | p = 390}} and his secretary Dvorah Telushkin</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Telushkin | 1997 | p = 266}}  It is also consistent with the historical events he and his brother refer to in their childhood memoirs</span>
				<span class='text'>The often-quoted birth date, July 14, 1904 was made up by the author in his youth, most probably to make himself younger to avoid the draft</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Tree | 2004 | pp = 18‚Äì19}}His father was a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[rabbi]] and his mother, Bathsheba, was the daughter of the rabbi of [[Bi≈Çgoraj]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Singer later used her name in his pen name &quot;Bashevis&quot; (Bathsheba's)</span>
				<span class='text'>Both his older siblings, sister [[Esther Kreitman]] (1891‚Äì1954) and brother [[Israel Joshua Singer]] (1893‚Äì1944), became writers as well</span>
				<span class='text'> Esther was the first of the family to write stories</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Carr | 1992}}The family moved to the court of the Rabbi of Radzymin in 1907, where his father became head of the Yeshiva</span>
				<span class='text'>After the Yeshiva building burned down in 1908, the family moved to a flat at ul</span>
				<span class='text'>Krochmalna 10</span>

				<span class='text'>There his father served as a rabbi, and was called on to be a judge, arbitrator, religious authority and spiritual leader in the Jewish community</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Singer | 1967}} The unique atmosphere of pre-war Krochmalna Street can be found both in the collection of ''Varshavsky-stories'', which tell stories from Singer's childhood,&lt;ref&gt;Best known: ''My Father's Court'' 1966&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in those novels and stories which take place in pre-war Warsaw</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===World War I===In 1917, because of the hardships of World War I, the family split up</span>
				<span class='text'>Singer moved with his mother and younger brother Moshe to his mother's hometown of Bi≈Çgoraj, a traditional ''[[shtetl]],'' where his mother's brothers had followed his grandfather as rabbis</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Singer | 1967}}  When his father became a village rabbi again in 1921, Singer returned to [[Warsaw]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He entered the [[Tachkemoni]] Rabbinical Seminary and soon decided that neither the school nor the profession suited him</span>
				<span class='text'>He returned to Bi≈Çgoraj, where he tried to support himself by giving [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] lessons, but soon gave up and joined his parents, considering himself a failure</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1923 his older brother Israel Joshua arranged for him to move to Warsaw to work as a proofreader for the Jewish ''Literarische Bleter,'' of which the brother was an editor</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Singer | 1976}}===United States===In 1935, four years before the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion]], Singer emigrated from [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] to the [[United States]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was fearful of the growing Nazi threat in neighboring Germany</span>

				<span class='text'> After a promising start, he became despondent and felt for some years &quot;Lost in America&quot; (title of his 1974 novel published in Yiddish; he published it in English in 1981)</span>

				<span class='text'>They married in 1940, and their union seemed to release energy in him; he  returned to prolific writing and to contributing to the ''Forward</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A street in [[Surfside, Florida]] is named Isaac Singer Boulevard in his honor</span>
				<span class='text'>The full academic scholarship for undergraduate students at the [[University of Miami]] is named in his honor</span>
				<span class='text'>=Literary career==Singer's first published story won the literary competition of the ''literarishe bletter'' and garnered him a reputation as a promising talent</span>
				<span class='text'>A reflection of his formative years in &quot;the kitchen of literature&quot;{{Sfn | Telushkin | 1997 | p = 123}} can be found in many of his later works</span>
				<span class='text'>IB Singer published his first novel, ''Satan in Goray,'' in installments in the literary magazine ''Globus'', which he had co-founded with his life-long friend, the Yiddish poet [[Aaron Zeitlin]] in 1935</span>
				<span class='text'>The book recounts events of 1648 in the village of Goraj (close to [[Bi≈Çgoraj]]), where the Jews of Poland lost a third of their population in a wholesale attack by [[Cossacks]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It explores the effects of the seventeenth-century faraway false messiah, [[Shabbatai Zvi]], on the local population</span>
				<span class='text'>Its last chapter imitates the style of a medieval Yiddish chronicle</span>
				<span class='text'>With a stark depiction of innocence crushed by circumstance, the novel appears to foreshadow coming danger</span>
				<span class='text'>In his later work, ''The Slave'' (1962), Singer returns to the aftermath of 1648, in a love story between a Jewish man and a [[Gentile]] woman</span>
				<span class='text'> He portrays the traumatized and desperate survivors of the historic catastrophe with even deeper understanding</span>
				<span class='text'>==''The Family Moskat''===Singer became a literary contributor to the ''Forward'' only after his older brother Israel died in 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>That year, Singer published ''The Family Moskat'' in his brother's honor</span>
				<span class='text'>His own style showed in the daring turns of his action and characters, with (and this in the Jewish family-newspaper in 1945!) double adultery during the holiest of nights of Judaism, the evening of [[Yom Kippur]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was almost forced to stop writing the novel by his legendary editor-in-chief, [[Abraham Cahan]], but was saved by readers who wanted the story to go on</span>
				<span class='text'>After this, his stories‚Äîwhich he had published in Yiddish literary newspapers before‚Äîwere printed in the ''Forward'' as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the 1940s, Singer's reputation grew</span>
				<span class='text'>inger believed in the power of his native language and thought that there was still a large audience, including in New York, who longed to read in Yiddish</span>
				<span class='text'>In an interview in ''Encounter'' (February 1979), he claimed that although the [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jews of Poland]] had died, &quot;something‚Äîcall it spirit or whatever‚Äîis still somewhere in the universe</span>
				<span class='text'>This is a mystical kind of feeling, but I feel there is truth in it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Some of his colleagues and readers were shocked by his all-encompassing view of human nature</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote about female homosexuality (&quot;Zeitl and Rickel&quot;,{{Sfn | Singer | 1968}} &quot;Tseytl un Rikl&quot;), published in ''The Seance and Other Stories''{{Sfn | Singer | 1968a}}), [[transvestism]] (&quot;Yentl the Yeshiva Boy&quot; in ''Short Friday''), and of rabbis corrupted by demons (&quot;Zeidlus the Pope&quot; in ''Short Friday'')</span>
				<span class='text'>In those novels and stories which refer to events in his own life, he portrays himself unflatteringly (with some degree of accuracy) as an artist who is self-centered yet has a keen eye for the sufferings and tribulations of others</span>
				<span class='text'>==Literary influences===Singer had many literary influences; besides the religious texts he studied, he grew up with a rich array of Jewish folktales and worldly Yiddish detective-stories about &quot;Max Spitzkopf&quot; and his assistant &quot;Fuchs</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Sfn | Tree | 2004 | p = 35}} He read Russian, including [[Dostoyevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' at the age of fourteen;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Bashevis | 1967}} He wrote in memoirs about the importance of the Yiddish translations donated in book-crates from America, which he studied as a teenager in Bilgoraj: &quot;I read everything: Stories, novels, plays, essays</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I read [[Avrom Reyzen|Rajsen]], [[Strindberg]], Don Kaplanowitsch, [[Turgenev]], [[Tolstoy]], [[Maupassant]] and [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{Sfn | Bashevis | 1967}}  He studied many philosophers, among them [[Spinoza]],{{Sfn | Bashevis | 1967}}  [[Arthur Schopenhauer]],{{Sfn | Carr | 1992}} and [[Otto Weininger]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Tree | 2004 | p = 68}}  Among his Yiddish contemporaries, Singer considered his older brother to be his greatest artistic example; he was also life-long friend and admirer of the author and poet [[Aaron Zeitlin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>f his non-Yiddish-contemporaries, he was strongly influenced by the writings of [[Knut Hamsun]], many of whose works he later translated, while he had a more critical attitude towards [[Thomas Mann]], whose approach to writing he considered opposed to his own</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Tree | 2004 | p = 88}} Contrary to Hamsun's approach, Singer shaped his world not only with the egos of his characters, but also using the moral commitments of the Jewish tradition known from his youth and embodied by his father in the stories about Singer's youth</span>
				<span class='text'>There was a dichotomy between the life his heroes lead and the life they feel they should lead ‚Äî which gives his art a modernity his predecessors did not express</span>
				<span class='text'>His themes of witchcraft, mystery and legend draw on traditional sources, but they are contrasted with a modern and ironic consciousness</span>
				<span class='text'>They are also concerned with the bizarre and the grotesque</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=May 2014}}Another important strand of his art is intra-familial strife, which he experienced firsthand when taking refuge with his mother and younger brother at his uncle's home in Bi≈Çgoraj</span>
				<span class='text'>This is the central theme in Singer's big family chronicles, such as ''The Family Moskat'' (1950), ''The Manor'' (1967), and ''The Estate'' (1969)</span>
				<span class='text'>Some critics believe these show the influence of [[Thomas Mann]]'s novel ''Buddenbrooks''; Singer had translated Mann's ''Der Zauberberg'' (''[[The Magic Mountain]]'') into Yiddish as a young writer</span>
				<span class='text'>==Language===Singer always wrote and published in Yiddish</span>
				<span class='text'>His novels were serialized in newspapers, which also published his short stories</span>
				<span class='text'>He edited his novels and stories for their publication in English in the United States; these versions were used as the basis for translation into other languages</span>
				<span class='text'>He referred to his English version as his &quot;second original&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>This has led to an ongoing controversy whether the &quot;real Singer&quot; can be found in the Yiddish original, with its finely tuned language and sometimes rambling construction, or in the more tightly edited American versions, where the language is usually simpler and more direct</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Many of Singer's stories and novels have not yet been translated</span>
				<span class='text'>n the short story form, in which many critics feel he made his most lasting contributions, his greatest influences were writers [[Anton Chekhov]] and [[Guy de Maupassant]], Russian and French, respectively</span>
				<span class='text'>From Maupassant, Singer developed a finely grained sense of drama</span>
				<span class='text'> Like those of the French master, Singer's stories can pack enormous visceral excitement in the space of a few pages</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=May 2014}} From Chekhov, Singer developed his ability to draw characters of enormous complexity and dignity in the briefest of spaces</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In the foreword to his personally selected volume of his finest short stories he describes the two aforementioned writers as the greatest masters of the short story form</span>
				<span class='text'>==Illustrators===Several respected artists have illustrated Singer‚Äôs novels, short stories, and children‚Äôs books, including [[Raphael Soyer]], [[Maurice Sendak]], [[Larry Rivers]], and [[Irene Lieblich]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Singer personally selected Lieblich to illustrate some of his books for children, including ''A Tale of Three Wishes'' and ''The Power of Light: Eight Stories for Hanukkah,'' after seeing her work in an exhibition at an Artists Equity exhibit in New York</span>
				<span class='text'>A Holocaust survivor, Lieblich was from Zamosc, Poland, a town adjacent to the area where Singer grew up</span>
				<span class='text'>As their memories of shtetl life were so similar, Singer found Lieblich‚Äôs images ideally suited to illustrate his texts</span>
				<span class='text'>Of her style, Singer wrote that ‚Äúher works are rooted in Jewish folklore and are faithful to Jewish life and the Jewish spirit</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}===Summary===Singer published at least 18 novels, 14 children's books, a number of memoirs, essays and articles</span>
				<span class='text'>He is best known as a writer of short stories, which have been published in more than a dozen collections</span>
				<span class='text'>The first collection of Singer's short stories in English, ''[[Gimpel the Fool]]'', was published in 1957</span>
				<span class='text'>The title story was translated by [[Saul Bellow]] and published in May 1953 in the ''[[Partisan Review]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Selections from Singer's &quot;Varshavsky-stories&quot; in the ''Daily Forward'' were later published in anthologies such as ''My Father's Court'' (1966)</span>
				<span class='text'>Later collections include ''A Crown of Feathers'' (1973), with notable masterpieces in between, such as ''The Spinoza of Market Street'' (1961) and ''A Friend of Kafka'' (1970)</span>
				<span class='text'>His stories and novels reflect the world of the East European Jewry in which he grew up</span>
				<span class='text'>After his many years in America, his stories also portrayed the world of the immigrants and their pursuit of an elusive American dream, which seems always beyond reach</span>
				<span class='text'>rior to Singer's winning the Nobel Prize, English translations of dozens of his stories were frequently published in popular magazines such as ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' and ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' They were publishing literary works and included his stories among their best; in turn, he found them to be appropriate outlets for his work</span>
				<span class='text'>hroughout the 1960s, Singer continued to write on questions of personal morality</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of the controversial aspects of his plots, he was a target of scathing criticism from many quarters, some of it for not being &quot;moral&quot; enough, some for writing stories that no one wanted to hear</span>
				<span class='text'>To his critics he replied, &quot;Literature must spring from the past, from the love of the uniform force that wrote it, and not from the uncertainty of the future</span>

				<span class='text'>[Alan Arkin]] starred as Yasha, the principal character in the 1979 film version of [[The Magician of Lublin]], which also featured [[Shelley Winters]], [[Louise Fletcher]], [[Valerie Perrine]] and [[Lou Jacobi]]</span>
				<span class='text'> In the final scene, Yasha achieves his lifelong ambition of being able to fly, though not quite as the magic trick he had originally planned</span>
				<span class='text'>erhaps the most fascinating{{Sfn | Tree | 2004 | p = 161}} Singer-inspired film is 1974's ''Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Singer's Nightmare or Mrs</span>
				<span class='text'>Pupkos Beard,'' directed by [[Bruce Davidson (photographer)|Bruce Davidson]], a renowned photographer who became Singer's neighbor</span>
				<span class='text'>This unique film is a half-hour mixture of documentary and fantasy for which Singer wrote the script and played the leading role</span>
				<span class='text'>he 2007 film ''[[Love Comes Lately]]'', starring [[Otto Tausig]], was adapted from several of Singer's stories</span>
				<span class='text'>=Beliefs=====Judaism===Singer's relationship to Judaism was complex and unconventional</span>
				<span class='text'>He identified as a skeptic and a loner, though he felt a connection to his Orthodox roots</span>
				<span class='text'>Ultimately, he developed a view of religion and philosophy, which he called &quot;private mysticism: Since God was completely unknown and eternally silent, He could be endowed with whatever traits one elected to hang upon Him</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Grace Farrell, ''Isaac Bashevis Singer: Conversations'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>236, University Press of Mississippi, 1992</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Singer | 1984 | p = 99}}Singer was raised Orthodox and learned all the Jewish prayers, studied Hebrew, and learned Torah and Talmud</span>
				<span class='text'> As he recounted in the autobiographical, &quot;In My Father's Court&quot;, he broke away from his parents in his early twenties</span>
				<span class='text'>Influenced by his older brother, who had done the same, he began spending time with non-religious Bohemian artists in Warsaw</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Singer believed in a God, as in traditional Judaism, he stopped attending Jewish religious services of any kind, even on the High Holy Days</span>
				<span class='text'>He struggled throughout his life with the feeling that a kind and compassionate God would never support the great suffering he saw around him, especially the [[Holocaust]] deaths of so many of the Polish Jews from his childhood</span>
				<span class='text'>In one interview with the photographer Richard Kaplan, he said, &quot;I am angry at God because of what happened to my brothers&quot;: Singer's older brother died suddenly in February 1944, in New York, of a [[thrombosis]]; his younger brother perished in Soviet Russia around 1945, after being deported with his mother and wife to Southern [[Kazakhstan]] in Stalin's purges</span>
				<span class='text'>espite the complexities of his religious outlook, Singer lived in the midst of the Jewish community throughout his life</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not seem to be comfortable unless he was surrounded by Jews; particularly Jews born in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he spoke [[English language|English]], [[Hebrew]], and [[Polish language|Polish]] fluently, he always considered [[Yiddish]] his natural tongue</span>
				<span class='text'>He always wrote in Yiddish and he was the last notable American author to be writing in this language</span>
				<span class='text'>After he had achieved success as a writer in New York, Singer and his wife began spending time during the winters in Miami with its Jewish community, many of them New Yorkers</span>
				<span class='text'>ventually, as senior citizens, they moved to Miami</span>
				<span class='text'>They identified closely with the European Jewish community</span>
				<span class='text'>After his death, Singer was buried in a traditional Jewish ceremony in a Jewish cemetery</span>
				<span class='text'>specially in his short fiction, Singer often wrote about various Jews having religious struggles; sometimes these struggles became violent, bringing death or mental illness</span>
				<span class='text'>In one story his narrator meets a young woman in New York whom he knew from an Orthodox family in Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>She has become a kind of hippie, sings American folk music with a guitar, and rejects Judaism, although the narrator comments that in many ways she seems typically Jewish</span>
				<span class='text'>The narrator says that he often meets Jews who think they are anything but Jewish, and yet still are</span>
				<span class='text'>n the end, Singer remains an unquestionably Jewish writer, yet his precise views about Jews, Judaism, and the Jewish God are open to interpretation</span>
				<span class='text'>Whatever they were, they lay at the center of his literary art</span>
				<span class='text'>==Vegetarianism===Singer was a prominent [[Jewish vegetarianism|Jewish vegetarian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=IVU |url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; for the last 35 years of his life and often included vegetarian themes in his works</span>
				<span class='text'>In his short story, ''The Slaughterer'', he described the anguish of an appointed slaughterer trying to reconcile his compassion for animals with his job of killing them</span>
				<span class='text'>He felt that the ingestion of meat was a denial of all ideals and all religions: &quot;How can we speak of right and justice if we take an innocent creature and shed its blood?&quot; When asked if he had become a vegetarian for health reasons, he replied: &quot;I did it for the health of the chickens</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;In ''The Letter Writer'', he wrote &quot;In relation to [animals], all people are Nazis; for the animals, it is an eternal [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{Sfn | Singer| 1982|p = 271}} which became a classical reference in the discussions about the legitimacy of the [[Animal rights and the Holocaust|comparison of animal exploitation with the holocaust]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n the preface to Steven Rosen's &quot;Food for Spirit: Vegetarianism and the World Religions&quot; (1986), Singer wrote, &quot;When a human kills an animal for food, he is neglecting his own hunger for justice</span>
				<span class='text'>Man prays for mercy, but is unwilling to extend it to others</span>
				<span class='text'>Why should man then expect mercy from God? It's unfair to expect something that you are not willing to give</span>
				<span class='text'>It is inconsistent</span>
				<span class='text'>I can never accept inconsistency or injustice</span>
				<span class='text'>Even if it comes from God</span>
				<span class='text'>If there would come a voice from God saying, &quot;I'm against vegetarianism!&quot; I would say, &quot;Well, I am for it!&quot; This is how strongly I feel in this regard</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;===Politics===Singer described himself as &quot;[[conservative]],&quot; adding that &quot;I don't believe by flattering the masses all the time we really achieve much</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/stable/25304019 |title=Chicago Review |volume=31 |number=4 |date=Spring 1980 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; His conservative side was most apparent in his Yiddish writing and journalism, where he was openly hostile to [[Marxist]] sociopolitical agendas</span>
				<span class='text'>In Forverts he once wrote, &quot;It may seem like terrible apikorses [heresy], but conservative governments in America, England, France, have handled Jews no worse than liberal governments</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> The Jew's worst enemies were always those elements that the modern Jew convinced himself (really hypnotized himself) were his friends</span>
