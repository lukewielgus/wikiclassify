				<span class='text'>Dryden's dates are often given using the Gregorian or [[Julian calender]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>--&gt;He is seen as dominating the  literary life of [[Restoration (England)|Restoration England]] to such a point that the period came to be known in literary circles as the Age of Dryden</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Walter Scott]] called him &quot;Glorious John</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;What, with ''Glorious John''?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;==Early life==Dryden was born in the village [[rectory]] of [[Aldwincle]] near [[Thrapston]] in Northamptonshire, where his maternal grandfather was Rector of [[All Saints Church, Aldwincle|All Saints]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the eldest of fourteen children born to Erasmus Dryden and wife Mary Pickering, paternal grandson of [[Sir Erasmus Dryden, 1st Baronet]] (1553‚Äì1632) and wife Frances Wilkes, [[Puritan]] landowning gentry who supported the Puritan cause and Parliament</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a second cousin once removed of [[Jonathan Swift]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As a boy Dryden lived in the nearby village of [[Titchmarsh, Northamptonshire]] where it is likely that he received his first education</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1644 he was sent to [[Westminster School]] as a King's Scholar where his headmaster was Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Richard Busby]], a charismatic teacher and severe disciplinarian</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, David, ''John Dryden'', ed</span>
				<span class='text'>by Isobel Armstrong, (Tavistock: Northcote House Publishers, 2004), 22&lt;/ref&gt; Having recently been re-founded by Elizabeth I, Westminster during this period embraced a very different religious and political spirit encouraging royalism and [[High church|high Anglicanism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Whatever Dryden's response to this was, he clearly respected the Headmaster and would later send two of his sons to school at Westminster</span>
				<span class='text'>s a humanist public school, Westminster maintained a curriculum which trained pupils in the art of rhetoric and the presentation of arguments for both sides of a given issue</span>
				<span class='text'>This is a skill which would remain with Dryden and influence his later writing and thinking, as much of it displays these dialectical patterns</span>
				<span class='text'>The Westminster curriculum included weekly translation assignments which developed Dryden's capacity for assimilation</span>
				<span class='text'>This was also to be exhibited in his later works</span>
				<span class='text'>His years at Westminster were not uneventful, and his first published poem, an elegy with a strong royalist feel on the death of his schoolmate [[Henry, Lord Hastings]] from [[smallpox]], alludes to the execution of King Charles I, which took place on 30 January 1649, very near the school where Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Busby had first prayed for the King and then locked in his schoolboys to prevent their attending the spectacle</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1650 Dryden went up to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=DRDN650J|name=Dryden, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here he would have experienced a return to the religious and political ethos of his childhood: the Master of Trinity was a Puritan preacher by the name of [[Thomas Hill (Cambridge)|Thomas Hill]] who had been a rector in Dryden's home village</span>

				<span class='text'>by Keith Walker, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987), ix-x&lt;/ref&gt; Though there is little specific information on Dryden's undergraduate years, he would most certainly have followed the standard curriculum of classics, rhetoric, and mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1654 he obtained his BA, graduating top of the list for Trinity that year</span>
				<span class='text'>In June of the same year Dryden's father died, leaving him some land which generated a little income, but not enough to live on</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''John Dryden The Major Works'', ed</span>
				<span class='text'>by Keith Walker, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987), x&lt;/ref&gt;Returning to London during [[The Protectorate]], Dryden obtained work with Cromwell's Secretary of State, [[John Thurloe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This appointment may have been the result of influence exercised on his behalf by his cousin the Lord Chamberlain, Sir [[Sir Gilbert Pickering, 1st Baronet|Gilbert Pickering]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At Cromwell's funeral on 23 November 1658 Dryden processed with the Puritan poets [[John Milton]] and [[Andrew Marvell]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly thereafter he published his first important poem, ''Heroic Stanzas'' (1658), a eulogy on Cromwell's death which is cautious and prudent in its emotional display</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1660 Dryden celebrated the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the monarchy and the return of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] with ''[[Astraea Redux]]'', an authentic royalist [[panegyric]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In this work the interregnum is illustrated as a time of anarchy, and Charles is seen as the restorer of peace and order</span>
				<span class='text'>=Later life and career==After the Restoration, as Dryden quickly established himself as the leading poet and literary critic of his day, he transferred his allegiances to the new government</span>
				<span class='text'>Along with ''Astraea Redux'', Dryden welcomed the new regime with two more panegyrics: ''To His Sacred Majesty: A Panegyric on his Coronation'' (1662) and ''To My Lord Chancellor'' (1662)</span>
				<span class='text'>These poems suggest that Dryden was looking to court a possible patron, but he was to instead make a living in writing for publishers, not for the aristocracy, and thus ultimately for the reading public</span>
				<span class='text'>These, and his other nondramatic poems, are occasional‚Äîthat is, they celebrate public events</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus they are written for the nation rather than the self, and the [[Poet Laureate]] (as he would later become) is obliged to write a certain number of these per annum</span>

				<span class='text'> (New York: Norton &amp; Co, 2000), 2071&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1662 Dryden was proposed for membership in the [[Royal Society]], and he was elected an early fellow</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Dryden was inactive in Society affairs and in 1666 was expelled for non-payment of his dues</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Portrait of John Dryden by [[Godfrey Kneller]], 1698]]On 1 December 1663 Dryden married the royalist sister of Sir [[Robert Howard (playwright)|Robert Howard]]‚ÄîLady Elizabeth</span>
				<span class='text'>Dryden's works occasionally contain outbursts against the married state but also celebrations of the same</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, little is known of the intimate side of his marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>Lady Elizabeth bore three sons and outlived her husband</span>
				<span class='text'>ith the reopening of the theatres after the Puritan ban, Dryden wrote plays</span>
				<span class='text'>His first play, ''[[The Wild Gallant]]'', appeared in 1663 and was not successful but was still promising, and from 1668 on he was contracted to produce three plays a year for the [[King's Company]] in which he became a shareholder</span>
				<span class='text'>During the 1660s and '70s, theatrical writing was his main source of income</span>
				<span class='text'>He led the way in [[Restoration comedy]], his best-known work being ''[[Marriage √† la mode (play)|Marriage √† la Mode]]'' (1672), as well as heroic tragedy and regular tragedy, in which his greatest success was ''[[All for Love (play)|All for Love]]'' (1678)</span>
				<span class='text'>Dryden was never satisfied with his theatrical writings and frequently suggested that his talents were wasted on unworthy audiences</span>
				<span class='text'>He thus was making a bid for poetic fame off-stage</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1667, around the same time his dramatic career began, he published ''[[Annus Mirabilis (poem)|Annus Mirabilis]]'', a lengthy historical poem which described the English defeat of the Dutch naval fleet and the Great Fire of London in 1666</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a modern epic in pentameter quatrains that established him as the preeminent poet of his generation, and was crucial in his attaining the posts of [[Poet Laureate]] (1668) and historiographer royal (1670)</span>
				<span class='text'>hen the [[Great Plague of London]] closed the theatres in 1665 Dryden retreated to Wiltshire where he wrote ''Of Dramatick Poesie'' (1668), arguably the best of his unsystematic prefaces and essays</span>
				<span class='text'>Dryden constantly defended his own literary practice, and ''Of Dramatick Poesie'', the longest of his critical works, takes the form of a dialogue in which four characters‚Äìeach based on a prominent contemporary, with Dryden himself as 'Neander'‚Äîdebate the merits of classical, French and English drama</span>
				<span class='text'>The greater part of his critical works introduce problems which he is eager to discuss, and show the work of a writer of independent mind who feels strongly about his own ideas, ideas which demonstrate the breadth of his reading</span>
				<span class='text'>He felt strongly about the relation of the poet to tradition and the creative process, and his best heroic play ''[[Aureng-zebe]]'' (1675) has a prologue which denounces the use of rhyme in serious drama</span>
				<span class='text'>His play ''[[All for Love (play)|All for Love]]'' (1678) was written in blank verse, and was to immediately follow ''Aureng-Zebe''</span>
				<span class='text'>On 18 December 1679 he was attacked in Rose Alley near his home in [[Covent Garden]] by thugs hired by [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]],&lt;ref&gt;John Richardson, {{cite book |url=https://books</span>

				<span class='text'>Dryden's main goal in the work is to &quot;satirize Shadwell, ostensibly for his offenses against literature but more immediately we may suppose for his habitual badgering of him on the stage and in print</span>

				<span class='text'>His other major works from this period are the religious poems ''[[Religio Laici]]'' (1682), written from the position of a member of the Church of England; his 1683 edition of ''Plutarch's Lives Translated From the Greek by Several Hands'' in which he introduced the word biography to English readers; and ''[[The Hind and the Panther]],'' (1687) which celebrates his conversion to [[Roman Catholicism]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Dryden translated works by [[Horace]], [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]], [[Ovid]], [[Lucretius]], and [[Theocritus]], a task which he found far more satisfying than writing for the stage</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1694 he began work on what would be his most ambitious and defining work as translator, ''The Works of Virgil'' (1697), which was published by subscription</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|John Dryden near the end of his life]]Dryden was the dominant literary figure and influence of his age</span>
				<span class='text'>He established the [[heroic couplet]] as a standard form of English poetry by writing successful satires, religious pieces, fables, epigrams, compliments, prologues, and plays with it; he also introduced the [[alexandrine]] and triplet into the form</span>
				<span class='text'>In his poems, translations, and criticism, he established a poetic diction appropriate to the heroic couplet‚Äî[[W</span>
				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>Auden|Auden]] referred to him as &quot;the master of the [[middle style]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;W</span>
				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>Auden, ''New Year Letter,'' in Collected Poems&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîthat was a model for his contemporaries and for much of the 18th century</span>
				<span class='text'>The considerable loss felt by the English literary community at his death was evident in the elegies written about him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''John Dryden The Major Works'', 37&lt;/ref&gt; Dryden's heroic couplet became the dominant poetic form of the 18th century</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Alexander Pope]] was heavily influenced by Dryden and often borrowed from him; other writers were equally influenced by Dryden and Pope</span>
				<span class='text'>Pope famously praised Dryden's versification in his imitation of [[Horace]]'s Epistle II</span>
				<span class='text'>: &quot;Dryden taught to join / The varying pause, the full resounding line, / The long majestic march, and energy divine</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Samuel Johnson&lt;ref&gt;''Dryden,'' in Samuel Johnson, The Major Works (ed</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Donald Greene]]), 707&lt;/ref&gt; summed up the general attitude with his remark that &quot;the veneration with which his name is pronounced by every cultivator of English literature, is paid to him as he refined the language, improved the sentiments, and tuned the numbers of English poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; His poems were very widely read, and are often quoted, for instance, in ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' and Johnson's essays</span>
				<span class='text'>ohnson also noted, however, that &quot;He is, therefore, with all his variety of excellence, not often pathetic; and had so little sensibility of the power of effusions purely natural, that he did not esteem them in others</span>
				<span class='text'>Simplicity gave him no pleasure</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Readers in the first half of the 18th century did not mind this too much, but later generations considered Dryden's absence of sensibility a fault</span>
				<span class='text'>ne of the first attacks on Dryden's reputation was by [[Wordsworth]], who complained that Dryden's descriptions of natural objects in his translations from Virgil were much inferior to the originals</span>
				<span class='text'>However, several of Wordsworth's contemporaries, such as [[George Crabbe]], [[Lord Byron]], and [[Walter Scott]] (who edited Dryden's works), were still keen admirers of Dryden</span>
				<span class='text'>Besides, Wordsworth did admire many of Dryden's poems, and his famous &quot;Intimations of Immortality&quot; ode owes something stylistically to Dryden's &quot;[[Alexander's Feast (Dryden)|Alexander's Feast]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>[[John Keats]] admired the &quot;Fables&quot;, and imitated them in his poem ''Lamia''</span>
				<span class='text'>Later 19th century writers had little use for verse satire, Pope, or Dryden; Matthew Arnold famously dismissed them as &quot;classics of our prose</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He did have a committed admirer in [[George Saintsbury]], and was a prominent figure in quotation books such as Bartlett's, but the next major poet to take an interest in Dryden was [[T</span>
				<span class='text'>S</span>
				<span class='text'>Eliot]], who wrote that he was 'the ancestor of nearly all that is best in the poetry of the eighteenth century', and that 'we cannot fully enjoy or rightly estimate a hundred years of English poetry unless we fully enjoy Dryden</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, T</span>
				<span class='text'>S</span>
				<span class='text'> ''John Dryden'', 305-06&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the same essay, Eliot accused Dryden of having a &quot;commonplace mind</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Critical interest in Dryden has increased recently, but, as a relatively straightforward writer ([[William Empson]], another modern admirer of Dryden, compared his &quot;flat&quot; use of language with Donne's interest in the &quot;echoes and recesses of words&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Seven Types of Ambiguity, Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;) his work has not occasioned as much interest as [[Andrew Marvell]]'s or [[John Donne]]'s or Pope's</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;===Translation style===While Dryden had many admirers, he also had his share of critics, [[Mark Van Doren]] among them</span>
				<span class='text'> Doren complained that in translating Vergil's ''Aeneid'', Dryden had added &quot;a fund of phrases with which he could expand any passage that seemed to him curt&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> Dryden did not feel such expansion was a fault, arguing that as Latin is a naturally concise language it cannot be duly represented by a comparable number of words in English</span>
				<span class='text'> &quot;He</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ecognized that Vergil 'had the advantage of a language wherein much may be comprehended in a little space' (5:329‚Äì30)</span>

				<span class='text'> In line 790 the literal translation of &quot;haec ubi dicta dedit‚Äù is &quot;when she gave these words</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù  But &quot;she said‚Äù gets the point across, uses half the words, and makes for better English</span>
				<span class='text'> A few lines later, with &quot;ter conatus ibi collo dare bracchia circum; ter frustra comprensa manus effugit imago&quot;, he alters the literal translation &quot;Thrice trying to give arms around her neck; thrice the image grasped in vain fled the hands&quot;, in order to fit it into meter and the emotion of the scene</span>
				<span class='text'>n his own words,&lt;blockquote&gt;The way I have taken, is not so streight as Metaphrase, nor so loose as Paraphrase: Some things too I have omitted, and sometimes added of my own</span>
				<span class='text'> Yet the omissions I hope, are but of Circumstances, and such as wou'd have no grace in English; and the Addition, I also hope, are easily deduc'd from Virgil's Sense</span>
				<span class='text'> They will seem (at least I have the Vanity to think so), not struck into him, but growing out of him</span>
