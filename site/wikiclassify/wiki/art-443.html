				<span class='text'>In the United Kingdom he directed three films, beginning with ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'' (1965)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1968 he moved to the United States and cemented his status by directing the horror film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), for which [[Ruth Gordon]] won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress</span>

				<span class='text'>The following year he went to Italy to make ''[[What? (film)|What?]]'' (1973) and subsequently spent the next five years living near Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he travelled to Hollywood to direct ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974)</span>

				<span class='text'>Polanski, who was then hiding from the Germans, remembered seeing his father being marched off with a long line of people</span>
				<span class='text'>Polanski tried getting closer to his father to ask him what was happening, and managed to get within a few yards</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Freer&quot; /&gt; Author [[Ian Freer]] concludes that his constant childhood fears and dread of violence have contributed to the &quot;tangible atmospheres he conjures up on film</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Freer&quot; /&gt;By the time the war ended in 1945, a [[Poland#World War II|fifth of the Polish population]] had been killed,&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot; /&gt; with the vast majority of the victims being civilians</span>

				<span class='text'>His father remarried 21 December 1946 to Wanda Zajączkowska (a woman Polanski had never liked) and died of cancer in 1984</span>
				<span class='text'>Time repaired the family contacts; Polanski visited them in Kraków, and relatives visited him in Hollywood and Paris</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;polanski1&quot; /&gt;=== Introduction to movies ===Polanski's fascination with cinema began very early, when he was around age four or five</span>
				<span class='text'>He recalls this period in an interview:{{Quote|Even as a child, I always loved cinema and was thrilled when my parents would take me before the war</span>
				<span class='text'>Then we were put into the ghetto in Krakòw and there was no cinema, but the Germans often showed newsreels to the people outside the ghetto, on a screen in the market place</span>
				<span class='text'>And there was one particular corner where you could see the screen through the barbed wire</span>
				<span class='text'>I remember watching with fascination, although all they were showing was the German army and German tanks, with occasional anti-Jewish slogans inserted on cards</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;playboy&quot;/&gt;}}After the war, he watched films, either at school or at a local cinema, using whatever pocket money he had</span>
				<span class='text'>Polanski writes, &quot;Most of this went on the movies, but movie seats were dirt cheap, so a little went a long way</span>
				<span class='text'>I lapped up every kind of film</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;polanski2&quot; /&gt; As time went on, movies became more than an escape into entertainment, as he explains:{{Quote|Movies were becoming an absolute obsession with me</span>
				<span class='text'>I was enthralled by everything connected with the cinema—not just the movies themselves but the aura that surrounded them</span>
				<span class='text'>I loved the luminous rectangle of the screen, the sight of the beam slicing through the darkness from the projection booth, the miraculous synchronization of sound and vision, even the dusty smell of the tip-up seats</span>
				<span class='text'>More than anything else though, I was fascinated by the actual mechanics of the process</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Polanski's star on the [[Łódź]] walk of fame]]Polanski attended the [[National Film School in Łódź]], the third-largest city in Poland</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Łódź&quot;/&gt; In the 1950s, Polanski took up acting, appearing in [[Andrzej Wajda]]'s ''[[Pokolenie]]'' (''A Generation'', 1954) and in the same year in Silik Sternfeld's ''[[Zaczarowany rower]]'' (''Enchanted Bicycle'' or ''Magical Bicycle'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Polanski's directorial debut was also in 1955 with a short film ''Rower'' (''Bicycle'')</span>
				<span class='text'>''Rower'' is a semi-autobiographical feature film, believed to be lost, which also starred Polanski</span>
				<span class='text'>It refers to his real-life violent altercation with a notorious Kraków felon, Janusz Dziuba, who arranged to sell Polanski a bicycle, but instead beat him badly and stole his money</span>
				<span class='text'>In real life, the offender was arrested while fleeing after fracturing Polanski's skull, and executed for three murders, out of eight prior such assaults which he had committed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;thesmokinggun&quot; /&gt; Several other short films made during his study at Łódź gained him considerable recognition, particularly ''[[Two Men and a Wardrobe]]'' (1958) and ''[[When Angels Fall]]'' (1959)</span>

				<span class='text'>l |accessdate=2014-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Knife in the Water'' is about a wealthy, unhappily married couple who decide to take a mysterious hitchhiker with them on a weekend boating excursion</span>
				<span class='text'>A dark and unsettling work, Polanski's debut feature subtly evinces a profound pessimism about human relationships with regard to the psychological dynamics and moral consequences of status envy and sexual jealousy</span>
				<span class='text'>''Knife in the Water'' was a major commercial success in the West and gave Polanski an international reputation</span>
				<span class='text'>The film also earned its director his first Academy Award nomination (Best Foreign Language Film) in 1963</span>
				<span class='text'>Leon Niemczyk, who played Andrzej, was the only professional actor in the film</span>
				<span class='text'>Jolanta Umecka, who played Krystyna, was discovered by Polanski at a swimming pool</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;california1&quot;/&gt;Polanski left then-communist Poland and moved to France, where he had already made two notable short films in 1961: ''[[The Fat and the Lean]]'' and ''[[Ssaki|Mammals]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>While in France, Polanski contributed one segment (&quot;La rivière de diamants&quot;) to the French-produced omnibus film, ''[[Les plus belles escroqueries du monde]]'' (English title: ''The Beautiful Swindlers'') in 1964</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Polanski found that in the early 1960s, the French film industry was xenophobic and generally unwilling to support a rising filmmaker of foreign origin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;mississippi&quot;/&gt;; ''Repulsion'' (1965)Polanski made three feature films in England, based on original scripts written by himself and [[Gérard Brach]], a frequent collaborator</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'' (1965) is a psychological horror film focusing on a young [[Belgians|Belgian]] woman named Carol ([[Catherine Deneuve]]), who is living in London with her older sister ([[Yvonne Furneaux]])</span>
				<span class='text'>The film's themes, situations, visual motifs, and effects clearly reflect the influence of early [[surrealist]] cinema as well as horror movies of the 1950s—particularly [[Luis Buñuel]]'s ''[[Un chien Andalou]]'', [[Jean Cocteau]]'s ''[[The Blood of a Poet]]'', [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]]'s ''[[Les Diaboliques (film)|Diabolique]]'' and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Cul-de-sac'' (1966)''[[Cul-de-sac (1966 film)|Cul-de-sac]]'' (1966) is a bleak [[nihilism|nihilist]] [[tragicomedy]] filmed on location in [[Northumberland]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The tone and premise of the film owe a great deal to [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', along with aspects of [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]''</span>
				<span class='text'> ''The Fearless Vampire Killers/Dance of the Vampires'' (1967)''[[The Fearless Vampire Killers]]'' (1967) (known by its original title, &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot; in most countries outside the United States) is a parody of vampire films</span>
				<span class='text'>The plot concerns a buffoonish professor and his clumsy assistant, Alfred (played by Polanski), who are traveling through [[Transylvania]] in search of vampires</span>
				<span class='text'>The ironic and macabre ending is considered classic Polanski</span>
