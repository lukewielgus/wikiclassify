				<span class='text'>1430) was an [[Italian French]] late medieval author</span>
				<span class='text'>She served as a court writer for several dukes ([[Louis I, Duke of Orl√©ans|Louis of Orleans]], [[Philip the Bold]] of Burgundy, and [[John the Fearless]] of Burgundy) and the French royal court during the reign of [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She wrote both poetry and prose works such as biographies and books containing practical advice for women</span>
				<span class='text'>She completed forty-one works during her 30-year career from 1399‚Äì1429</span>

				<span class='text'>Reclaiming Rhetorica: Women and in the Rhetorical Tradition (Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1995), p</span>
				<span class='text'>74&lt;/ref&gt;  She married in 1380 at the age of 15, and was widowed 10 years later</span>
				<span class='text'>Much of the impetus for her writing came from her need to earn a living to support her mother, a niece and her two surviving children</span>
				<span class='text'> She spent most of her childhood and all of her adult life in Paris and then the abbey at [[Poissy]], and wrote entirely in her adopted language, [[Middle French]]</span>
				<span class='text'>er early courtly poetry is marked by her knowledge of aristocratic custom and fashion of the day, particularly involving women and the practice of [[chivalry]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Her early and later allegorical and didactic treatises reflect both autobiographical information about her life and views and also her own individualized and humanist approach to the scholastic learned tradition of mythology, legend, and history she inherited from clerical scholars and to the genres and courtly or scholastic subjects of contemporary French and Italian poets she admired</span>
				<span class='text'>Supported and encouraged by important royal French and English patrons, she influenced 15th-century English poetry</span>
				<span class='text'> Her success stems from a wide range of innovative writing and rhetorical techniques that critically challenged renowned writers such as [[Jean de Meun]], author of the ''[[Romance of the Rose]]'', which she criticized as immoral</span>
				<span class='text'>n recent decades, Christine de Pizan's work has been returned to prominence by the efforts of scholars such as Charity Cannon Willard, Earl Jeffrey Richards and [[Simone de Beauvoir]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Certain scholars have argued that she should be seen as an early [[feminist]] who efficiently used language to convey that women could play an important role within society</span>
				<span class='text'>This characterization has been challenged by other critics, who say that it is either an anachronistic use of the word or a misinterpretation of her writing and intentions</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Life=={{French literature sidebar}}Christine de Pizan was born in 1364 in [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>She was the daughter of Tommaso di Benvenuto da Pizzano (Thomas de Pizan, named for the family's origins in the town of Pizzano, south east of Bologna), a physician, court astrologer, and Councillor of the [[Republic of Venice]]</span>

				<span class='text'>by Rosalind Brown-Grant (London: Penguin Books, 1999), introduction</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Following her birth, Thomas de Pizan accepted an appointment to the court of [[Charles V of France]], as the king‚Äôs [[astrologer]], [[Alchemy|alchemist]], and [[physician]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In this atmosphere, Christine was able to pursue her intellectual interests</span>
				<span class='text'>She successfully educated herself by immersing herself in languages, in the rediscovered classics and humanism of the early Renaissance, and in Charles V‚Äôs royal archive that housed a vast number of manuscripts</span>
				<span class='text'>But she did not assert her intellectual abilities, or establish her authority as a writer until she was widowed at the age of 25</span>

				<span class='text'>77</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;She married Etienne du Castel, a royal secretary to the court, at the age of 15</span>
				<span class='text'>She had three children, a daughter (who became a nun at the Dominican Abbey in Poissy in 1397 as a companion to the king's daughter, Marie), a son Jean, and another child who died in childhood</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Willard, p</span>
				<span class='text'>39&quot;/&gt; In order to support herself and her family, she turned to writing</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1393, she was writing love [[ballads]], which caught the attention of wealthy patrons within the court</span>
				<span class='text'>These patrons were intrigued by the novelty of a female writer and had her compose texts about their romantic exploits</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Redfern, p</span>
				<span class='text'>77&quot;/&gt; Her output during this period was prolific</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1393 and 1412, she composed over 300 ballads, and many more shorter poems</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|200px|Christine de Pizan presents her book to [[Isabeau of Bavaria]], Queen of France</span>
				<span class='text'>]Christine's participation in a literary debate, in 1401‚Äì1402, allowed her to move beyond the courtly circles, and ultimately to establish her status as a writer concerned with the position of women in society</span>
				<span class='text'>During these years, she involved herself in a renowned literary controversy, the ‚ÄúQuerelle du Roman de la Rose‚Äù</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Willard, p</span>
				<span class='text'>73</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She helped to instigate this debate by beginning to question the literary merits of Jean de Meun‚Äôs the ''[[Roman de la Rose|Romance of the Rose]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Written in the 13th century, the ''Romance of the Rose'' satirizes the conventions of courtly love while critically depicting women as nothing more than seducers</span>
				<span class='text'>Christine specifically objected to the use of vulgar terms in Jean de Meun‚Äôs allegorical poem</span>
				<span class='text'>She argued that these terms denigrated the proper and natural function of sexuality, and that such language was inappropriate for female characters such as [[Reason|Madame Raison]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to her, noble women did not use such language</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maureen Quilligan, The Allegory of Female Authority: Christine de Pizan's &quot;Cit√© des Dames&quot; (New York: Cornell University Press, 1991), p</span>
				<span class='text'>40</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Her critique primarily stems from her belief that Jean de Meun was purposely slandering women through the debated text</span>
				<span class='text'>he debate itself was extensive and at its end, the principal issue was no longer Jean de Meun‚Äôs literary capabilities</span>
				<span class='text'>The principal issue had shifted to the unjust slander of women within literary texts</span>
				<span class='text'>This dispute helped to establish Christine's reputation as a female intellectual who could assert herself effectively and defend her claims in the male-dominated literary realm</span>
				<span class='text'>She continued to counter abusive literary treatments of women</span>
				<span class='text'>=Works==Christine produced a large amount of vernacular works, in both prose and verse</span>
				<span class='text'>Her works include political treatises, [[mirrors for princes]], epistles, and poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>y 1405, Christine had completed her most famous literary works, ''[[The Book of the City of Ladies]]'' and ''[[The Treasure of the City of Ladies]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The first of these shows the importance of women‚Äôs past contributions to society, and the second strives to teach women of all estates how to cultivate useful qualities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Willard 1984, p</span>
				<span class='text'>135&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one section of the book tells wives: &quot;If she wants to act prudently and have the praise of both the world and her husband, she will be cheerful to him all the time&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cantor, Norman</span>
				<span class='text'>The Medieval Reader</span>
				<span class='text'>p</span>
				<span class='text'>230&lt;/ref&gt;In ''The Book of the City of Ladies'' Christine created a symbolic city in which women are appreciated and defended</span>
				<span class='text'>She constructed three allegorical figures - Reason, Justice, and Rectitude - in the common pattern of literature in that era, when many books and poetry utilized stock allegorical figures to express ideas or emotions</span>
				<span class='text'>She enters into a dialogue, a movement between question and answer, with these allegorical figures that is from a completely female perspective</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p</span>
				<span class='text'>6&lt;/ref&gt;  Together, they create a forum to speak on issues of consequence to all women</span>
				<span class='text'>Only female voices, examples and opinions provide evidence within this text</span>
				<span class='text'>Christine, through Lady Reason in particular, argues that stereotypes of women can be sustained only if women are prevented from entering into the conversation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, she hoped to establish truths about women that contradicted the negative stereotypes that she had identified in previous literature</span>
				<span class='text'>n ''The Treasure of the City of Ladies'', she highlights the persuasive effect of women‚Äôs speech and actions in everyday life</span>
				<span class='text'>In this particular text, Christine argues that women must recognize and promote their ability to make peace between people</span>
				<span class='text'>This ability will allow women to mediate between husband and subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>She also argues that slanderous speech erodes one‚Äôs honor and threatens the sisterly bond among women</span>
				<span class='text'>Christine then argues that &quot;skill in discourse should be a part of every woman‚Äôs moral repertoire&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Redfern, p</span>
				<span class='text'>87&lt;/ref&gt; She believed that a woman‚Äôs influence is realized when her speech accords value to chastity, virtue, and restraint</span>
				<span class='text'>She argued that rhetoric is a powerful tool that women could employ to settle differences and to assert themselves</span>
				<span class='text'> The ''Treasure of the City of Ladies'' provides glimpses into women's lives in 1400, from the great lady in the castle down to the merchant's wife, the servant, and the peasant</span>
				<span class='text'>She offers advice to governesses, widows, and even prostitutes</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|reason=It would be nice to have a direct quote on this</span>
				<span class='text'>date=May 2014}}De Pizan was greatly interested in history, ranging from the [[Matter of Troy]] to the &quot;founding of the royal house of France&quot; (for her the latter was a consequence of the former)</span>
				<span class='text'>She obtained her knowledge of Troy from the ''[[Histoire ancienne jusqu'√† C√©sar]]'', and chose an anti-Trojan position</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Hector]] especially served as a model and a measure of masculinity for her</span>

				<span class='text'>1475]]Her final work was a poem eulogizing [[Joan of Arc]], the peasant girl who said God had commanded her to secure the French throne for Charles VII</span>
				<span class='text'>Written in 1429, ''The Poem of Joan of Arc'' (&quot;Ditie de Jehanne dArc&quot;) celebrates the appearance of a woman whom Christine describes in the poem as &quot;a simple shepherdess&quot; while commenting: &quot;It is a fact well worth remembering That God should now have wished (and this is the truth!) to bestow such great blessings on France, through a young virgin&quot;, adding &quot;For there will be a King of France called Charles [VII], son of Charles [VI], who will be supreme ruler over all Kings</span>
