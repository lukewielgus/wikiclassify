				<span class='text'>--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OSNS&quot;/&gt;) was an English [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] (described in his own day as a &quot;[[Natural philosophy|natural philosopher]]&quot;) who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and as a key figure in the [[scientific revolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'> His book ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (&quot;Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy&quot;), first published in 1687, laid the foundations for [[classical mechanics]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Newton made seminal contributions to [[optics]], and he shares credit with [[Gottfried Leibniz]] for the development of [[calculus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ewton's ''Principia'' formulated the [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal gravitation]], which dominated scientists' view of the physical universe for the next three centuries</span>
				<span class='text'> By deriving [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] from his mathematical description of gravity, and then using the same principles to account for the trajectories of [[comet]]s, the [[tide]]s, the [[Axial precession|precession of the equinoxes]], and other phenomena, Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the Solar System</span>
				<span class='text'>This work also demonstrated that the [[Dynamics (mechanics)|motion of objects]] on Earth and of [[celestial mechanics|celestial]] bodies could be described by the same principles</span>
				<span class='text'> His prediction that Earth should be shaped as an [[oblate spheroid]] was later vindicated by the measurements of [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertuis]], [[Charles Marie de La Condamine|La Condamine]], and others, which helped convince most [[Continental Europe]]an scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over the earlier system of [[René Descartes|Descartes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ewton built the first practical [[reflecting telescope]] and developed a [[Theory of Colours|theory of colour]] based on the observation that a [[Dispersive prism|prism]] decomposes white light into the many colours of the [[visible spectrum]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He formulated an [[Newton's law of cooling|empirical law of cooling]], studied the [[speed of sound]], and introduced the notion of a [[Newtonian fluid]]</span>
				<span class='text'> In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of [[power series]], generalised the [[binomial theorem]] to non-integer exponents, developed a [[Newton's method|method]] for approximating the [[Zero of a function|roots of a function]], and classified most of the [[cubic plane curve]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>ewton was a fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] and the second [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]</span>
				<span class='text'> He was a devout but unorthodox Christian and, unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty of the day, he refused to take [[holy orders]] in the [[Church of England]], perhaps because he privately rejected the doctrine of the [[Trinity]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences, Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of [[Chronology of the Bible|biblical chronology]] and [[alchemy]], but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>In his later life, Newton became president of the [[Royal Society]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Newton served the British government as Warden and Master of the [[Royal Mint]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He was removed from school, and by October 1659, he was to be found at [[Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth]], where his mother, widowed for a second time, attempted to make a farmer of him</span>
				<span class='text'>Newton hated farming</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Westfall|1994|pp=16–19}} Henry Stokes, master at the King's School, persuaded his mother to send him back to school so that he might complete his education</span>
				<span class='text'>Motivated partly by a desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the top-ranked student,{{sfn|White|1997|p=22}} distinguishing himself mainly by building sundials and models of windmills</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Westfall|1980|pp=60–62}}In June 1661, he was admitted to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], on the recommendation of his uncle Rev William Ayscough</span>
				<span class='text'>He started as a [[subsizar]]—paying his way by performing [[valet]]'s duties—until he was awarded a scholarship in 1664, which guaranteed him four more years until he would get his M</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Westfall|1980|pp=71,103}} At that time, the college's teachings were based on those of [[Aristotle]], whom Newton supplemented with modern philosophers such as [[René Descartes|Descartes]], and [[astronomers]] such as [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Thomas Street]], through whom he learned of [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s work</span>
				<span class='text'>He set down in his notebook a series of '[[Quaestiones quaedam philosophicae|Quaestiones]]' about mechanical philosophy as he found it</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Westfall|1980|pp=330–1}} Nevertheless, Newton managed to avoid it by means of a special permission from [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] (see &quot;Middle years&quot; section below)</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>but of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things</span>
				<span class='text'>}}Newton later became involved in a dispute with [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] over priority in the development of calculus (the [[Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed [[calculus]] independently, although with very different notations</span>
				<span class='text'>Occasionally it has been suggested that Newton published almost nothing about it until 1693, and did not give a full account until 1704, while Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684</span>
				<span class='text'>(Leibniz's notation and &quot;differential Method&quot;, nowadays recognised as much more convenient notations, were adopted by continental European mathematicians, and after 1820 or so, also by British mathematicians</span>
				<span class='text'> Such a suggestion, however, fails to notice the content of calculus which critics of Newton's time and modern times have pointed out in [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica#Book 1, De motu corporum|Book 1]] of Newton's ''Principia'' itself (published 1687) and in its forerunner manuscripts, such as ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]'' (&quot;On the motion of bodies in orbit&quot;), of 1684</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' is not written in the language of calculus either as we know it or as Newton's (later) 'dot' notation would write it</span>
				<span class='text'>His work extensively uses calculus in geometric form based on limiting values of the ratios of vanishing small quantities: in the ''Principia'' itself, Newton gave demonstration of this under the name of 'the method of first and last ratios'&lt;ref&gt;Newton, 'Principia', 1729 English translation, [https://books</span>
				<span class='text'>oogle</span>
				<span class='text'>om/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA41 at page 41]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and explained why he put his expositions in this form,&lt;ref&gt;Newton, 'Principia', 1729 English translation, [https://books</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; remarking also that 'hereby the same thing is performed as by the method of indivisibles'</span>
				<span class='text'>ecause of this, the ''Principia'' has been called &quot;a book dense with the theory and application of the infinitesimal calculus&quot; in modern times&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Truesdell, ''Essays in the History of Mechanics'' (Berlin, 1968), at p</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Newton had been reluctant to publish his calculus because he feared controversy and criticism</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Stewart|2009|p=107}} He was close to the Swiss mathematician [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1691, Duillier started to write a new version of Newton's ''Principia'', and corresponded with Leibniz</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Westfall|1980|pp=538–539}} In 1693, the relationship between Duillier and Newton deteriorated and the book was never completed</span>
				<span class='text'>tarting in 1699, other members of the [[Royal Society]] (of which Newton was a member) accused Leibniz of [[plagiarism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true discoverer and labelled Leibniz a fraud</span>
				<span class='text'>This study was cast into doubt when it was later found that Newton himself wrote the study's concluding remarks on Leibniz</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus began the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the latter's death in 1716</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ball|1908|pp=356ff}}Newton is generally credited with the [[Binomial theorem#Newton's generalised binomial theorem|generalised binomial theorem]], valid for any exponent</span>
				<span class='text'>He discovered [[Newton's identities]], [[Newton's method]], classified [[cubic plane curve]]s ([[polynomials]] of degree three in two [[variable (mathematics)|variables]]), made substantial contributions to the theory of [[finite differences]], and was the first to use fractional indices and to employ [[coordinate geometry]] to derive solutions to [[Diophantine equations]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He approximated partial sums of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]] by [[logarithms]] (a precursor to [[Euler's summation formula]]) and was the first to use [[power series]] with confidence and to revert power series</span>

				<span class='text'>he ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' was published on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from [[Edmond Halley]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In this work, Newton stated the three universal laws of motion</span>
				<span class='text'>Together, these laws describe the relationship between any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for [[classical mechanics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>They contributed to many advances during the [[Industrial Revolution]] which soon followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of these advancements continue to be the underpinnings of non-relativistic technologies in the modern world</span>
				<span class='text'>He used the Latin word ''gravitas'' (weight) for the effect that would become known as [[gravity]], and defined the law of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal gravitation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n the same work, Newton presented a calculus-like method of geometrical analysis using 'first and last ratios', gave the first analytical determination (based on [[Boyle's law]]) of the speed of sound in air, inferred the oblateness of Earth's spheroidal figure, accounted for the precession of the equinoxes as a result of the Moon's gravitational attraction on the Earth's oblateness, initiated the gravitational study of the [[Lunar theory#Newton|irregularities in the motion of the moon]], provided a theory for the determination of the orbits of comets, and much more</span>

				<span class='text'> He also divided them into four types, satisfying different equations, and in 1717 [[James Stirling (mathematician)|Stirling]], probably with Newton's help, proved that every cubic was one of these four types</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|White|1997|p=86}} Although it has been said that the apple story is a myth and that he did not arrive at his theory of gravity in any single moment,&lt;ref name=&quot;Berkun2010&quot;/&gt; acquaintances of Newton (such as [[William Stukeley]], whose manuscript account of 1752 has been made available by the Royal Society) do in fact confirm the incident, though not the cartoon version that the apple actually hit Newton's head</span>
				<span class='text'>Stukeley recorded in his ''Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton's Life'' a conversation with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726:&lt;ref name=&quot;Newton's apple: The real story&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamblyn (2011)&quot;/&gt;{{Quotation|we went into the garden, &amp; drank thea under the shade of some appletrees; only he, &amp; my self</span>
				<span class='text'>amidst other discourse, he told me, he was just in the same situation, as when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground,&quot; thought he to himself; occasion'd by the fall of an apple, as he sat in a contemplative mood</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;why should it not go sideways, or upwards? but constantly to the earths center? assuredly, the reason is, that the earth draws it</span>
				<span class='text'>there must be a drawing power in matter</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp; the sum of the drawing power in the matter of the earth must be in the earths center, not in any side of the earth</span>
				<span class='text'>therefore dos this apple fall perpendicularly, or toward the center</span>
				<span class='text'>if matter thus draws matter; it must be in proportion of its quantity</span>
				<span class='text'>therefore the apple draws the earth, as well as the earth draws the apple</span>

				<span class='text'>:Conduitt's account of Newton's life at Cambridge&quot;/&gt;{{Quotation|In the year 1666 he retired again from Cambridge to his mother in Lincolnshire</span>
				<span class='text'>Whilst he was pensively meandering in a garden it came into his thought that the power of gravity (which brought an apple from a tree to the ground) was not limited to a certain distance from earth, but that this power must extend much further than was usually thought</span>
				<span class='text'>Why not as high as the Moon said he to himself &amp; if so, that must influence her motion &amp; perhaps retain her in her orbit, whereupon he fell a calculating what would be the effect of that supposition</span>
				<span class='text'>}In similar terms, [[Voltaire]] wrote in his ''Essay on Epic Poetry'' (1727), &quot;Sir Isaac Newton walking in his gardens, had the first thought of his system of gravitation, upon seeing an apple falling from a tree</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;It is known from his notebooks that Newton was grappling in the late 1660s with the idea that terrestrial gravity extends, in an inverse-square proportion, to the Moon; however it took him two decades to develop the full-fledged theory</span>

				<span class='text'>''The Cambridge Companion to Newton'' (2002) p</span>
				<span class='text'>6&lt;/ref&gt; The question was not whether gravity existed, but whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be the force holding the Moon to its orbit</span>
				<span class='text'>Newton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance, one could indeed calculate the Moon's orbital period, and get good agreement</span>
				<span class='text'>He guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named it &quot;universal gravitation&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>arious trees are claimed to be &quot;the&quot; apple tree which Newton describes</span>
				<span class='text'>The King's School, Grantham, claims that the tree was purchased by the school, uprooted and transported to the headmaster's garden some years later</span>
				<span class='text'>The staff of the [now] [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]-owned [[Woolsthorpe Manor]] dispute this, and claim that a tree present in their gardens is the one described by Newton</span>

				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OSNS&quot;&gt;During Newton's lifetime, two calendars were in use in Europe: the [[Julian Calendar|Julian]] (&quot;[[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]&quot;) calendar in [[protestant]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] regions, including Britain; and the [[Gregorian Calendar|Gregorian]] (&quot;[[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]]&quot;) calendar in Roman Catholic Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>At Newton's birth, Gregorian dates were ten days ahead of Julian dates: thus his birth is recorded as taking place on 25 December 1642 Old Style, but can be converted to a New Style (modern) date of 4 January 1643</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time of his death, the difference between the calendars had increased to eleven days: moreover, he died in the period after the start of the New Style year on 1 January, but before that of the Old Style new year on 25 March</span>
				<span class='text'>His death occurred on 20 March 1726 according to the Old Style calendar, but the year is usually adjusted to 1727</span>
				<span class='text'>A full conversion to New Style gives the date 31 March 1727</span>
