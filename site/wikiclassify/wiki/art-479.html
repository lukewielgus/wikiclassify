				<span class='text'>vg}}'''Susan Brownell Anthony''' (February 15, 1820 – March 13, 1906) was an [[United States|American]] social reformer and feminist who played a pivotal role in the [[women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] movement</span>
				<span class='text'> Born into a [[Quaker]] family committed to social equality, she collected [[anti-slavery movement|anti-slavery]] petitions at the age of 17</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1856, she became the New York state agent for the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1851, she met [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who became her lifelong friend and co-worker in social reform activities, primarily in the field of [[women's rights]]</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1852, they founded the New York Women's State Temperance Society after Anthony was prevented from speaking at a [[temperance movement in the United States|temperance]] conference because she was a woman</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1863, they founded the [[Women's Loyal National League]], which conducted the largest petition drive in the nation's history up to that time, collecting nearly 400,000 signatures in support of the abolition of slavery</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1866, they initiated the [[American Equal Rights Association]], which campaigned for equal rights for both women and African Americans</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1868, they began publishing a women's rights newspaper called ''[[The Revolution (newspaper)|The Revolution]]''</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1869, they founded the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] as part of a split in the women's movement</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1890 the split was formally healed when their organization merged with the rival [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] to form the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]], with Anthony as its key force</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1876, Anthony and Stanton began working with [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]] on what eventually grew into the six-volume ''[[History of Woman Suffrage]]''</span>
				<span class='text'> The interests of Anthony and Stanton diverged somewhat in later years, but the two remained close friends</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1872, Anthony was arrested for voting in her hometown of [[Rochester, New York]], and convicted in a widely publicized trial</span>
				<span class='text'> Although she refused to pay the fine, the authorities declined to take further action</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1878, Anthony and Stanton arranged for Congress to be presented with an amendment giving women the right to vote</span>
				<span class='text'> Popularly known as the Anthony Amendment and introduced by Sen</span>
				<span class='text'> Aaron A</span>
				<span class='text'>Sargent (R-CA), it became the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment to the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Constitution]] in 1920</span>
				<span class='text'>nthony traveled extensively in support of women's suffrage, giving as many as 75 to 100 speeches per year and working on many state campaigns</span>
				<span class='text'> She worked internationally for women's rights, playing a key role in creating the [[International Council of Women]], which is still active</span>
				<span class='text'> She also helped to bring about the [[World's Congress of Representative Women]] at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago in 1893</span>
				<span class='text'>hen she first began campaigning for women's rights, Anthony was harshly ridiculed and accused of trying to destroy the institution of marriage</span>
				<span class='text'> Public perception of her changed radically during her lifetime, however</span>
				<span class='text'> Her 80th birthday was celebrated in the White House at the invitation of President [[William McKinley]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;As several others in that group were already doing, the Anthony family began to attend services at the [[First Unitarian Church of Rochester]], which was associated with social reform</span>
				<span class='text'> A women's rights convention was held at that church in 1848, inspired by the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first women's rights convention, which was held two weeks earlier in a nearby town</span>

				<span class='text'>The NWSA was politically independent, but the AWSA at least initially aimed for close ties with the Republican Party, hoping that the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment would lead to a Republican push for women's suffrage</span>
				<span class='text'> The NWSA focused primarily on winning suffrage at the national level while the AWSA pursued a state-by-state strategy</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;DuBois (1978), pp</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Events soon removed much of the basis for the split in the women's movement</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1870, debate about the Fifteenth Amendment was made irrelevant when that amendment was officially ratified</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1872, disgust with corruption in government led to a mass defection of abolitionists and other social reformers from the Republicans to the short-lived [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]]</span>

				<span class='text'>264–265&lt;/ref&gt; The rivalry between the two women's groups was so bitter, however, that a merger proved to be impossible for twenty years</span>
