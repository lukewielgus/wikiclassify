				<span class='text'>Long before Saddam, Iraq had been split along social, ethnic, religious, and economic fault lines: Sunni versus [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]], Arab versus [[Kurds|Kurd]], tribal chief versus urban merchant, nomad versus peasant</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Humphreys, 78&quot;&gt;Humphreys, 78&lt;/ref&gt; The desire for stable rule in a country rife with [[Political faction|factionalism]] led Saddam to pursue both massive repression and the improvement of living standards</span>

				<span class='text'>Ever concerned with broadening his base of support among the diverse elements of Iraqi society and mobilizing mass support, he closely followed the administration of state welfare and development programs</span>
				<span class='text'>t the center of this strategy was Iraq's oil</span>
				<span class='text'>On 1 June 1972, Saddam oversaw the seizure of international oil interests, which, at the time, dominated the country's oil sector</span>
				<span class='text'>A year later, world oil prices rose dramatically as a result of the [[1973 energy crisis]], and skyrocketing revenues enabled Saddam to expand his agenda</span>

				<span class='text'>The influence of revolutionary Shi'ite Islam grew apace in the region, particularly in countries with large Shi'ite populations, especially Iraq</span>
				<span class='text'>Saddam feared that radical Islamic ideas—hostile to his secular rule—were rapidly spreading inside his country among the majority Shi'ite population</span>
				<span class='text'>here had also been bitter enmity between Saddam and Khomeini since the 1970s</span>
				<span class='text'>Khomeini, having been exiled from Iran in 1964, took up residence in Iraq, at the Shi'ite holy city of [[An Najaf]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There he involved himself with Iraqi Shi'ites and developed a strong, worldwide religious and political following against the Iranian Government, whom Saddam tolerated</span>
				<span class='text'>However, when Khomeini began to urge the Shi'ites there to overthrow Saddam and under pressure from the Shah, who had agreed to a rapprochement between Iraq and Iran in 1975, Saddam agreed to expel Khomeini in 1978 to France</span>
				<span class='text'>However this turned out to be an imminent failure and a political catalyst, for Khomeini had access to more media connections and also collaborated with a much larger Iranian community under his support whom he used to his advantage</span>
				<span class='text'>fter Khomeini gained power, skirmishes between Iraq and revolutionary Iran occurred for ten months over the sovereignty of the disputed [[Shatt al-Arab]] waterway, which divides the two countries</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period, Saddam Hussein publicly maintained that it was in Iraq's interest not to engage with Iran, and that it was in the interests of both nations to maintain peaceful relations</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in a private meeting with Salah Omar al-Ali, Iraq's permanent ambassador to [[United Nations|the United Nations]], he revealed that he intended to invade and occupy a large part of Iran within months</span>
				<span class='text'>Later (probably to appeal for support from the United States and most Western nations), he would make toppling the Islamic government one of his intentions as well</span>

				<span class='text'>With the support of the Arab states, the United States, and Europe, and heavily financed by the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Saddam Hussein had become &quot;the defender of the Arab world&quot; against a revolutionary Iran</span>
				<span class='text'>The only exception was the Soviet Union, who initially refused to supply Iraq on the basis of neutrality in the conflict, although in his memoirs, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] claimed that [[Leonid Brezhnev]] refused to aid Saddam over infuriation of Saddam's treatment of Iraqi communists</span>

				<span class='text'>The southern, oil rich and prosperous Khuzestan and Basra area (the main focus of the war, and the primary source of their economies) were almost completely destroyed and were left at the pre 1979 border, while Iran managed to make some small gains on its borders in the Northern Kurdish area</span>
				<span class='text'>Both economies, previously healthy and expanding, were left in ruins</span>
				<span class='text'>addam borrowed tens of billions of dollars from other Arab states and a few billions from elsewhere during the 1980s to fight Iran, mainly to prevent the expansion of Shiite radicalism</span>
				<span class='text'>However, this had proven to completely backfire both on Iraq and on the part of the Arab states, for Khomeini was widely perceived as a hero for managing to defend Iran and maintain the war with little foreign support against the heavily backed Iraq and only managed to boost Islamic radicalism not only within the Arab states, but within Iraq itself, creating new tensions between the Sunni Ba'ath Party and the majority Shiite population</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Humphreys, 105&quot;&gt;Humphreys, 105&lt;/ref&gt;Saddam pushed oil-exporting countries to raise oil prices by cutting back production; Kuwait refused, however</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to refusing the request, Kuwait spearheaded the opposition in [[OPEC]] to the cuts that Saddam had requested</span>
				<span class='text'>Kuwait was pumping large amounts of oil, and thus keeping prices low, when Iraq needed to sell high-priced oil from its wells to pay off a huge debt</span>
				<span class='text'>addam had always argued that Kuwait was historically an integral part of Iraq, and that Kuwait had only come into being through the maneuverings of British imperialism; this echoed a belief that Iraqi nationalists had voiced for the past 50 years</span>

				<span class='text'>On 4 August an Iraqi-backed &quot;[[Republic of Kuwait|Provisional Government of Free Kuwait]]&quot; was proclaimed, but a total lack of legitimacy and support for it led to an 8 August announcement of a &quot;merger&quot; of the two countries</span>
				<span class='text'>On 28 August Kuwait formally became the 19th [[Governorates of Iraq|Governorate]] of Iraq</span>
				<span class='text'>Just two years after the 1988 Iraq and Iran truce, &quot;Saddam Hussein did what his Gulf patrons had earlier paid him to prevent</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Having removed the threat of Iranian fundamentalism he &quot;overran Kuwait and confronted his Gulf neighbors in the name of Arab nationalism and Islam</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PIRRR&quot; /&gt;When later asked why he invaded Kuwait, Saddam first claimed that it was because Kuwait was rightfully Iraq's 19th province and then said &quot;When I get something into my head I act</span>
				<span class='text'>That's just the way I am</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;economist2007&quot; /&gt; After Saddam's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, a UN coalition led by the United States drove Iraq's troops from Kuwait in February 1991</span>
				<span class='text'>The ability for Saddam Hussein to pursue such military aggression was from a &quot;military machine paid for in large part by the tens of billions of dollars Kuwait and the Gulf states had poured into Iraq and the weapons and technology provided by the Soviet Union, Germany, and France</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PIRRR&quot; /&gt;Shortly before he invaded Kuwait, he shipped 100 new [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] 200 Series cars to top editors in Egypt and Jordan</span>

				<span class='text'>officials feared Iraqi retaliation against oil-rich Saudi Arabia, since the 1940s a close ally of Washington, for the Saudis' opposition to the invasion of Kuwait</span>
				<span class='text'>Accordingly, the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and a group of allies, including countries as diverse as Egypt, Syria and [[Czechoslovakia]], deployed a massive amount of troops along the Saudi border with Kuwait and Iraq in order to encircle the Iraqi army, the largest in the Middle East</span>
				<span class='text'>addam's officers looted Kuwait, stripping even the marble from its palaces to move it to Saddam's own palace</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;economist2004&quot; /&gt;During the period of negotiations and threats following the invasion, Saddam focused renewed attention on the [[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] problem by promising to withdraw his forces from Kuwait if Israel would relinquish the occupied territories in the [[West Bank]], the [[Golan Heights]], and the [[Gaza Strip]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Saddam's proposal further split the Arab world, pitting U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> and Western-supported Arab states against the Palestinians</span>
				<span class='text'>The allies ultimately rejected any linkage between the Kuwait crisis and Palestinian issues</span>

				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2015}}On 6 March 1991, Bush announced &quot;What is at stake is more than one small country, it is a big idea—a [[New world order (politics)|new world order]], where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind: peace and security, freedom, and the rule of law</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}In the end, the out-numbered and under-equipped Iraqi army proved unable to compete on the battlefield with the highly mobile coalition land forces and their overpowering air support</span>
				<span class='text'>Some 175,000 Iraqis were taken prisoner and casualties were estimated at over 85,000</span>
				<span class='text'>As part of the cease-fire agreement, Iraq agreed to scrap all poison gas and [[biological warfare|germ weapons]] and allow UN observers to inspect the sites</span>
				<span class='text'>UN trade sanctions would remain in effect until Iraq complied with all terms</span>
				<span class='text'>Saddam publicly claimed victory at the end of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>=Postwar period=={{Main|1991 uprisings in Iraq}}Iraq's ethnic and religious divisions, together with the brutality of the conflict that this had engendered, laid the groundwork for postwar rebellions</span>
				<span class='text'>In the aftermath of the fighting, social and ethnic unrest among Shi'ite Muslims, Kurds, and dissident military units threatened the stability of Saddam's government</span>
				<span class='text'>Uprisings erupted in the Kurdish north and Shi'a southern and central parts of Iraq, but were ruthlessly repressed</span>
				<span class='text'>he United States, which had urged Iraqis to rise up against Saddam, did nothing to assist the rebellions</span>
				<span class='text'>The Iranians, despite the widespread Shi'ite rebellions, had no interest in provoking another war, while [[Turkey]] opposed any prospect of Kurdish independence, and the Saudis and other conservative Arab states feared an Iran-style Shi'ite revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>Saddam, having survived the immediate crisis in the wake of defeat, was left firmly in control of Iraq, although the country never recovered either economically or militarily from the Gulf War</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;PIRRR&quot; /&gt;Saddam routinely cited his survival as &quot;proof&quot; that Iraq had in fact won the war against the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>This message earned Saddam a great deal of popularity in many sectors of the Arab world</span>
				<span class='text'>John Esposito, however, claims that &quot;Arabs and Muslims were pulled in two directions</span>
				<span class='text'>That they rallied not so much to Saddam Hussein as to the bipolar nature of the confrontation (the West versus the Arab Muslim world) and the issues that Saddam proclaimed: Arab unity, self-sufficiency, and social justice</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; As a result, Saddam Hussein appealed to many people for the same reasons that attracted more and more followers to Islamic revivalism and also for the same reasons that fueled [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] feelings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;PIRRR&quot; /&gt;As one U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Muslim observer noted: &quot;People forgot about Saddam's record and concentrated on America&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Saddam Hussein might be wrong, but it is not America who should correct him</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; A shift was, therefore, clearly visible among many Islamic movements in the post war period &quot;from an initial Islamic ideological rejection of Saddam Hussein, the secular persecutor of Islamic movements, and his invasion of Kuwait to a more populist Arab nationalist, anti-imperialist support for Saddam (or more precisely those issues he represented or championed) and the condemnation of foreign intervention and occupation</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PIRRR&quot; /&gt;Saddam, therefore, increasingly portrayed himself as a devout Muslim, in an effort to co-opt the conservative religious segments of society</span>
				<span class='text'>Some elements of [[Sharia]] law were re-introduced, and the ritual phrase &quot;[[Allahu Akbar]]&quot; (&quot;God is great&quot;), in Saddam's handwriting, was added to the national flag</span>
				<span class='text'>Saddam also commissioned the production of a &quot;[[Blood Qur'an]]&quot;, written using 27 litres of his own blood, to thank God for saving him from various dangers and conspiracies</span>

				<span class='text'>Uday, while originally Saddam's favorite son and raised to succeed him he eventually fell out of favour with his father due to his erratic behavior; he was responsible for many car crashes and rapes around Baghdad, constant feuds with other members of his family, and killing his father's favorite valet and food taster [[Kamel Hana Gegeo]] at a party in Egypt honoring Egyptian first lady [[Suzanne Mubarak]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He became well known in the west for his involvement in looting Kuwait during the Gulf War, allegedly taking millions of dollars worth of gold, cars, and medical supplies (which were in short supply at the time) for himself and close supporters</span>
				<span class='text'>He was widely known for his paranoia and his obsession with torturing people who disappointed him in any way, which included tardy girlfriends, friends who disagreed with him and, most notoriously, Iraqi athletes who performed poorly</span>

				<span class='text'>He was second in command of the military (behind his father) and ran the elite [[Iraqi Republican Guard]] and the [[Iraqi Special Security Organization|SSO]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was believed to have ordered the army to kill thousands of rebelling [[Marsh Arabs]] and was instrumental in suppressing Shi'ite rebellions in the mid-1990s</span>
