				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt; From 977 to 997, he was a [[general]] under [[Roman I of Bulgaria]], the second surviving son of Emperor [[Peter I of Bulgaria]], and co-ruled with him, as Roman bestowed upon him the command of the army and the effective royal authority</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;One theory is that from 972/976 to 997 Samuel co-ruled with [[Roman I of Bulgaria]], who was the official tsar until 997, when he died in Byzantine captivity</span>
				<span class='text'>Roman is mentioned as tsar in several historical sources; for example the ''Annals'' by Yahya of [[Antioch]] call Roman &quot;Tsar&quot; and Samuel &quot;Roman's loyal military chief&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>However, other historians dispute this theory, as Roman was castrated and so technically could not have claimed the crown</span>
				<span class='text'>There was also a governor of Skopje called Roman who surrendered the city to the Byzantines in 1004, receiving the title of patrician from [[Basil II]] and becoming a Byzantine ''[[strategos]]'' in Abydus ([[John Skylitzes|Skylitzes]]-Cedr</span>
				<span class='text'>II, 455, 13), but this could be a mere coincidence of names</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As Samuel struggled to preserve his country's independence from the [[Byzantine Empire]], his rule was characterized by constant warfare against the Byzantines and their equally ambitious ruler [[Basil II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n his early years Samuel managed to inflict several major defeats on the Byzantines and to launch offensive campaigns into their territory</span>

				<span class='text'>]During the reign of [[Peter I of Bulgaria|emperor Peter I]], Bulgaria prospered in a long-lasting peace with Byzantium</span>

				<span class='text'>Since the beginning of the 9th century, the Bulgarian territory had stretched beyond the [[Carpathian Mountains]] as far as the [[Tisza]] River and the middle Danube</span>
				<span class='text'>During the reign of Samuel, the governor of these northwestern parts was duke [[Ahtum]], the grandson of duke [[Glad (duke)|Glad]], who had been defeated by the Hungarians in the 930s</span>
				<span class='text'>Ahtum commanded a strong army and firmly defended the northwestern borders of the Empire</span>
				<span class='text'>He also built many churches and monasteries through which he spread [[Christianity]] in [[Transylvania]]</span>

				<span class='text'>As a result of this conflict, the marriage between Gavril Radomir and the Hungarian princess was dissolved</span>
				<span class='text'>The Hungarians then attacked Ahtum, who had directly backed the pretenders for the Hungarian crown</span>
				<span class='text'>Stephen I convinced Hanadin, Ahtum's right-hand man, to help in the attack</span>

				<span class='text'>492–493</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a strong Byzantine army besieged Vidin, Ahtum's seat</span>
				<span class='text'>Although many soldiers were required to participate in the defense of the town, Ahtum was occupied with the war to the north</span>

				<span class='text'>Thus, the [[Russia]]n-born [[Yugoslavia]]n historian [[George Ostrogorsky]] distinguished Samuel's Empire from the Bulgarian Empire, referring to it as a &quot;Macedonian Empire&quot;, although he claims that it was politically and ecclesiastically a direct descendant of the empire of Simeon and Peter, and it was regarded by Samuel and the Byzantines as being the Bulgarian Empire itself</span>
