				<span class='text'> God had told Abraham to leave his country and kindred and go to a land that he would show him and promised to make of him a great nation bless him make his name great bless them that bless him and curse he who may curse him</span>
				<span class='text'> Abraham was 75 years old when he left Haran with his wife Sarai his nephew Lot and the substance and souls that they had acquired and traveled to  in </span>
				<span class='text'>There was a severe famine in the land of Canaan so that Abraham and Lot and their households traveled south to    northern   </span>
				<span class='text'>On the way Abraham told his wife Sarai to say that she was his sister so that the ians would not kill him</span>
				<span class='text'> When they entered Egypt the Pharaohs officials praised Sarais beauty to  and she was taken into his palace and Abraham was given provisions oxen and he asses and menservants and maidservants and she asses and camels</span>
				<span class='text'>However God afflicted Pharaoh and his household with great plagues for which he tried to find the reason</span>
				<span class='text'> Upon discovering that Sarai was a married woman Pharaoh demanded that they and their household leave immediately along with all their goods</span>
				<span class='text'>When they came back to the Bethel and Hai area Abrahams and Lots sizable livestock herds occupied the same pastures</span>
				<span class='text'>This became a problem for the herdsmen who were assigned to each familys cattle</span>
				<span class='text'>The conflicts between herdsmen had become so troublesome that Abraham graciously suggested that Lot choose a separate area either on the left hand north or on the right hand south that there be no conflict amongst brethren</span>
				<span class='text'>But Lot chose to go east to the plain of  where the land was well watered everywhere as far as Zoar and he dwelled in the cities of the plain toward </span>
				<span class='text'>Abraham went south to  and settled in the plain of  where he built another altar to worship </span>
				<span class='text'>During the rebellion of the  against   Abrahams nephew Lot was taken prisoner along with his entire household by the invading ite forces</span>
				<span class='text'>The Elamite army came to collect the spoils of war after having just defeated the king of Sodoms armies</span>
				<span class='text'> Lot and his family at the time were settled on the outskirts of the  which made them a visible target</span>
				<span class='text'>One person who escaped capture came and told Abraham what happened</span>
				<span class='text'>Once Abraham received this news he immediately assembled 318 trained servants</span>
				<span class='text'>Abrahams force headed north in pursuit of the Elamite army who were already worn down from the </span>
				<span class='text'>When they caught up with them at  Abraham devised a battle plan by splitting his group into more than one unit and launched a night raid</span>
				<span class='text'>Not only were they able to free the captives Abrahams unit chased and slaughtered the Elamite King  at Hobah just north of </span>
				<span class='text'>They freed Lot as well as his household and possessions and recovered all of the goods from Sodom that had been taken</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon Abrahams return Sodoms king came out to meet with him in the  the kings dale</span>
				<span class='text'>Also  king of Salem  a priest of  brought out bread and wine and blessed Abraham and God</span>
				<span class='text'>Abraham then gave Melchizedek a  of everything</span>
				<span class='text'>The king of Sodom then offered to let Abraham keep all the possessions if he would merely return his people</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he released the captives Abraham used any reward from the king of Sodom other than the share to which his allies were entitled</span>
				<span class='text'>The word of God came to Abraham in a vision and repeated the promise of the land and descendants as numerous as the stars</span>
				<span class='text'>Abraham and God made a covenant ceremony and God told of the future bondage of Israel in Egypt</span>
				<span class='text'>God described to Abraham the land that his offspring would claim the land of the Kenites Kenizzites Kadmonites Hittites Perizzites Rephaims Amorites Canaanites Girgashites and Jebusites</span>
				<span class='text'>Abraham and Sarai tried to make sense of how he would become a progenitor of nations since after 10 years of living in Canaan no child had been born</span>
				<span class='text'>Sarai then offered her Egyptian handmaiden  for Abraham to consort with so that he may have a child by her as his wife</span>
				<span class='text'>After Hagar found she was pregnant she began to despise her mistress Sarai</span>
				<span class='text'>Theore Sarai mistreated Hagar and Hagar fled away</span>
				<span class='text'>En route an angel spoke with Hagar at the fountain in the way to </span>
				<span class='text'>He instructed her to return and that her son would be a wild ass of a man his hand shall be against every man and every mans hand against him and he shall dwell in the face of all his brethren</span>
				<span class='text'>She was told to call her son </span>
				<span class='text'>Hagar then called God who spoke to her  Thou God seest me KJV</span>
				<span class='text'>From that day the well was called Beer lahai roi The well of him that liveth and seeth me</span>
				<span class='text'>KJV margin</span>
				<span class='text'>She then did as she was instructed by returning to her mistress in order to have her child</span>
				<span class='text'>Abraham was eighty six years of age when Ishmael was born</span>
				<span class='text'>Thirteen years later when Abraham was ninety nine years of age God declared Abrahams new name Abrahamampnbsp‚Äì a father of many nations </span>
				<span class='text'>Abraham then received the instructions for the covenant of which  was to be the sign</span>
				<span class='text'>Then God declared Sarais new name  and blessed her and told Abraham I will give thee a son also of her</span>
				<span class='text'> But Abraham laughed and said in his heart Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old and shall Sarah that is ninety years old bear  Immediately after Abrahams encounter with God he had his entire household of men including himself age 99 and Ishmael age 13 circumcised</span>
				<span class='text'>Not long afterward during the heat of the day Abraham had been sitting at the entrance of his tent by the  of </span>
				<span class='text'>He looked up and saw three men in the presence of God</span>
				<span class='text'>Then he ran and  to the ground to welcome them</span>
				<span class='text'>Abraham then offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread of which they assented</span>
				<span class='text'>Abraham rushed to s tent to order cakes made from choice flour then he ordered a servant boy to prepare a choice calf</span>
				<span class='text'>When all was prepared he set curds milk and the calf before them waiting on them under a tree as they ate</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year Sarah would have a son</span>
				<span class='text'>While at the tent entrance Sarah overheard what was said and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages</span>
				<span class='text'>The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at bearing a child at her age as nothing is too hard for God</span>
				<span class='text'>Frightened Sarah denied laughing</span>
				<span class='text'>fter eating Abraham and the three visitors got up</span>
				<span class='text'>They walked over to the peak that overlooked the cities of the plain to discuss the fate of  for their detestable sins that were so great it moved God to action</span>
				<span class='text'>Because Abrahams nephew was living in Sodom God revealed plans to confirm and judge these cities</span>
				<span class='text'>At this point the two other visitors left for Sodom</span>
				<span class='text'>Then Abraham turned to God and pleaded decrementally with Him from fifty persons to less that if there were at least ten righteous men found in the city would not God spare the city For the sake of ten righteous people God declared that he would not destroy the city</span>
				<span class='text'>When the two visitors got to Sodom to conduct their report they planned on staying in the city square</span>
				<span class='text'>However Abrahams nephew Lot met with them and strongly insisted that these two men stay at his house for the night</span>
				<span class='text'>A rally of men stood outside of Lots home and demanded that they bring out his guests so that they may know v</span>
				<span class='text'> them</span>
				<span class='text'>However Lot objected and offered his virgin daughters who had not known v</span>
				<span class='text'> man to the rally of men instead</span>
				<span class='text'>They rejected that notion and sought to break down Lots door to get to his male guests  thus confirming that their cry had waxed great before God and they would be destroyed</span>
				<span class='text'>Early the next morning Abraham went to the place where he stood before God</span>
				<span class='text'>He looked out toward Sodom and Gomorrah and saw what became of the cities of the plain where not even ten righteous v</span>
				<span class='text'>832 had been found as the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace</span>
				<span class='text'>Abraham settled between  and  in the land of the s</span>
				<span class='text'>While he was living in  Abraham openly claimed that Sarah was his sister</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon discovering this news King  had her brought to him</span>
				<span class='text'>God then came to Abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a mans wife</span>
				<span class='text'>Abimelech had not laid hands on her so he inquired if he would also slay a righteous nation especially since Abraham had claimed that he and Sarah were siblings</span>
				<span class='text'>In response God told Abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that is why he continued to exist</span>
				<span class='text'>However should he not return the wife of Abraham back to him God would surely destroy Abimelech and his entire household</span>
				<span class='text'>Abimelech was informed that Abraham was a prophet who would pray for him</span>
				<span class='text'>arly next morning Abimelech informed his servants of his dream and approached Abraham inquiring as to why he had brought such great guilt upon his kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>Abraham stated that he thought there was no fear of God in that place and that they might kill him for his wife</span>
				<span class='text'>Then Abraham defended what he had said as not being a lie at all And yet indeed she is my sister she is the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife</span>
				<span class='text'> Abimelech returned Sarah to Abraham and gave him gifts of sheep oxen and servants and invited him to settle wherever he pleased in Abimelechs lands</span>
				<span class='text'>Further Abimelech gave Abraham a thousand pieces of silver to serve as Sarahs vindication before all</span>
				<span class='text'>Abraham then prayed for Abimelech and his household since God had stricken the women with infertility because of the taking of Sarah</span>
				<span class='text'>After living for some time in the land of the Philistines  and  the chief of his troops approached Abraham because of a dispute that resulted in a violent confrontation at a well</span>
				<span class='text'>Abraham then reproached Abimelech due to his Philistine servants aggressive attacks and the seizing of Abrahams well</span>
				<span class='text'>Abimelech claimed ignorance of the incident</span>
				<span class='text'>Then Abraham offered a pact by providing sheep and oxen to Abimelech</span>
				<span class='text'>Further to attest that Abraham was the one who dug the well he also gave Abimelech seven ewes for proof</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of this sworn oath they called the place of this well </span>
				<span class='text'>After Abimelech and Phicol headed back to  Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba and called upon the name of the  the everlasting God</span>
				<span class='text'>As had been prophesied in Mamre the previous year  Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham on the first anniversary of the covenant of circumcision</span>
				<span class='text'>Abraham was an hundred years old when his son whom he named Isaac was born and he circumcised him when he was eight days old</span>
				<span class='text'> For Sarah the thought of giving birth and nursing a child at such an old age also brought her much laughter as she declared God hath made me to laugh so that all that hear will laugh with me</span>
				<span class='text'> Isaac continued to grow and on the day he was weaned Abraham held a great feast to honor the occasion</span>
				<span class='text'>During the celebration however Sarah found Ishmael mocking an observation that would begin to clarify the birthright of Isaac</span>
				<span class='text'> was fourteen years old when Abrahams son  was born to a different mother Sarah</span>
				<span class='text'>Sarah had finally borne her own child even though she had passed her child bearing period</span>
				<span class='text'>When she found Ishmael teasing Isaac Sarah told Abraham to send both Ishmael and Hagar away</span>
				<span class='text'>She declared that Ishmael would not share in Isaacs inheritance</span>
				<span class='text'>Abraham was greatly distressed by his wifes words and sought the advice of his God</span>
				<span class='text'>God told Abraham not to be distressed but to do as his wife commanded</span>
				<span class='text'>God reassured Abraham that in Isaac shall seed be called to thee</span>
				<span class='text'> He also said that Ishmael would make a nation because he is thy seed</span>
				<span class='text'>Early the next morning Abraham brought Hagar and Ishmael out together</span>
				<span class='text'>He gave her bread and water and sent them away</span>
				<span class='text'>The two wandered in the wilderness of  until her bottle of water was completely consumed</span>
				<span class='text'>In a moment of despair she burst into tears</span>
				<span class='text'>After God heard the boys voice an  of God confirmed to Hagar that he would become a great nation</span>
				<span class='text'>A well of water then appeared so that it saved their lives</span>
				<span class='text'>As the boy grew he became a skilled  living in the wilderness of </span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually his mother found a wife for Ishmael from her home country the land of Egypt</span>
				<span class='text'>At some point in s youth Abraham was commanded by God to offer his son up as a sacrifice in the land of </span>
				<span class='text'>The patriarch traveled three days until he came to the mount that God told him of</span>
				<span class='text'>He commanded the servants to remain while he and Isaac proceeded alone into the mount</span>
				<span class='text'>Isaac carried the wood upon which he would be sacrificed</span>
				<span class='text'>Along the way Isaac asked his father where the animal for the burnt offering was to which Abraham replied God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering</span>
				<span class='text'>Just as Abraham was about to sacrifice his son he was interrupted by the angel of the  and he saw behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns which he sacrificed instead of his son</span>
				<span class='text'>For his obedience he received another promise of numerous descendants and abundant prosperity</span>
				<span class='text'>After this event Abraham went to </span>
				<span class='text'>Sarah died and Abraham buried her in the  the cave of Machpelah near  which he had purchased along with the adjoining field from Ephron the </span>
				<span class='text'> After the death of Sarah Abraham took another wife a  named  by whom he had six sons      and </span>

				<span class='text'> Abraham lived to see his son marry  and possibly to see the birth of his twin grandsons </span>
				<span class='text'>He died at age 175 and was buried in the cave of Machpelah by his sons Isaac and Ishmael</span>
				<span class='text'>  Historicity and origins  has largely dismissed Abrahams purported historicity</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1906  already concluded that Abrahams biography in Genesis should be regarded as legendary</span>
				<span class='text'>Its authors noted that the Elamite invasion of Genesis 14 may be historical and that Abrahams wandering may represent some historical tribal migration but added that by reason of the paucity of information the whole question is obscure</span>
				<span class='text'>n the early and middle 20th century leading archaeologists such as  and biblical scholars such as  believed that the patriarchs and matriarchs were either real individuals or believable composites of people who lived in the  the 2nd millennium BCE</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1970s new arguments concerning Israels past and the biblical texts challenged these views these arguments can be found in  s  1974 and   1975</span>
				<span class='text'>Thompson a literary scholar based his argument on archaeology and ancient texts</span>
				<span class='text'>His thesis centered on the lack of compelling evidence that the patriarchs lived in the 2nd millennium and noted how certain biblical texts lected first millennium conditions and concerns</span>
				<span class='text'>Van Seters examined the patriarchal stories and argued that their names social milieu and messages strongly suggested that they were  creations</span>
				<span class='text'>By the beginning of the 21st century archaeologists had given up hope of recovering any context that would make Abraham Isaac or Jacob credible historical figures</span>
				<span class='text'>brahams name is apparently very ancient as the tradition found in Genesis no longer understands its original meaning probably Father is exalted ‚Äì the meaning offered in Genesis 175 Father of a multitude is a popular etymology</span>
				<span class='text'>The name is a variant of  and is known to have been a Babylonian personal name in the 24th century BCE the renaming to Abraham in Genesis 17 which yields no sense in Hebrew may lect simply a spelling variation where the h </span>
				<span class='text'>brahams story like those of the other patriarchs most likely had a substantial oral prehistory</span>
				<span class='text'>At some stage the oral traditions became part of the written tradition of the  a majority of scholars believes this stage belongs to the Persian period roughly 520‚Äì320 BCE</span>
				<span class='text'>The mechanisms by which this came about remain unknown but there are currently two important hypotheses</span>
				<span class='text'>The first called Persian Imperial authorisation is that the post Exilic community devised the Torah as a legal basis on which to function within the Persian Imperial system the second is that Pentateuch was written to provide the criteria for who would belong to the post Exilic Jewish community and to establish the power structures and relative positions of its various groups notably the priesthood and the lay elders</span>
				<span class='text'>evertheless the completion of the Torah and its elevation to the centre of post Exilic Judaism was as much or more about combining older texts as writing new ones ‚Äì the final Pentateuch was based on existing traditions</span>
				<span class='text'>In   written during the Exile i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>in the first half of the 6th century BCE Ezekiel an exile in Babylon tells how those who remained in Judah are claiming ownership of the land based on inheritance from Abraham but the prophet tells them they have no claim because they dont observe Torah</span>
				<span class='text'>  similarly testifies of tension between the people of Judah and the returning post Exilic Jews the  stating that God is the father of Israel and that Israels history begins with the Exodus and not with Abraham</span>
				<span class='text'>The conclusion to be inferred from this and similar evidence e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> is that the figure of Abraham must have been preeminent among the great landowners of Judah at the time of the Exile and after serving to support their claims to the land in opposition to those of the returning exiles</span>
				<span class='text'>Abraham in religious traditions Abraham is given a high position of respect in three major world faiths   and </span>
				<span class='text'>In Judaism he is the founding father of the Covenant the special relationship between the Jewish people and Godampnbsp‚Äì a belief which gives the Jews a unique position as the </span>
				<span class='text'>In Christianity the Apostle  taught that Abrahams faith in God ‚Äì preceding the  ‚Äì made him the prototype of all believers  and uncircumcised</span>
				<span class='text'>The Islamic prophet  claimed Abraham whose submission to God constituted islam as a believer before the fact and undercut Jewish claims to an exclusive relationship with God and the Covenant</span>
				<span class='text'>n Jewish tradition Abraham is called Avraham Avinu ◊ê◊ë◊®◊î◊ù ◊ê◊ë◊ô◊†◊ï our father Abraham signifying that he is both the biological progenitor of the Jews including converts according to Jewish tradition and the father of Judaism the first Jew</span>
				<span class='text'>His story is read in the weekly  reading portions predominantly in the   ◊ú÷∂◊ö÷∞ ◊ú÷∞◊ö÷∏  ◊ï÷∑◊ô÷µ÷º◊®÷∏◊ê  ◊ó÷∑◊ô÷µ÷º◊ô ◊©÷∏◊Ç◊®÷∏◊î and  ◊™÷º◊ï÷π◊ú÷∞◊ì÷π◊™</span>
				<span class='text'>braham does not loom so large in Christianity as he does in Judaism and Islam</span>
				<span class='text'>It is  as the  who is central to Christianity and the idea of a divine  is what separates Christianity from the other two religions</span>
				<span class='text'>In  4 Abrahams merit is less his obedience to the divine will than his faith in Gods ultimate grace this faith provides him the merit for Gods having chosen him for the covenant and the covenant becomes one of faith not obedience</span>
