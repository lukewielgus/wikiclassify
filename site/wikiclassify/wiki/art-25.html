				<span class='text'>In the 1970s, new arguments concerning Israel's past and the biblical texts challenged these views; these arguments can be found in  [[Thomas L</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Thompson|2002|p=23-24}} The name is a variant of [[Abiram]] and is known to have been a Babylonian personal name in the 24th century BCE; the renaming to Abraham in Genesis 17, which &quot;yields no sense in Hebrew&quot;, may reflect simply a spelling variation where the ''h'' [[Mater lectionis|denotes a vowel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|''JE''|1925}}Abraham's story, like those of the other patriarchs, most likely had a substantial oral prehistory</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Pitard|2001|p=27}} At some stage the oral traditions became part of the written tradition of the [[Pentateuch]]; a majority of scholars believes this stage belongs to the Persian period, roughly 520‚Äì320 BCE</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ska|2009|p=260}} The mechanisms by which this came about remain unknown,{{sfn|Enns|2012|p=26}} but there are currently two important hypotheses</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ska|2006|p=217,227‚Äì228}} The first, called Persian Imperial authorisation, is that the post-Exilic community devised the Torah as a legal basis on which to function within the Persian Imperial system; the second is that Pentateuch was written to provide the criteria for who would belong to the post Exilic Jewish community and to establish the power structures and relative positions of its various groups, notably the priesthood and the lay &quot;elders&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ska|2006|p=217,227‚Äì228}}Nevertheless, the completion of the Torah and its elevation to the centre of post-Exilic Judaism was as much or more about combining older texts as writing new ones ‚Äì the final Pentateuch was based on existing traditions</span>

				<span class='text'> in the first half of the 6th century BCE), Ezekiel, an exile in Babylon, tells how those who remained in Judah are claiming ownership of the land based on inheritance from Abraham; but the prophet tells them they have no claim because they don't observe Torah</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Ska|2009|p=43}} [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] {{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|63:16|HE}} similarly testifies of tension between the people of Judah and the returning post-Exilic Jews (the &quot;[[Golah|g√¥l√¢]]&quot;), stating that God is the father of Israel and that Israel's history begins with the Exodus and not with Abraham</span>
