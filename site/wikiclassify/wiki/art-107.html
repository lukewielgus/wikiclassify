				<span class='text'>vg}}'''Carl Edward Sagan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|ɡ|ə|n}}; November 9, 1934 – December 20, 1996) was an American [[astronomer]], [[physical cosmology|cosmologist]], [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]], [[Astrobiology|astrobiologist]], author, science popularizer, and [[science communicator]] in astronomy and other natural sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>His contributions were central to the discovery of the high surface temperatures of [[Venus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he is best known for his contributions to the scientific research of [[extraterrestrial life]], including experimental demonstration of the production of [[amino acids]] from basic chemicals by [[radiation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Sagan assembled the first physical messages that were sent into space: the [[Pioneer plaque]] and the [[Voyager Golden Record]], universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them</span>
				<span class='text'>e published more than 600 scientific papers and articles and was author, co-author or editor of more than 20 books</span>
				<span class='text'>Sagan wrote many [[popular science]] books, such as ''[[The Dragons of Eden]]'', ''[[Broca's Brain]]'' and ''[[Pale Blue Dot (book)|Pale Blue Dot]]'', and narrated and co-wrote the award-winning 1980 television series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]''</span>
				<span class='text'> The most widely watched series in the history of American [[public television]], ''Cosmos'' has been seen by at least 500 million people across 60 different countries</span>

				<span class='text'>He also wrote the science fiction novel ''[[Contact (novel)|Contact]]'', the basis for a 1997 [[Contact (1997 American film)|film of the same name]]</span>
				<span class='text'>agan always advocated [[Scientific skepticism|scientific skeptical inquiry]] and the [[scientific method]], pioneered [[exobiology]] and promoted the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence ([[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]])</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent most of his career as a professor of astronomy at [[Cornell University]], where he directed the Laboratory for [[Planetary science|Planetary Studies]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Sagan and his works received numerous awards and honors, including the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]], the [[National Academy of Sciences]] [[Public Welfare Medal]], the [[Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction]] for his book ''The Dragons of Eden'', and, regarding ''Cosmos: A Personal Voyage'', two [[Emmy Award]]s, the [[Peabody Award]] and the [[Hugo Award]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He married three times and had five children</span>
				<span class='text'>After suffering from [[myelodysplasia]], Sagan died of [[pneumonia]] at the age of 62 on December 20, 1996</span>

				<span class='text'>His mother, Rachel Molly Gruber, was a housewife from New York</span>
				<span class='text'>Carl was named in honor of Rachel's [[biological mother]], Chaiya Clara, in Sagan's words, &quot;the mother she never knew</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot;&gt;[[#Davidson|Davidson 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt;He had a sister, Carol, and the family lived in a modest apartment near the Atlantic Ocean, in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]], a Brooklyn neighborhood</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Sagan, they were [[Reform Judaism|Reform Jews]], the most liberal of North American Judaism's four main groups</span>
				<span class='text'>Both Sagan and his sister agreed that their father was not especially religious, but that their mother &quot;definitely believed in God, and was active in the temple&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and served only [[Kosher foods|kosher]] meat</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|12}} During the depths of the [[Great Depression|Depression]], his father worked as a theater usher</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to biographer Keay Davidson, Sagan's &quot;inner war&quot; was a result of his close relationship with both of his parents, who were in many ways &quot;opposites</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Sagan traced his later analytical urges to his mother, a woman who had been extremely poor as a child in New York City during [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] and the 1920s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|2}} As a young woman she had held her own intellectual ambitions, but they were frustrated by social restrictions: her poverty, her status as a woman and a wife, and her Jewish ethnicity</span>
				<span class='text'>Davidson notes that she therefore &quot;worshipped her only son, Carl</span>
				<span class='text'>He would fulfill her unfulfilled dreams</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|2}}However, he claimed that his sense of wonder came from his father</span>
				<span class='text'>In his free time he gave apples to the poor or helped soothe labor-management tensions within New York's garment industry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|2}} Although he was awed by Carl's intellectual abilities, he took his son's inquisitiveness in stride and saw it as part of his growing up</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|2}} In his later years as a writer and scientist, Sagan would often draw on his childhood memories to illustrate scientific points, as he did in his book, ''[[Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (book)|Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|9}} Sagan describes his parents' influence on his later thinking:: My parents were not scientists</span>
				<span class='text'>They knew almost nothing about science</span>
				<span class='text'>But in introducing me simultaneously to skepticism and to wonder, they taught me the two uneasily cohabiting modes of thought that are central to the scientific method</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Spangenburg&quot;&gt;[[#Spangenburg &amp; Moser|Spangenburg &amp; Moser 2004]], pp</span>
				<span class='text'>2–5&lt;/ref&gt;=== 1939 World's Fair ===Sagan recalls that one of his most defining moments was when his parents took him to the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] when he was four years old</span>
				<span class='text'>The exhibits became a turning point in his life</span>
				<span class='text'>He later recalled the moving map of the ''[[Futurama (New York World's Fair)|America of Tomorrow]]'' exhibit: &quot;It showed beautiful highways and cloverleaves and little General Motors cars all carrying people to skyscrapers, buildings with lovely spires, flying buttresses—and it looked great!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|14}} At other exhibits, he remembered how a flashlight that shone on a [[Solar cell|photoelectric cell]] created a crackling sound, and how the sound from a [[tuning fork]] became a wave on an [[oscilloscope]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also witnessed the future media technology that would replace radio: television</span>
				<span class='text'>Sagan wrote:: Plainly, the world held wonders of a kind I had never guessed</span>
				<span class='text'>How could a tone become a picture and light become a noise?&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|14}}He also saw one of the Fair's most publicized events, the burial of a [[time capsule]] at [[Flushing Meadows–Corona Park|Flushing Meadows]], which contained mementos of the 1930s to be recovered by Earth's descendants in a future millennium</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The time capsule thrilled Carl,&quot; writes Davidson</span>
				<span class='text'>As an adult, Sagan and his colleagues would create similar time capsules—ones that would be sent out into the galaxy; these were the [[Pioneer plaque]] and the ''[[Voyager Golden Record]]'' records, all of which were spinoffs of Sagan's memories of the World's Fair</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|15}}=== World War II ===During [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] Sagan's family worried about the fate of their European relatives</span>
				<span class='text'>Sagan, however, was generally unaware of the details of the ongoing war</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote, &quot;Sure, we had relatives who were caught up in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] was not a popular fellow in our household</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;But on the other hand, I was fairly insulated from the horrors of the war</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; His sister, Carol, said that their mother &quot;above all wanted to protect Carl</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;She had an extraordinarily difficult time dealing with World War&amp;nbsp;II and the Holocaust</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|15}} Sagan's book, ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' (1996), included his memories of this conflicted period, when his family dealt with the realities of the war in Europe but tried to prevent it from undermining his optimistic spirit</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Spangenburg&quot; /&gt;=== Inquisitiveness about nature ===Soon after entering elementary school he began to express a strong inquisitiveness about nature</span>
				<span class='text'>Sagan recalled taking his first trips to the [[public library]] alone, at the age of five, when his mother got him a library card</span>
				<span class='text'>He wanted to learn what stars were, since none of his friends or their parents could give him a clear answer:: I went to the librarian and asked for a book about stars&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>And the answer was stunning</span>
				<span class='text'>It was that the Sun was a star but really close</span>
				<span class='text'>The stars were suns, but so far away they were just little points of light&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The scale of the universe suddenly opened up to me</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a kind of religious experience</span>
				<span class='text'>There was a magnificence to it, a grandeur, a scale which has never left me</span>
				<span class='text'>Never ever left me</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|18}}At about age six or seven, he and a close friend took trips to the [[American Museum of Natural History]] across the East River in [[Manhattan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While there, they went to the [[Hayden Planetarium]] and walked around the museum's exhibits of [[outer space|space]] objects, such as [[meteorite]]s, and displays of dinosaurs and animals in natural settings</span>
				<span class='text'>Sagan writes about those visits:: I was transfixed by the dioramas—lifelike representations of animals and their habitats all over the world</span>
				<span class='text'>Penguins on the dimly lit Antarctic ice;&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> family of [[gorilla]]s, the male beating his chest,&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>n American [[grizzly bear]] standing on his hind legs, ten or twelve feet tall, and staring me right in the eye</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|18}}His parents helped nurture his growing interest in science by buying him chemistry sets and reading materials</span>
				<span class='text'>His interest in space, however, was his primary focus, especially after reading science fiction stories by writers such as [[H</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>Wells]] and [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], which stirred his imagination about life on other planets such as [[Mars]]</span>
				<span class='text'>According to biographer Ray Spangenburg, these early years as Sagan tried to understand the mysteries of the planets became a &quot;driving force in his life, a continual spark to his intellect, and a quest that would never be forgotten</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spangenburg&quot; /&gt;In 1947 he discovered ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' magazine, which introduced him to more [[hard science fiction]] speculations than those in Burroughs's novels</span>
				<span class='text'>That same year inaugurated the &quot;[[flying saucer]]&quot; [[mass hysteria]] with the young Carl suspecting the &quot;discs&quot; might be alien spaceships</span>

				<span class='text'>Boody Junior High School</span>
				<span class='text'>He had his [[bar mitzvah]] in Bensonhurst when he turned 13</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|23}} The following year, 1948, his family moved to the nearby town of [[Rahway, New Jersey]] for his father's work, where Sagan then entered [[Rahway High School]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He graduated in 1951</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|23}} Rahway was an older industrial town, and the Sagans were among its few Jewish families</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|23}}Sagan was a straight-A student but was bored due to unchallenging classes and uninspiring teachers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|23}} His teachers realized this and tried to convince his parents to send him to a private school, the administrator telling them, &quot;This kid ought to go to a school for gifted children, he has something really remarkable</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|24}} This they couldn't do, partly because of the cost</span>
				<span class='text'>agan was made president of the school's chemistry club, and at home he set up his own laboratory</span>
				<span class='text'>He taught himself about molecules by making cardboard cutouts to help him visualize how [[molecules]] were formed: &quot;I found that about as interesting as doing [chemical] experiments,&quot; he said</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Davidson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|24}} Sagan remained mostly interested in astronomy as a hobby, and in his junior year made it a career goal after he learned that astronomers were paid for doing what he always enjoyed: &quot;That was a splendid day&amp;shy;&amp;shy;&amp;shy;&amp;shy;—when I began to suspect that if I tried hard I could do astronomy full-time, not just part-time</span>

				<span class='text'>In one of his last written works, Sagan argued that the chances of extraterrestrial spacecraft visiting Earth are vanishingly small</span>
