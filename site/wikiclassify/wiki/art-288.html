				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Rousseau's autobiographical writings — his ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'', which initiated the modern autobiography, and his ''[[Reveries of a Solitary Walker]]'' — exemplified the late 18th-century movement known as the ''Age of Sensibility'', and featured an increased focus on subjectivity and introspection that later characterized modern writing</span>
				<span class='text'>His ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'' and ''[[The Social Contract]]'' are cornerstones in modern political and social thought</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the period of the [[French Revolution]], Rousseau was the most popular of the [[philosophes]] among members of the [[Jacobin Club]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Rousseau was interred as a national hero in the [[Panthéon (Paris)|Panthéon]] in Paris, in 1794, 16 years after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>=Biography=====Youth===Rousseau was born in [[Geneva]], which was at the time a [[History of Geneva#Reformation|city-state]] and a Protestant associate of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Since 1536, Geneva had been a [[Huguenot]] republic and the seat of [[Calvinism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Five generations before Rousseau, his ancestor Didier, a bookseller who may have published Protestant tracts, had escaped persecution from French Catholics by fleeing to Geneva in 1549, where he became a wine merchant</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}Rousseau was proud that his family, of the ''moyen'' order (or middle-class), had voting rights in the city</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout his life, he generally signed his books &quot;Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Citizen of Geneva&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005 | p = 31}}Geneva, in theory, was governed democratically by its male voting &quot;citizens&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The citizens were a minority of the population when compared to the immigrants, referred to as &quot;inhabitants&quot;, whose descendants were called &quot;natives&quot; and continued to lack suffrage</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, rather than being run by vote of the &quot;citizens&quot;, the city was ruled by a small number of wealthy families that made up the &quot;Council of Two Hundred&quot;; these delegated their power to a twenty-five member executive group from among them called the &quot;Little Council&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>here was much political debate within Geneva, extending down to the tradespeople</span>
				<span class='text'>Much discussion was over the idea of the sovereignty of the people, of which the ruling class oligarchy was making a mockery</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1707, a democratic reformer named [[Pierre Fatio]] protested this situation, saying &quot;a sovereign that never performs an act of sovereignty is an imaginary being&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Damrosch|2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}} He was shot by order of the Little Council</span>
				<span class='text'>Jean-Jacques Rousseau's father, Isaac, was not in the city at this time, but Jean-Jacques’s grandfather supported Fatio and was penalized for it</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005 | p = 31}}[[File:Rousseau Geneve House</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|upright|The house where Rousseau was born at number 40, Grand-Rue</span>
				<span class='text'>]The trade of watchmaking had become a family tradition by the time of Rousseau’s father, Isaac Rousseau</span>
				<span class='text'>Isaac followed his grandfather, father and brothers into the business, except for a short stint teaching dance as a dance master</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Damrosch|2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}  Isaac, notwithstanding his artisan status, was well educated and a lover of music</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;A Genevan watchmaker&quot;, Rousseau wrote, &quot;is a man who can be introduced anywhere; a Parisian watchmaker is only fit to talk about watches&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Damrosch|2005| p = 31 | ps =: &quot;And indeed, a British visitor commented, 'Even the lower class of people [of Geneva] are exceedingly well informed, and there is perhaps no city in Europe where learning is more universally diffused'; another at mid-century noticed that Genevan workmen were fond of reading the works of Locke and Montesquieu</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;}} In 1699, Isaac ran into political difficulty by entering a quarrel with visiting English officers, who in response drew their swords and threatened him</span>
				<span class='text'>After local officials stepped in, it was Isaac who was punished, as Geneva was concerned with maintaining its ties to foreign powers</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}Rousseau's mother, Suzanne Bernard Rousseau, was from an upper-class family</span>
				<span class='text'>She was raised by her uncle Samuel Bernard, a Calvinist preacher</span>
				<span class='text'>He cared for Suzanne after her father Jacques (who had run into trouble with the legal and religious authorities for fornication and having a mistress) died in his early thirties</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}  In 1695, Suzanne had to answer charges that she had attended a street theater disguised as a peasant woman so she could gaze upon M</span>
				<span class='text'>Vincent Sarrasin, whom she fancied despite his continuing marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>After a hearing, she was ordered by the [[Genevan Consistory]] to never interact with him again</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}} She married Rousseau's father at the age of 31</span>
				<span class='text'>Isaac's sister had married Suzanne's brother eight years earlier, after she had become pregnant and they had been chastised by the Consistory</span>
				<span class='text'>The child died at birth</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, the young Rousseau was told a romantic fairy-tale about the situation by the adults in his family — a tale where young love was denied by a disapproving patriarch but that prevailed by sibling loyalty that, in the story, resulted in love conquering all and two marriages uniting the families on the same day</span>
				<span class='text'>Rousseau never learnt the truth</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}Rousseau was born on 28 June 1712, and he would later relate: &quot;I was born almost dying, they had little hope of saving me&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}} He was baptized on 4 July 1712, in the great cathedral</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}} His mother died of [[puerperal fever]] nine days after his birth, which he later described as &quot;the first of my misfortunes&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}He and his older brother François were brought up by their father and a paternal aunt, also named Suzanne</span>
				<span class='text'>When Rousseau was five, his father sold the house that the family had received from his mother's relatives</span>
				<span class='text'>While the idea was that his sons would inherit the principal when grown up and he would live off the interest in the meantime, in the end the father took most of the substantial proceeds</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}} With the selling of the house, the Rousseau family moved out of the upper-class neighborhood and moved into an apartment house in a neighborhood of craftsmen—silversmiths, engravers, and other watchmakers</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}} Growing up around craftsmen, Rousseau would later contrast them favorably to those who produced more aesthetic works, writing &quot;those important persons who are called artists rather than artisans, work solely for the idle and rich, and put an arbitrary price on their baubles&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Damrosch|2005}}{{Page needed|date=June 2015}} Rousseau was also exposed to class politics in this environment, as the artisans often agitated in a campaign of resistance against the privileged class running Geneva</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}Rousseau had no recollection of learning to read, but he remembered how when he was 5 or 6 his father encouraged his love of reading:{{quote |text=Every night, after supper, we read some part of a small collection of romances [i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> adventure stories], which had been my mother's</span>
				<span class='text'>My father's design was only to improve me in reading, and he thought these entertaining works were calculated to give me a fondness for it; but we soon found ourselves so interested in the adventures they contained, that we alternately read whole nights together and could not bear to give over until at the conclusion of a volume</span>
				<span class='text'>Sometimes, in the morning, on hearing the swallows at our window, my father, quite ashamed of this weakness, would cry, &quot;Come, come, let us go to bed; I am more a child than thou art</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (Confessions, Book 1)}} Rousseau's reading of escapist stories (such as ''[[L'Astrée]]'' by [[Honoré d'Urfé]]) had an effect on him; he later wrote that they &quot;gave me bizarre and romantic notions of human life, which experience and reflection have never been able to cure me of&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Damrosch|2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}} After they had finished reading the novels, they began to read a collection of ancient and modern classics left by his mother's uncle</span>
				<span class='text'>Of these, his favorite was [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans]]'', which he would read to his father while he made watches</span>
				<span class='text'>Rousseau saw Plutarch's work as another kind of novel—the noble actions of heroes—and he would act out the deeds of the characters he was reading about</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}Witnessing the local townsfolk participate in [[militia]]s made a big impression on Rousseau</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout his life, he would recall one scene where, after the volunteer militia had finished its manoeuvres, they began to dance around a fountain and most of the people from neighboring buildings came out to join them, including him and his father</span>
				<span class='text'>Rousseau would always see militias as the embodiment of popular spirit in opposition to the armies of the rulers, whom he saw as disgraceful mercenaries</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Damrosch|2005}}{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}When Rousseau was 10, his father, an avid hunter, got into a legal quarrel with a wealthy landowner on whose lands he had been caught trespassing</span>
				<span class='text'>To avoid certain defeat in the courts, he moved away to Nyon in the territory of Bern, taking Rousseau's aunt Suzanne with him</span>
				<span class='text'>He remarried, and from that point Jean-Jacques saw little of him</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005 | p = 24}} Jean-Jacques was left with his maternal uncle, who packed him, along with his own son, Abraham Bernard, away to board for two years with a Calvinist minister in a hamlet outside Geneva</span>
				<span class='text'>Here, the boys picked up the elements of mathematics and drawing</span>
				<span class='text'>Rousseau, who was always deeply moved by religious services, for a time even dreamed of becoming a Protestant minister</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:LesCharmettes</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Les Charmettes, where Rousseau lived with [[Françoise-Louise de Warens|Mme</span>
				<span class='text'>de Warens]] in 1735–6, now a museum dedicated to Rousseau</span>
				<span class='text'>]Virtually all our information about Rousseau's youth has come from his posthumously published ''Confessions'', in which the chronology is somewhat confused, though recent scholars have combed the archives for confirming evidence to fill in the blanks</span>
				<span class='text'>At age 13, Rousseau was apprenticed first to a [[civil law notary|notary]] and then to an engraver who beat him</span>
				<span class='text'>At 15, he ran away from Geneva (on 14 March 1728) after returning to the city and finding the city gates locked due to the curfew</span>
				<span class='text'>n adjoining [[Savoy]] he took shelter with a Roman Catholic priest, who introduced him to [[Françoise-Louise de Warens]], age 29</span>
				<span class='text'>She was a noblewoman of Protestant background who was separated from her husband</span>
				<span class='text'>As professional lay proselytizer, she was paid by the King of [[Piedmont]] to help bring Protestants to Catholicism</span>
				<span class='text'>They sent the boy to [[Turin]], the capital of Savoy (which included Piedmont, in what is now Italy), to complete his conversion</span>
				<span class='text'>This resulted in his having to give up his Genevan citizenship, although he would later revert to Calvinism in order to regain it</span>
				<span class='text'>n converting to Catholicism, both De Warens and Rousseau were likely reacting to Calvinism's insistence on the [[total depravity]] of man</span>
				<span class='text'>Leo Damrosch writes: &quot;An eighteenth-century Genevan liturgy still required believers to declare 'that we are miserable sinners, born in corruption, inclined to evil, incapable by ourselves of doing good'&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Damrosch|2005|p = 121}} De Warens, a [[deist]] by inclination, was attracted to Catholicism's doctrine of forgiveness of sins</span>
				<span class='text'>==Adulthood===Finding himself on his own, since his father and uncle had more or less disowned him, the teenage Rousseau supported himself for a time as a servant, secretary, and tutor, wandering in Italy (Piedmont and Savoy) and France</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time, he lived on and off with De Warens, whom he idolized and called his &quot;''maman''&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Flattered by his devotion, De Warens tried to get him started in a profession, and arranged formal music lessons for him</span>
				<span class='text'>At one point, he briefly attended a seminary with the idea of becoming a priest</span>
				<span class='text'>hen Rousseau reached 20, De Warens took him as her lover, while intimate also with the steward of her house</span>
				<span class='text'>The sexual aspect of their relationship (in fact a ''[[ménage à trois]]'') confused Rousseau and made him uncomfortable, but he always considered De Warens the greatest love of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>A rather profligate spender, she had a large library and loved to entertain and listen to music</span>
				<span class='text'>She and her circle, comprising educated members of the Catholic clergy, introduced Rousseau to the world of letters and ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>ousseau had been an indifferent student, but during his 20s, which were marked by long bouts of [[hypochondria]], he applied himself in earnest to the study of philosophy, mathematics, and music</span>
				<span class='text'> At 25, he came into a small inheritance from his mother and used a portion of it to repay De Warens for her financial support of him</span>
				<span class='text'>At 27, he took a job as a tutor in [[Lyon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1742, Rousseau moved to Paris in order to present the [[Académie des Sciences]] with a new system of [[numbered musical notation]] he believed would make his fortune</span>
				<span class='text'>His system, intended to be compatible with [[typography]], is based on a single line, displaying numbers representing [[interval (music)|intervals]] between notes and dots and commas indicating rhythmic values</span>
				<span class='text'>Believing the system was impractical, the Academy rejected it, though they praised his mastery of the subject, and urged him to try again</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Palazzo Surian Bellotto (Venice)</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|Palazzo belonging to Tommaso Querini at 968 Cannaregio [[Venice]] that served as the French Embassy during Rousseau's period as Secretary to the Ambassador]]From 1743 to 1744, Rousseau had an honorable but ill-paying post as a secretary to the Comte de Montaigue, the French ambassador to [[Venice]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This awoke in him a lifelong love for Italian music, particularly opera:{{Quote | I had brought with me from Paris the prejudice of that city against Italian music; but I had also received from nature a sensibility and niceness of distinction which prejudice cannot withstand</span>
				<span class='text'>I soon contracted that passion for Italian music with which it inspires all those who are capable of feeling its excellence</span>

				<span class='text'>| Confessions{{Page needed |date=June 2015}}}}Rousseau’s employer routinely received his stipend as much as a year late and paid his staff irregularly</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005 | p = 168 | ps =: the count was &quot;a virtual parody of a parasitic aristocrat, incredibly stupid, irascible, and swollen with self importance</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  He spoke no Italian, a language in which Rousseau was fluent</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Rousseau did most of the work of the embassy, he was treated like a valet</span>
				<span class='text'>}  After 11 months, Rousseau quit, taking from the experience a profound distrust of government bureaucracy</span>
				<span class='text'>===Return to Paris====Returning to Paris, the penniless Rousseau befriended and became the lover of [[Thérèse Levasseur]], a seamstress who was the sole support of her mother and numerous ne'er-do-well siblings</span>
				<span class='text'>At first, they did not live together, though later Rousseau took Thérèse and her mother in to live with him as his servants, and himself assumed the burden of supporting her large family</span>
				<span class='text'>According to his ''Confessions'', before she moved in with him, Thérèse bore him a son and as many as four other children (there is no independent verification for this number&lt;ref&gt;Some of Rousseau's contemporaries believed the babies were not his</span>
				<span class='text'>George Sand has written an essai, &quot;Les Charmettes&quot; (1865</span>
				<span class='text'>Printed in the same volume as &quot;Laura&quot; from the same year) in which she explains why Rousseau may have accused himself falsely</span>
				<span class='text'>She quotes her grandmother, in whose family Rousseau had been a tutor, and who stated that Rousseau could not get children</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;)</span>
				<span class='text'>ousseau wrote that he persuaded Thérèse to give each of the newborns up to a foundling hospital, for the sake of her &quot;honor&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Her mother, who feared the inconvenience of a brat, came to my aid, and she [Thérèse] allowed herself to be overcome&quot; (''Confessions'')</span>
				<span class='text'>In his letter to Madame de Francueil in 1751, he first pretended that he wasn't rich enough to raise his children, but in Book IX of the ''Confessions'' he gave the true reasons of his choice: &quot;I trembled at the thought of intrusting them to a family ill brought up, to be still worse educated</span>
				<span class='text'>The risk of the education of the [[foundling hospital]] was much less&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>en years later, Rousseau made inquiries about the fate of his son, but no record could be found</span>
				<span class='text'>When Rousseau subsequently became celebrated as a theorist of education and child-rearing, his abandonment of his children was used by his critics, including [[Voltaire]] and [[Edmund Burke]], as the basis for ''ad hominem'' attacks</span>
				<span class='text'>hile in Paris, Rousseau became a close friend of French philosopher [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and, beginning with some articles on music in 1749,&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau in his musical articles in the ''Encyclopédie'' engaged in lively controversy with other musicians, e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>ousseau's ideas were the result of an almost obsessive dialogue with writers of the past, filtered in many cases through conversations with Diderot</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1749, Rousseau was paying daily visits to Diderot, who had been thrown into the fortress of [[Vincennes]] under a ''[[lettre de cachet]]'' for opinions in his &quot;''[[Lettre sur les aveugles à l'usage de ceux qui voient|Lettre sur les aveugles]]''&quot;, that hinted at [[materialism]], a belief in [[atoms]], and [[natural selection]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to science historian [[Conway Zirkle]], Rousseau saw the concept of natural selection &quot;as an agent for improving the human species</span>

				<span class='text'>307/984852}}&lt;/ref&gt;Rousseau had read about an essay competition sponsored by the [[Académie de Dijon]] to be published in the ''Mercure de France'' on the theme of whether the development of the arts and sciences had been morally beneficial</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote that while walking to Vincennes (about three miles from Paris), he had a revelation that the arts and sciences were responsible for the moral degeneration of mankind, who were basically good by nature</span>
				<span class='text'>Rousseau's 1750 ''[[Discourse on the Arts and Sciences]]'' was awarded the first prize and gained him significant fame</span>
				<span class='text'>ousseau continued his interest in music</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote both the words and music of his opera ''[[Le devin du village]]'' (''The Village Soothsayer''), which was performed for [[Louis XV of France|King Louis XV]] in 1752</span>
				<span class='text'>The king was so pleased by the work that he offered Rousseau a lifelong pension</span>
				<span class='text'>To the exasperation of his friends, Rousseau turned down the great honor, bringing him notoriety as &quot;the man who had refused a king's pension&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He also turned down several other advantageous offers, sometimes with a brusqueness bordering on truculence that gave offense and caused him problems</span>
				<span class='text'>The same year, the visit of a troupe of Italian musicians to Paris, and their performance of [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]]'s ''[[La serva padrona]]'', prompted the [[Querelle des Bouffons]], which pitted protagonists of French music against supporters of the Italian style</span>
				<span class='text'>Rousseau as noted above, was an enthusiastic supporter of the Italians against [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] and others, making an important contribution with his ''Letter on French Music''</span>
				<span class='text'>===Return to Geneva (1754)====On returning to Geneva in 1754, Rousseau reconverted to [[Calvinism]] and regained his official Genevan citizenship</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1755, Rousseau completed his second major work, the ''Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men'' (the ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]''), which elaborated on the arguments of the ''Discourse on the Arts and Sciences''</span>
				<span class='text'>e also pursued an unconsummated romantic attachment with the 25-year-old [[Sophie d'Houdetot]], which partly inspired his [[epistolary novel]], ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise|Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse]]'' (also based on memories of his idyllic youthful relationship with Mme de Warens)</span>
				<span class='text'>Sophie was the cousin and houseguest of Rousseau's patroness and landlady [[Louise d'Épinay|Madame d'Épinay]], whom he treated rather highhandedly</span>
				<span class='text'>He resented being at Mme</span>
				<span class='text'>d'Épinay's beck and call and detested the insincere conversation and shallow atheism of the ''Encyclopedistes'' whom he met at her table</span>
				<span class='text'>Wounded feelings gave rise to a bitter three-way quarrel between Rousseau and Madame d'Épinay; her lover, the journalist [[Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm|Grimm]]; and their mutual friend, Diderot, who took their side against Rousseau</span>
				<span class='text'>Diderot later described Rousseau as being &quot;false, vain as Satan, ungrateful, cruel, hypocritical, and wicked</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>He sucked ideas from me, used them himself, and then affected to despise me&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>His mansion was [[Le Palais du Peyrou]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]Rousseau's break with the ''Encyclopedistes'' coincided with the composition of his three major works, in all of which he emphasized his fervent belief in a spiritual origin of man's soul and the universe, in contradistinction to the [[materialism]] of Diderot, [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie|La Mettrie]] and [[Baron d'Holbach|D'Holbach]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period, Rousseau enjoyed the support and patronage of [[Duc de Piney|Charles François Frédéric de Montmorency-Luxembourg]] and the [[Louis François I de Bourbon, prince de Conti|Prince de Conti]], two of the richest and most powerful nobles in France</span>
				<span class='text'>These men truly liked Rousseau and enjoyed his ability to converse on any subject, but they also used him as a way of getting back at [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and the political faction surrounding his mistress, [[Madame de Pompadour]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Even with them, however, Rousseau went too far, courting rejection when he criticized the practice of [[tax farming]], in which some of them engaged</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Damrosch | 2005 | p = 357}}Rousseau's 800-page novel of [[Sentimentality|sentiment]], ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise|Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse]]'', was published in 1761 to immense success</span>
				<span class='text'>The book's rhapsodic descriptions of the natural beauty of the Swiss countryside struck a chord in the public and may have helped spark the subsequent nineteenth-century craze for Alpine scenery</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1762, Rousseau published ''Du Contrat Social, Principes du droit politique'' (in English, literally ''[[The Social Contract|Of the Social Contract, Principles of Political Right]]'') in April</span>
				<span class='text'>Even his friend [[Antoine-Jacques Roustan]] felt impelled to write a polite rebuttal of the chapter on Civil Religion in the ''Social Contract'', which implied that the concept of a [[Christian republic]] was paradoxical since Christianity taught submission rather than participation in public affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>Rousseau helped Roustan find a publisher for the rebuttal</span>

				<span class='text'>A famous section of ''Emile'', &quot;The Profession of Faith of a Savoyard Vicar&quot;, was intended to be a defense of religious belief</span>
				<span class='text'>Rousseau's choice of a Catholic vicar of humble peasant background (plausibly based on a kindly prelate he had met as a teenager) as a spokesman for the defense of religion was in itself a daring innovation for the time</span>
				<span class='text'> The vicar's creed was that of [[Socinianism]] (or [[Unitarianism]] as it is called today)</span>
				<span class='text'>Because it rejected original sin and [[Revelation|divine revelation]], both Protestant and Catholic authorities took offense</span>

				<span class='text'>Subsequently, Rousseau accepted an invitation to reside in [[Môtiers]], fifteen miles from Neuchâtel</span>
				<span class='text'>On July 11, 1762, Rousseau wrote to Frederick, describing how he had been driven from France, from Geneva, and from Bern; and seeking Frederick's protection</span>
				<span class='text'>He also mentioned that he had criticized Frederick in the past and would continue to be critical of Frederick in the future, stating however: &quot;Your Majesty may dispose of me as you like</span>

				<span class='text'>lthough it was within the [[Canton of Bern]], from where he was expelled two years ago, he was informally assured that he could move into this island house without fear of arrest, and he did so</span>

				<span class='text'>Published in 1762, it became one of the most influential works of political philosophy in the Western tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>It developed some of the ideas mentioned in an earlier work, the article ''Economie Politique'' (''Discourse on Political Economy''), featured in Diderot's ''[[Encyclopédie]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>Those who think themselves the masters of others are indeed greater slaves than they</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Rousseau claimed that the state of nature was a primitive condition without law or morality, which human beings left for the benefits and necessity of cooperation</span>
				<span class='text'>As society developed, division of labor and private property required the human race to adopt institutions of law</span>

				<span class='text'>ccording to Rousseau, by joining together into civil society through the [[social contract]] and abandoning their claims of [[Natural and legal rights|natural right]], individuals can both preserve themselves and remain free</span>
				<span class='text'>This is because submission to the authority of the [[general will]] of the people as a whole guarantees individuals against being subordinated to the wills of others and also ensures that they obey themselves because they are, collectively, the authors of the law</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough Rousseau argues that [[sovereignty]] (or the power to make the laws) should be in the hands of the people, he also makes a sharp distinction between the sovereign and the government</span>
				<span class='text'>The government is composed of magistrates, charged with implementing and enforcing the general will</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;sovereign&quot; is the rule of law, ideally decided on by [[direct democracy]] in an assembly</span>
				<span class='text'>ousseau opposed the idea that the people should exercise sovereignty via a [[Representative democracy|representative assembly]] (Book III, Chapter XV)</span>
				<span class='text'>He approved the kind of republican government of the city-state, for which Geneva provided a model - or would have done if renewed on Rousseau's principles</span>
				<span class='text'>France could not meet Rousseau's criterion of an ideal state because it was too big</span>
				<span class='text'>Much subsequent controversy about Rousseau's work has hinged on disagreements concerning his claims that citizens constrained to obey the general will are thereby rendered free:&lt;blockquote&gt;The notion of the general will is wholly central to Rousseau's theory of political legitimacy</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>It is, however, an unfortunately obscure and controversial notion</span>
				<span class='text'>Some commentators see it as no more than the dictatorship of the proletariat or the tyranny of the urban poor (such as may perhaps be seen in the French Revolution)</span>
				<span class='text'>Such was not Rousseau's meaning</span>
				<span class='text'>This is clear from the ''Discourse on Political Economy'', where Rousseau emphasizes that the general will exists to protect individuals against the mass, not to require them to be sacrificed to it</span>
				<span class='text'>He is, of course, sharply aware that men have selfish and sectional interests which will lead them to try to oppress others</span>
				<span class='text'>It is for this reason that loyalty to the good of all alike must be a supreme (although not exclusive) commitment by everyone, not only if a truly general will is to be heeded but also if it is to be formulated successfully in the first place&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>t the time, however, Rousseau's strong endorsement of religious toleration, as expounded by the Savoyard vicar in ''[[Emile: or, On Education|Émile]]'', was interpreted as advocating [[indifferentism]], a heresy, and led to the condemnation of the book in both Calvinist [[Geneva]] and Catholic Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>His assertion in ''[[The Social Contract]]'' that true followers of Jesus would not make good citizens may have been another reason for Rousseau's condemnation in Geneva</span>
				<span class='text'>nlike many of the more radical Enlightenment philosophers, Rousseau affirmed the necessity of religion</span>
				<span class='text'>But he repudiated the doctrine of [[original sin]], which plays so large a part in Calvinism (in ''Émile'', Rousseau writes &quot;there is no original perversity in the human heart&quot;)</span>

				<span class='text'>Rousseau's [[deism]] differed from the usual kind in its intense emotionality</span>
				<span class='text'>He saw the presence of God in his creation, including mankind, which, apart from the harmful influence of society, is good, because God is good</span>
				<span class='text'>Rousseau's attribution of a spiritual value to the beauty of nature anticipates the attitudes of 19th-century [[Romanticism]] towards nature and religion</span>
				<span class='text'>ousseau was upset that his deistic views were so forcefully condemned, while those of the more atheistic ''philosophes'' were ignored</span>

				<span class='text'>]===General Will===Rousseau’s idea of the ''volonté générale'' (‘[[general will]]’) was not original with him but rather belonged to a well-established technical vocabulary of juridical and theological writings in use at the time</span>
				<span class='text'> The phrase was used by [[Diderot]] and also by [[Montesquieu]] (and by his teacher, the [[Oratory of Jesus|Oratorian]] friar [[Nicolas Malebranche]])</span>
				<span class='text'> It served to designate the common interest embodied in legal tradition, as distinct from and transcending people’s private and particular interests at any particular time</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed |date=September 2015}}The concept was also an important aspect of the more radical 17th-century republican tradition of [[Spinoza]], from whom Rousseau differed in important respects, but not in his insistence on the importance of equality:{{Quote | While Rousseau's notion of the progressive moral degeneration of mankind from the moment civil society established itself diverges markedly from Spinoza's claim that human nature is always and everywhere the same… for both philosophers the pristine equality of the state of nature is our ultimate goal and criterion… in shaping the ‘common good’, ''volonté générale'', or [[Spinoza]]'s ''mens una'', which alone can ensure stability and political salvation</span>
				<span class='text'>Without the supreme criterion of equality, the general will would indeed be meaningless</span>
				<span class='text'>[…] When in the depths of the French Revolution the Jacobin clubs all over France regularly deployed Rousseau when demanding radical reforms</span>
				<span class='text'>and especially anything—such as land redistribution—designed to enhance equality, they were at the same time, albeit unconsciously, invoking a radical tradition which reached back to the late seventeenth century</span>

				<span class='text'>The revolutionaries were also inspired by Rousseau to introduce Deism as the new official [[civil religion]] of France:{{Quote | Ceremonial and symbolic occurrences of the more radical phases of the Revolution invoked Rousseau and his core ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus the ceremony held at the site of the demolished Bastille, organized by the foremost artistic director of the Revolution, [[Jacques-Louis David]], in August 1793 to mark the inauguration of the new republican constitution, an event coming shortly after the final abolition of all forms of feudal privilege, featured a cantata based on Rousseau's democratic pantheistic deism as expounded in the celebrated ‘''Profession de foi d’un vicaire savoyard''’ in Book Four of ''Émile''</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Israel | 2002 | p = 717}}}}===Effect on the United States of America===According to some scholars, Rousseau exercised minimal influence on the American founders like Thomas Jefferson despite the similarities between their ideas, such as shared beliefs regarding the self-evidence of the claim that &quot;all men are created equal,&quot; their shared conviction that citizens of a republic be educated at public expense, and the evident parallel between the U</span>

				<span class='text'>]The first to criticize Rousseau were his fellow ''[[Philosophe]]s'', above all, Voltaire</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Jacques Barzun, Voltaire was annoyed by the [[Discourse on the Arts and Sciences|first discourse]], and outraged by the [[Discourse on Inequality|second]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Voltaire's reading of the second discourse was that Rousseau would like the reader to &quot;walk on all fours&quot; befitting a savage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life: 1500 to the Present'' (Harper Collins, 2001), p</span>
				<span class='text'>384&lt;/ref&gt;[[Jacques Barzun|Barzun]] states that, contrary to myth, Rousseau was no primitivist; for him:&lt;blockquote&gt;The model man is the independent farmer, free of superiors and self-governing</span>
				<span class='text'>This was cause enough for the ''philosophes''' hatred of their former friend</span>
				<span class='text'>Rousseau's unforgivable crime was his rejection of the graces and luxuries of civilized existence</span>
				<span class='text'>Voltaire had sung &quot;The superfluous, that most necessary thing</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; For the high bourgeois standard of living Rousseau would substitute the middling peasant's</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the country versus the city—an exasperating idea for them, as was the amazing fact that every new work of Rousseau's was a huge success, whether the subject was politics, theater, education, religion, or a novel about love</span>
