				<span class='text'>Following his father's March 1963 suicide, Turner became president and chief executive of Turner Advertising Company when he was 24&lt;ref name=bibb5556/&gt; and turned the firm into a global enterprise</span>
				<span class='text'>He joined the [[Young Republicans]], saying &quot;he felt at ease among these budding conservatives and was merely following in Ed Turner's far-right footsteps,&quot; according to ''It Ain't As Easy As It Looks''</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right]]During the [[Vietnam War]] Era, Turner‚Äôs business prospered; it ‚Äúhad virtual monopolies in Savannah, Macon, Columbus,{{clarify|date=December 2012}} and Charleston‚Äù and was ‚Äúthe largest outdoor advertising company in the Southeast‚Äù, according to ''It Ain‚Äôt As Easy As It Looks''</span>
				<span class='text'>The book observed that Turner ‚Äúdiscovered his father had sheltered a substantial amount of taxable income over the years by personally lending it back to the company‚Äù and ‚Äúdiscovered that the billboard business could be a gold mine, a tax-depreciable revenue stream that threw off enormous amounts of cash with almost no capital investment‚Äù</span>
				<span class='text'>In the late 1960s, Turner used the profits to buy Southern radio stations</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=October 2014}}In 1969, he sold his several radio stations to buy a struggling television station in Atlanta, WJRJ, Channel 17</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time, UHF stations did well only in markets without VHF stations, like [[Fresno, California]], or in markets with only one station on VHF</span>
				<span class='text'>Independent UHF stations were not ratings winners or that profitable even in larger markets, but Turner had the foresight that this would change as people wanted more than several choices</span>
				<span class='text'>He changed the [[call sign]] to WTCG (standing for &quot;Watch This Channel Grow&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially, the station ran old movies from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, along with theatrical cartoons and very old sitcoms and old drama shows</span>
				<span class='text'>As better syndicated product fell off the VHF stations, Turner would pick it up for his station at a very low price</span>
				<span class='text'>WTCG ran mostly second- and even third-hand product of the time, including fare such as [[Gilligan's Island]], [[I Love Lucy]], [[Star Trek]], [[Hazel]], and [[Bugs Bunny]]</span>
				<span class='text'>WTCG acquired rights to telecast the [[Atlanta Braves]] baseball games in 1973</span>
				<span class='text'>Turner also purchased UHF Channel 36 [[WCNC-TV|WRET]] (now WCNC) in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] and ran it with a format similar to WTCG</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1976, the FCC allowed Turner‚Äôs WTCG to use a satellite to transmit content to local cable TV providers around the nation</span>
				<span class='text'>On December 17, 1976, the rechristened WTCG-TV Super-Station began to broadcast old movies, [[situation comedy]] reruns, cartoons, and sports nationwide to cable-TV subscribers</span>
				<span class='text'>As cable systems developed, many carried his station to free their schedules</span>
				<span class='text'>This increased his viewers and advertising</span>
				<span class='text'>Subscribers eventually reached two million subscribers and Turner's net worth rose to $100&amp;nbsp;million</span>
				<span class='text'>He bought a {{convert|5000|acre|km2|sing=on}} plantation in Jacksonboro, South Carolina, for $2&amp;nbsp;million</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=October 2014}}In 1978, Turner struck a deal with a student-operated radio station at [[MIT]], [[Technology Broadcasting System]] to obtain the rights to the WTBS call sign for $50,000</span>
				<span class='text'>This allowed Turner to strengthen the branding of his &quot;Super-Station&quot; using the [[acronym]] TBS; Turner Communications Group was renamed [[Turner Broadcasting System]] and WTCG was renamed as [[WPCH-TV|WTBS]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1976, Turner bought the [[Atlanta Braves]] and [[Atlanta Hawks]], partially to provide programming for WTCG</span>
				<span class='text'>Using the rechristened WTBS' superstation status to beam Braves games into nearly every home in North America, Turner made the Braves a household name even before their run of success in the 1990s and early 2000s</span>
				<span class='text'>At one point, he suggested to pitcher [[Andy Messersmith]], who wore number 17, that he change his surname to &quot;Channel&quot; to promote the television station</span>
