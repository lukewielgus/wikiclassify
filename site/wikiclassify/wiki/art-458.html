				<span class='text'>But even after their separation, Lou continued to be Rilke's most important confidante until the end of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Having trained from 1912 to 1913 as a [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] with [[Sigmund Freud]], she shared her knowledge of psychoanalysis with Rilke</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1898, Rilke undertook a journey lasting several weeks to Italy</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1900, Rilke stayed at the artists' colony at [[Worpswede]]</span>
				<span class='text'>(Later, his portrait would be painted by the proto-expressionist [[Paula Modersohn-Becker]], whom he got to know at Worpswede</span>
				<span class='text'> It was here that he got to know the sculptor [[Clara Westhoff]], whom he married the following year</span>

				<span class='text'>]In the summer of 1902, Rilke left home and travelled to Paris to write a [[monograph]] on the sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Before long his wife left their daughter with her parents and joined Rilke there</span>
				<span class='text'>The relationship between Rilke and Clara Westhoff continued for the rest of his life; a mutually agreed-upon effort at divorce was bureaucratically hindered by Rilke's &quot;official&quot; status as a Catholic, though a non-practising one</span>
				<span class='text'>t first, Rilke had a difficult time in Paris, an experience that he called on in the first part of his only novel, ''[[The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, his encounter with modernism was very stimulating: Rilke became deeply involved in the sculpture of Rodin, and then with the work of [[Paul C√©zanne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For a time, he acted as Rodin's secretary, also lecturing and writing a long essay on Rodin and his work</span>
				<span class='text'>Rodin taught him the value of objective observation, and under this influence, Rilke dramatically transformed his poetic style from the subjective and sometimes incantatory language of his earlier work into something quite new in European literature</span>
				<span class='text'>The result was the ''[[New Poems]]'', famous for the &quot;thing-poems&quot; expressing Rilke's rejuvenated artistic vision</span>
				<span class='text'>During these years, Paris increasingly became the writer's main residence</span>
				<span class='text'>he most important works of the Paris period were ''Neue Gedichte'' (''New Poems'') (1907), ''Der Neuen Gedichte Anderer Teil'' (''Another Part of the New Poems'') (1908), the two &quot;Requiem&quot; poems (1909), and the novel ''The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge'', started in 1904 and completed in January 1910</span>
				<span class='text'>uring the later part of this decade, Rilke spent extended periods in [[Ronda]], the famous bullfighting centre in southern Spain</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Duino Castle near Trieste, Italy, was where Rilke began writing the ''Duino Elegies'' in 1912‚Äîrecounting that he heard the famous first line as a voice in the wind while walking along the cliffs and that he wrote it quickly in his notebook</span>
				<span class='text'>]Between October 1911 and May 1912, Rilke stayed at the Castle [[Duino]], near [[Trieste]], home of [[Czech branch of the House of Thurn and Taxis#Alexander and Marie von Thurn und Taxis|Princess Marie]] of [[Thurn und Taxis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There, in 1912, he began the poem cycle called the ''[[Duino Elegies]]'', which would remain unfinished for a decade because of a long-lasting creativity crisis</span>
				<span class='text'>The outbreak of [[World War I]] surprised Rilke during a stay in Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>He was unable to return to Paris, where his property was confiscated and auctioned</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent the greater part of the war in Munich</span>
				<span class='text'>From 1914 to 1916 he had a turbulent affair with the painter [[Lou Albert-Lasard]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Rilke was called up at the beginning of 1916, and he had to undertake basic training in Vienna</span>
				<span class='text'>Influential friends interceded on his behalf, and he was transferred to the War Records Office and discharged from the military on 9 June 1916</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent the subsequent time once again in Munich, interrupted by a stay on [[:de:Hertha Koenig|Hertha Koenig]]'s Gut Bockel in Westphalia</span>
				<span class='text'>The traumatic experience of military service, a reminder of the horrors of the military academy, almost completely silenced him as a poet</span>

				<span class='text'>]On 11 June 1919, Rilke traveled from Munich to Switzerland</span>
				<span class='text'>The outward motive was an invitation to lecture in Zurich, but the real reason was the wish to escape the post-war chaos and take up his work on the ''Duino Elegies'' once again</span>
				<span class='text'>The search for a suitable and affordable place to live proved to be very difficult</span>
				<span class='text'>Among other places, Rilke lived in Soglio, [[Locarno]], and Berg am Irchel</span>
				<span class='text'>Only in mid-1921 was he able to find a permanent residence in the Ch√¢teau de Muzot in the commune of [[Veyras, Switzerland|Veyras]], close to [[Sierre]] in Valais</span>
				<span class='text'>In an intense creative period, Rilke completed the ''Duino Elegies'' in several weeks in February 1922</span>
				<span class='text'>Before and after, Rilke rapidly wrote both parts of the poem cycle ''[[Sonnets to Orpheus]]'' containing 55 entire sonnets</span>
				<span class='text'>Both works together have often been taken as constituting the high points of Rilke's work</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1922, Rilke's patron [[Werner Reinhart]] bought and renovated Muzot so that Rilke could live there rent-free</span>

				<span class='text'>==''The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge''==={{See also|The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge}}Rilke wrote his only novel, ''{{Lang|de|Die Aufzeichnungen des Malte Laurids Brigge}}'' (translated as ''The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge''), while living in Paris and completed the work in 1910</span>
				<span class='text'>The novel is semi-autobiographical, and he adopts the style and technique that became associated with the [[Expressionism]] that entered European fiction and art in the early 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>Rilke was inspired by [[Sigbj√∏rn Obstfelder]]'s work ''[[A Priest's Diary]]'' and [[Jens Peter Jacobsen]]'s second novel ''Niels Lyhne'' (1880) which traces the fate of an [[Atheism|atheist]] in a merciless world</span>
				<span class='text'>Rilke addresses existential themes, profoundly probing the quest for individuality, the significance of death, and reflection on the experience of time as death approaches</span>
				<span class='text'>Rilke draws considerably on the writings of Nietzsche, whose work he came to know through his lover, Nietzsche's former lover Lou-Andreas Salome</span>
				<span class='text'>His work also incorporates impressionistic techniques that were influenced by the painter [[Paul C√©zanne|C√©zanne]], and sculptor [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] (whose secretary Rilke was 1905‚Äì1906)</span>
				<span class='text'>He combines these techniques and motifs to conjure images of mankind's anxiety and alienation in the face of an increasingly scientific, industrial, reified world</span>
				<span class='text'>==''Duino Elegies''==={{See also|Duino Elegies}}Rilke began writing the elegies in 1912 while a guest of Princess Marie von Thurn und Taxis (1855‚Äì1934) at [[Duino Castle]], near [[Trieste]] on the [[Adriatic Sea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During this ten-year period, the elegies languished incomplete for long stretches of time as Rilke suffered frequently from severe [[Depression (mood)|depression]]‚Äîsome of which was caused by the events of [[World War I]] and his [[Conscription|conscripted military service]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Aside from brief episodes of writing in 1913 and 1915, Rilke did not return to the work until a few years after the war ended</span>
				<span class='text'>With a sudden, renewed inspiration‚Äîwriting in a frantic pace he described as &quot;a savage creative storm&quot;‚Äîhe completed the collection in February 1922 while staying at [[Ch√¢teau de Muzot]] in [[Veyras, Switzerland|Veyras]], in Switzerland's [[Rhone]] Valley</span>
				<span class='text'>After their publication and his death shortly thereafter, the ''Duino Elegies'' were quickly recognized by critics and scholars as Rilke's most important work</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The poems employ a rich symbolism of [[angel]]s and [[salvation]] but not in keeping with typical [[Christianity|Christian]] interpretations</span>
				<span class='text'>Rilke begins the first elegy in an invocation of philosophical despair, asking: &quot;Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the hierarchies of angels?&quot; (''Wer, wenn ich schriee, h√∂rte mich denn aus der Engel Ordnungen?'')&lt;ref&gt;Rilke, Rainer Maria</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HoenigerSymbolismArticle1939&quot; /&gt;  Together, the ''Duino Elegies'' are described as a metamorphosis of Rilke's &quot;[[Ontology|ontological]] torment&quot; and an &quot;impassioned monologue about coming to terms with human existence&quot; discussing themes of &quot;the limitations and insufficiency of the human condition and fractured human consciousness&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'> For the next few days, he focused on the ''Duino Elegies'', completing them on the evening of 11 February</span>
				<span class='text'> Immediately after, he returned to work on the ''Sonnets'' and completed the following section of 29 sonnets in less than two weeks</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the ''Sonnets'', Wera appears in frequent references to her both direct where he addresses her by name and indirect as allusions to a &quot;dancer&quot; or the mythical [[Eurydice]]</span>

				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|upright|''Letters to a Young Poet'', cover of the 1934 edition]]{{See also|Letters to a Young Poet}}In 1929, a minor writer, [[Franz Xaver Kappus]] (1883‚Äì1966), published a collection of ten letters that Rilke had written to him when he was a 19-year-old officer cadet studying at the [[Theresian Military Academy]] in [[Wiener Neustadt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The young Kappus wrote to Rilke, who had also attended the academy, between 1902 and 1908 when he was uncertain about his future career as a military officer or as a poet</span>
				<span class='text'> Initially, he sought Rilke's advice as to the quality of his poetry, and whether he ought to pursue writing as a career</span>
				<span class='text'> While he declined to comment on Kappus's writings, Rilke advised Kappus on how a poet should feel, love, and seek truth in trying to understand and experience the world around him and engage the world of art</span>
				<span class='text'> These letters offer insight into the ideas and themes that appear in Rilke's poetry and his working process</span>
				<span class='text'> Further, these letters were written during a key period of Rilke's early artistic development after his reputation as a poet began to be established with the publication of parts of ''[[The Book of Hours|Das Stunden-Buch]]'' (''The Book of Hours'') and ''[[The Book of Images|Das Buch der Bilder]]'' (''The Book of Images'')</span>
