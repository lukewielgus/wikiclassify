				<span class='text'>Kant took himself to have effected a [[Copernican revolution]] in [[philosophy]], akin to [[Copernicus]]' reversal of the [[geocentric model|age-old belief]] that the [[sun]] revolved around the [[earth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His beliefs continue to have a major influence on contemporary philosophy, especially the fields of [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[political theory]], and [[aesthetics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ant in his [[critical philosophy|critical phase]] sought to 'reverse' the orientation of pre-critical philosophy by showing how the traditional problems of [[metaphysics]] can be overcome by supposing that the agreement between [[reality]] and the [[concepts]] we use to conceive it arises not because our mental concepts have come to passively mirror reality, but because reality must conform to the human mind's active concepts to be conceivable and at all possible for us to experience</span>
				<span class='text'>Kant thus regarded the basic categories of the [[human mind]] as the [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] &quot;[[condition of possibility]]&quot; for any [[experience]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In his view, the mind shapes and structures experience so that, on an abstract level, all human experience shares certain essential structural features</span>

				<span class='text'>Kant published other important works on ethics, religion, law, aesthetics, astronomy, and history</span>
				<span class='text'>These included the ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'' (''Kritik der praktischen Vernunft'', 1788), the ''[[Metaphysics of Morals]]'' (''Die Metaphysik der Sitten'', 1797), which dealt with [[ethics]], and the ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' (''Kritik der Urteilskraft'', 1790), which looks at [[aesthetics]] and [[teleology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ant aimed to resolve disputes between [[Empiricism|empirical]] and [[Rationalism|rationalist]] approaches</span>
				<span class='text'>The former asserted that all knowledge comes through experience; the latter maintained that reason and innate ideas were prior</span>
				<span class='text'>Kant argued that experience is purely subjective without first being processed by pure reason</span>
				<span class='text'>He also said that using reason without applying it to experience only leads to theoretical illusions</span>
				<span class='text'>The free and proper exercise of reason by the individual was a theme both of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and of Kant's approaches to the various problems of philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>His ideas influenced many thinkers in Germany during his lifetime, and he moved philosophy beyond the debate between the rationalists and empiricists</span>

				<span class='text'>Thus he tried to explain the order of the solar system, which [[Isaac Newton]] had explained as imposed from the beginning by God</span>
				<span class='text'>Kant also correctly deduced that the [[Milky Way]] was a large disk of stars, which he theorized also formed from a (much larger) spinning cloud of gas</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/wiki/Kant%27s_Inaugural_Dissertation_of_1770 De Mundi Sensibilis atque Intelligibilis Forma et Principiis (On the Form and Principles of the Sensible and the Intelligible World)]''</span>
				<span class='text'>This work saw the emergence of several central themes of his mature work, including the distinction between the faculties of intellectual thought and sensible receptivity</span>
				<span class='text'>To miss this distinction would mean to commit the error of [[subreption]], and, as he says in the last chapter of the dissertation, only in avoiding this error does metaphysics flourish</span>
				<span class='text'>he issue that vexed Kant was central to what 20th-century scholars called &quot;the [[philosophy of mind]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The flowering of the natural sciences had led to an understanding of how data reaches the brain</span>
				<span class='text'>Sunlight falling on an object is reflected from its surface in a way that maps the surface features (color, texture, etc</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The reflected light reaches the human eye, passes through the cornea, is focused by the lens onto the retina where it forms an image similar to that formed by light passing through a pinhole into a [[camera obscura]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The retinal cells send impulses through the [[optic nerve]] and then they form a mapping in the brain of the visual features of the object</span>
				<span class='text'>The interior mapping is not the exterior object, and our belief that there is a meaningful relationship between the object and the mapping in the brain depends on a chain of reasoning that is not fully grounded</span>
				<span class='text'>But the uncertainty aroused by these considerations, by optical illusions, misperceptions, delusions, etc</span>
				<span class='text'> are not the end of the problems</span>
				<span class='text'>ant saw that the mind could not function as an empty container that simply receives data from outside</span>
				<span class='text'>Something must be giving order to the incoming data</span>
				<span class='text'>Images of external objects must be kept in the same sequence in which they were received</span>
				<span class='text'>This ordering occurs through the mind's intuition of time</span>
				<span class='text'>The same considerations apply to the mind's function of constituting '''space''' for ordering mappings of visual and tactile signals arriving via the already described chains of physical causation</span>
				<span class='text'>t is often claimed that Kant was a late developer, that he only became an important philosopher in his mid-50s after rejecting his earlier views</span>
				<span class='text'>While it is true that Kant wrote his greatest works relatively late in life, there is a tendency to underestimate the value of his earlier works</span>
				<span class='text'>Recent Kant scholarship has devoted more attention to these &quot;pre-critical&quot; writings and has recognized a degree of continuity with his mature work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cf</span>
				<span class='text'> for example, Susan Shell, ''The Embodiment of Reason'' (Chicago, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;===The silent decade===At age 46, Kant was an established scholar and an increasingly influential philosopher</span>
				<span class='text'>Much was expected of him</span>
				<span class='text'>In correspondence with his ex-student and friend [[Markus Herz]], Kant admitted that, in the ''Inaugural Dissertation'', he had failed to account for the relation between our sensible and intellectual faculties—he needed to explain how we combine sensory knowledge with reasoned knowledge, these being related but very different processes</span>
				<span class='text'>He also credited [[David Hume]] with awakening him from &quot;dogmatic slumber&quot; (circa 1771)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;http://hardproblem</span>
				<span class='text'>u/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Vasilyev-The-Origin</span>
				<span class='text'>df&lt;/ref&gt; Hume had stated that experience consists only of sequences of feelings, images or sounds</span>
				<span class='text'>Ideas such as &quot;cause&quot;, goodness, or objects were not evident in experience, so why do we believe in the reality of these?  Kant felt that reason could remove this skepticism, and he set himself to solving these problems</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not publish any work in philosophy for the next 11 years</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Immanuel Kant 3</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Immanuel Kant]]Although fond of company and conversation with others, Kant isolated himself</span>
				<span class='text'>He resisted friends' attempts to bring him out of his isolation</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1778, in response to one of these offers by a former pupil, Kant wrote::&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Any change makes me apprehensive, even if it offers the greatest promise of improving my condition, and I am persuaded by this natural instinct of mine that I must take heed if I wish that the threads which the Fates spin so thin and weak in my case to be spun to any length</span>

				<span class='text'>{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}  ISBN 1-84046-664-2&lt;/ref&gt;When Kant emerged from his silence in 1781, the result was the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Although now uniformly recognized as one of the greatest works in the history of philosophy, this ''Critique'' was largely ignored upon its initial publication</span>
				<span class='text'>The book was long, over 800 pages in the original German edition, and written in a convoluted style</span>
				<span class='text'>It received few reviews, and these granted it no significance</span>
				<span class='text'>Kant's former student, [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] criticized it for placing reason as an entity worthy of criticism instead of considering the process of reasoning within the context of language and one's entire personality</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Kant was disappointed with the first Critique's reception</span>
				<span class='text'>Recognizing the need to clarify the original treatise, Kant wrote the ''[[Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics]]'' in 1783 as a summary of its main views</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly thereafter, Kant's friend Johann Friedrich Schultz (1739–1805) (professor of mathematics) published ''Erläuterungen über des Herrn Professor Kant Critik der reinen Vernunft'' (Königsberg, 1784), which was a brief but very accurate commentary on Kant's ''Critique of Pure Reason''</span>
				<span class='text'>ant's reputation gradually rose through the latter portion of the 1780s, sparked by a series of important works: the 1784 essay, &quot;[[What is Enlightenment?|Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment?]]&quot;; 1785's ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' (his first work on moral philosophy); and, from 1786, ''[[Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' But Kant's fame ultimately arrived from an unexpected source</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1786, [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]] published a series of public letters on Kantian philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>In these letters, Reinhold framed Kant's philosophy as a response to the central intellectual controversy of the era: the [[Pantheism Dispute]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Friedrich Jacobi]] had accused the recently deceased [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] (a distinguished dramatist and philosophical essayist) of [[Spinozism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Such a charge, tantamount to atheism, was vigorously denied by Lessing's friend [[Moses Mendelssohn]], leading to a bitter public dispute among partisans</span>
				<span class='text'>The controversy gradually escalated into a debate about the values of the Enlightenment and the value of reason</span>
				<span class='text'>Reinhold maintained in his letters that Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' could settle this dispute by defending the authority and bounds of reason</span>
				<span class='text'>Reinhold's letters were widely read and made Kant the most famous philosopher of his era</span>
				<span class='text'>==Mature work===Kant published a second edition of the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (''[[Kritik der reinen Vernunft]]'') in 1787, heavily revising the first parts of the book</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of his subsequent work focused on other areas of philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued to develop his moral philosophy, notably in 1788's ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'' (known as the second ''Critique'') and 1797's ''[[Metaphysics of Morals]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1790 ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' (the third ''Critique'') applied the Kantian system to aesthetics and [[teleology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1792, Kant's attempt to publish the Second of the four Pieces of ''[[Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason]]'', in the journal ''Berlinische Monatsschrift'', met with opposition from the King's [[censorship]] commission, which had been established that same year in the context of the [[French Revolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DerridaKantCensorship&quot;/&gt; Kant then arranged to have all four pieces published as a book, routing it through the philosophy department at the University of Jena to avoid the need for theological censorship</span>

				<span class='text'>44</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This insubordination earned him a now famous reprimand from the King</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DerridaKantCensorship&quot;/&gt; When he nevertheless published a second edition in 1794, the censor was so irate that he arranged for a royal order that required Kant never to publish or even speak publicly about religion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DerridaKantCensorship&quot;/&gt; Kant then published his response to the King's reprimand and explained himself, in the preface of ''The Conflict of the Faculties''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;DerridaKantCensorship&quot;/&gt;He also wrote a number of semi-popular essays on history, religion, politics and other topics</span>
				<span class='text'>These works were well received by Kant's contemporaries and confirmed his preeminent status in 18th-century philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>There were several journals devoted solely to defending and criticizing Kantian philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his success, philosophical trends were moving in another direction</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of Kant's most important disciples (including [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold|Reinhold]], [[Jakob Sigismund Beck|Beck]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]]) transformed the Kantian position into increasingly radical forms of idealism</span>
				<span class='text'>The progressive stages of revision of Kant's teachings marked the emergence of [[German Idealism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Kant opposed these developments and publicly denounced Fichte in an open letter in 1799</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1800, a student of Kant named Gottlob Benjamin Jäsche (1762–1842) published a manual of logic for teachers called ''Logik'', which he had prepared at Kant's request</span>
				<span class='text'>Jäsche prepared the ''Logik'' using a copy of a textbook in logic by Georg Freidrich Meier entitled ''Auszug aus der Vernunftlehre'', in which Kant had written copious notes and annotations</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Logik'' has been considered of fundamental importance to Kant's philosophy, and the understanding of it</span>
				<span class='text'>The great 19th-century logician [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] remarked, in an incomplete review of [[Thomas Kingsmill Abbott]]'s English translation of the introduction to ''Logik'', that &quot;Kant's whole philosophy turns upon his logic</span>

				<span class='text'> In the self-governance model of Aristotelian virtue, the non-rational part of the soul can be made to listen to reason through training</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Kantian self-governance appears to involve &quot;a rational crackdown on appetites and emotions&quot; with lack of harmony between reason and emotion, Kantian virtue denies requiring &quot;self-conquest, self-suppression, or self-silencing&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>They dispute that &quot;the self-mastery constitutive of virtue is ultimately mastery over our tendency of will to give priority to appetite or emotion unregulated by duty, it does not require extirpating, suppressing, or silencing sensibility in general&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumbnail| Immanuel Kant by [[Carle Vernet]] (1758-1836) ]]In Kant's essay &quot;[[What is Enlightenment?|Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?]]&quot;,Kant defined the Enlightenment as an age shaped by the [[Latin]] motto ''[[Sapere aude]]'' (&quot;Dare to be wise&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Kant maintained that one ought to think autonomously, free of the dictates of external [[authority]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His work reconciled many of the differences between the [[rationalism|rationalist]] and [[empiricism|empiricist]] traditions of the 18th century</span>
				<span class='text'>He had a decisive impact on the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and [[German Idealism|German Idealist]] philosophies of the 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'>His work has also been a starting point for many 20th century philosophers</span>
				<span class='text'>ant asserted that, because of the limitations of argumentation in the absence of irrefutable [[Evidence#Evidence in Problems|evidence]], no one could really know whether there is a God and an afterlife or not</span>
				<span class='text'>For the sake of morality and as a ground for reason, Kant asserted, people are justified in believing in God, even though they could never know God's presence empirically</span>
				<span class='text'>He explained:{{quote|text=All the preparations of reason, therefore, in what may be called pure philosophy, are in reality directed to those three problems only [God, the soul, and freedom]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, these three elements in themselves still hold independent, proportional, objective weight individually</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, in a collective relational context; namely, to know ''what ought to be done'': if the will is free, if there is a God, and if there is a future [[world (philosophy)|world]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As this concerns our actions with reference to the highest aims of life, we see that the ultimate intention of nature in her wise provision was really, in the constitution of our reason, directed to moral interests only</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;CPR A801&quot;&gt;''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A801</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}The sense of an enlightened approach and the [[scientific method|critical method]] required that &quot;If one cannot prove that a thing ''is,'' he may try to prove that it is ''not</span>
				<span class='text'>' If he fails to do neither (as often occurs), he may still ask whether it is in his ''interest'' to ''accept'' one or the other of the alternatives hypothetically, from the theoretical or the practical point of view</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence the question no longer is as to whether [[perpetual peace]] is a real thing or not a real thing, or as to whether we may not be deceiving ourselves when we adopt the former alternative, but we must ''act'' on the supposition of its being real</span>

				<span class='text'>This, however, is possible in an intelligible world only under a wise author and ruler</span>
				<span class='text'>Reason compels us to admit such a ruler, together with life in such a world, which we must consider as future life, or else all moral laws are to be considered as idle dreams</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Kant claimed to have created a &quot;[[Copernican Revolution (metaphor)|Copernican revolution]]&quot; in philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>This involved two interconnected foundations of his &quot;[[critical philosophy]]&quot;:* the [[epistemology]] of [[transcendental idealism]] and* the [[moral philosophy]] of the autonomy of practical reason</span>
				<span class='text'>hese teachings placed the active, rational human [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] at the center of the cognitive and moral worlds</span>
				<span class='text'>Kant argued that the rational order of the world as known by science was not just the accidental accumulation of sense perceptions</span>
				<span class='text'>onceptual unification and integration is carried out by the mind through [[concept]]s or the &quot;categories of the understanding&quot; operating on the perceptual manifold within [[space and time]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter are not concepts,&lt;ref&gt;In the first edition of the ''Critique of Pure Reason'' Kant refers to space as &quot;no discursive or</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>eneral conception of the relation of things, but a pure intuition&quot; and maintained that &quot;We can only represent to ourselves one space&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;general notion of spaces</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>epends solely upon limitations&quot; (Meikeljohn trans</span>
				<span class='text'> A25)</span>
				<span class='text'>In the second edition of the CPR, Kant adds, &quot;The original representation of space is an ''a priori'' intuition, not a concept&quot; (Kemp Smith trans</span>
				<span class='text'> B40)</span>
				<span class='text'>In regard to time, Kant states that &quot;Time is not a discursive, or what is called a general concept, but a pure form of sensible intuition</span>
				<span class='text'>Different times are but parts of one and the same time; and the representation which can be given only through a single object is intuition&quot; (A31/B47)</span>
				<span class='text'>For the differences in the discursive use of reason according to concepts and its intuitive use through the construction of concepts, see ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (A719/B747 ff</span>
				<span class='text'>and A837/B865)</span>
				<span class='text'>On &quot;One and the same thing in space and time&quot; and the mathematical construction of concepts, see A724/B752</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; but are forms of sensibility that are ''a priori'' necessary conditions for any possible experience</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus the objective order of nature and the causal necessity that operates within it depend on the mind's processes, the product of the rule-based activity that Kant called, &quot;[[A priori and a posteriori|synthesis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; There is much discussion among Kant scholars about the correct interpretation of this train of thought</span>
				<span class='text'>he 'two-world' interpretation regards Kant's position as a statement of epistemological limitation, that we are not able to transcend the bounds of our own mind, meaning that we cannot access the &quot;[[thing-in-itself]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Kant also speaks of the thing in itself or ''transcendental object'' as a product of the (human) understanding as it attempts to conceive of objects in abstraction from the conditions of sensibility</span>
				<span class='text'>Following this line of thought, some interpreters have argued that the thing in itself does not represent a separate ontological domain but simply a way of considering objects by means of the understanding alone{{spaced ndash}}this is known as the two-aspect view</span>
				<span class='text'>he notion of the &quot;[[thing in itself]]&quot; was much discussed by philosophers after Kant</span>
				<span class='text'>It was argued that because the &quot;thing in itself&quot; was unknowable, its existence must not be assumed</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather than arbitrarily switching to an account that was ungrounded in anything supposed to be the &quot;real,&quot; as did the German Idealists, another group arose to ask how our (presumably reliable) accounts of a coherent and rule-abiding universe were actually grounded</span>
				<span class='text'>This new kind of philosophy became known as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]], and its founder was [[Edmund Husserl]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ith regard to [[morality]], Kant argued that the source of the [[Goodness and value theory|good]] lies not in anything outside the [[human]] subject, either in [[nature]] or given by [[God]], but rather is only the good will itself</span>
				<span class='text'>A good will is one that acts from duty in accordance with the universal moral law that the autonomous human being freely gives itself</span>
				<span class='text'>This law obliges one to treat humanity{{spaced ndash}}understood as rational agency, and represented through oneself as well as others{{spaced ndash}}as an [[end in itself]] rather than (merely) as [[means (philosophy)|means]] to other ends the individual might hold</span>
				<span class='text'>This necessitates practical self-reflection in which we universalize our reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>hese ideas have largely framed or influenced all subsequent philosophical discussion and analysis</span>
				<span class='text'>The specifics of Kant's account generated immediate and lasting controversy</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, his theses{{spaced ndash}}that the [[mind]] itself necessarily makes a constitutive contribution to its [[knowledge]], that this contribution is transcendental rather than psychological, that philosophy involves self-critical activity, that morality is rooted in human freedom, and that to act autonomously is to act according to rational moral principles{{spaced ndash}}have all had a lasting effect on subsequent philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>==Theory of perception==={{Main|Critique of Pure Reason}}Kant defines his theory of perception in his influential 1781 work the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', which has often been cited as the most significant volume of metaphysics and [[epistemology]] in modern philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>Kant maintains that our understanding of the external world had its foundations not merely in experience, but in both experience and ''a priori'' [[concept]]s, thus offering a '''non-empiricist critique of rationalist philosophy''', which is what he and others referred to as his &quot;[[Copernican Revolution (metaphor)|Copernican revolution]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;An analytic proposition is true by nature of the meaning of the words in the sentence — we require no further knowledge than a grasp of the language to understand this proposition</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, a synthetic statement is one that tells us something about the world</span>
				<span class='text'>The truth or falsehood of synthetic statements derives from something outside their linguistic content</span>
				<span class='text'>In this instance, weight is not a necessary [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] of the body; until we are told the heaviness of the body we do not know that it has weight</span>
				<span class='text'>In this case, experience of the body is required before its heaviness becomes clear</span>
				<span class='text'>Before Kant's first Critique, empiricists (cf</span>
				<span class='text'>[[David Hume|Hume]]) and rationalists (cf</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]) assumed that all synthetic statements required experience to be known</span>
				<span class='text'>ant, however, contests this: he claims that elementary mathematics, like arithmetic, is synthetic ''a priori'', in that its statements provide new knowledge, but knowledge that is not derived from experience</span>
				<span class='text'>This becomes part of his over-all argument for [[transcendental idealism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>That is, he argues that the possibility of experience depends on certain [[necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary conditions]] — which he calls ''a priori'' forms — and that these conditions structure and hold true of the world of experience</span>
				<span class='text'>In so doing, his main claims in the &quot;[[Critique of Pure Reason#I</span>
				<span class='text'>Transcendental Doctrine of Elements|Transcendental Aesthetic]]&quot; are that mathematic judgments are synthetic ''a priori'' and in addition, that [[Space]] and [[Time]] are not derived from experience but rather are its preconditions</span>
				<span class='text'>nce we have grasped the functions of basic arithmetic, we do not need any empirical experience to know that 100 + 100 = 200, and so it appears that arithmetic is analytic</span>
				<span class='text'>However, that it is analytic can be disproved by considering the calculation 5 + 7 = 12: there is nothing in the numbers 5 and 7 by which the number 12 can be inferred</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus &quot;5 + 7&quot; and &quot;the cube root of 1,728&quot; or &quot;12&quot; are not analytic because their reference is the same but their sense is not — the mathematical judgment &quot;5 + 7 = 12&quot; tells us something new about the world</span>
				<span class='text'>It is self-evident, and undeniably ''a priori'', but at the same time it is synthetic</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus Kant proved that a proposition can be synthetic and known a priori</span>
				<span class='text'>ant asserts that experience is based both on the perception of external objects and ''a priori'' knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The German word ''Anschauung'', which Kant used, literally means 'looking at' and generally means what in philosophy in English is called &quot;perception&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>However it sometimes is rendered as &quot;intuition&quot;: not, however, with the vernacular meaning of an indescribable or mystical experience or sixth sense, but rather with the meaning of the direct perception or grasping of sensory phenomena</span>
				<span class='text'>In this article, both terms, &quot;perception&quot; and &quot;intuition&quot; are used to stand for Kant's ''Anschauung''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The external world, he writes, provides those things that we sense</span>
				<span class='text'>But it is our mind that processes this information and gives it order, allowing us to comprehend it</span>
				<span class='text'>Our mind supplies the conditions of space and time to experience objects</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the &quot;transcendental unity of apperception&quot;, the concepts of the mind (Understanding) and the perceptions or intuitions that garner information from phenomena (Sensibility) are synthesized by comprehension</span>
				<span class='text'>Without the concepts, perceptions are nondescript; without the perceptions, concepts are meaningless — thus the famous statement, &quot;Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions (perceptions) without concepts are blind</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Kant also claims that an external environment is necessary for the establishment of the self</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Kant would want to argue that there is no empirical way of observing the self, we can see the logical necessity of the self when we observe that we can have different perceptions of the external environment over time</span>
				<span class='text'>By uniting all of these general representations into one global representation, we can see how a transcendental self emerges</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I am therefore conscious of the identical self in regard to the manifold of the representations that are given to me in an intuition because I call them all together my representations</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|Kant statue in [[Belo Horizonte]], Brazil]]Kant deemed it obvious that we have some objective knowledge of the world, such as, say, Newtonian physics</span>
				<span class='text'>But this knowledge relies on [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic]], ''a priori'' laws of nature, like causality and substance</span>
				<span class='text'>The problem, then, is how this is possible</span>
				<span class='text'>Kant's solution was to reason that the [[Subject (philosophy)#The subject in German idealism|subject]] must supply laws that make experience of objects possible, and that these laws are the synthetic, ''a priori'' laws of nature that we know apply to all objects before we experience them</span>
				<span class='text'>So, to deduce all these laws, Kant examined experience in general, dissecting in it what is supplied by the mind from what is supplied by the given intuitions</span>
				<span class='text'>What has just been explicated is commonly called a transcendental reduction</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Prolegomena&quot;&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Prolegomena to perhaps Any Future Metaphysics'', pages 35 to 43</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;To begin with, Kant's distinction between the ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' being [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] and particular knowledge, and the ''a priori'' being universal and necessary knowledge, must be kept in mind</span>
				<span class='text'>For if we merely connect two intuitions together in a perceiving subject, the knowledge is always subjective because it is derived ''a posteriori,'' when what is desired is for the knowledge to be objective, that is, for the two intuitions to refer to the object and hold good of it necessarily universally for anyone at anytime, not just the perceiving subject in its current condition</span>
				<span class='text'>What else is equivalent to objective knowledge besides the ''a priori,'' that is to say, universal and necessary knowledge? Nothing else, and hence before knowledge can be objective, it must be incorporated under an ''a priori'' category of ''the understanding''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Prolegomena&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>ebdeleuze</span>
				<span class='text'>om/php/texte</span>
				<span class='text'>hp?cle=66&amp;groupe=Kant&amp;langue=2 Deleuze on Kant], from where the definitions of ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' were obtained</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;For example, say a subject says, &quot;The sun shines on the stone; the stone grows warm,&quot; which is all he perceives in perception</span>
				<span class='text'>His judgment is contingent and holds no necessity</span>
				<span class='text'>But if he says, &quot;The sunshine causes the stone to warm,&quot; he subsumes the perception under the category of causality, which is not found in the perception, and necessarily synthesizes the concept sunshine with the concept heat, producing a necessarily universally true judgment</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Prolegomena&quot;/&gt;To explain the categories in more detail, they are the preconditions of the construction of objects in the mind</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, to even think of the sun and stone presupposes the category of subsistence, that is, substance</span>
				<span class='text'>For the categories synthesize the random data of the sensory manifold into intelligible objects</span>
				<span class='text'>This means that the categories are also the most abstract things one can say of any object whatsoever, and hence one can have an ''a priori'' cognition of the totality of all objects of experience if one can list all of them</span>
				<span class='text'>To do so, Kant formulates another transcendental deduction</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Prolegomena&quot;/&gt;Judgments are, for Kant, the preconditions of any thought</span>
				<span class='text'>Man thinks via judgments, so all possible judgments must be listed and the perceptions connected within them put aside, so as to make it possible to examine the moments when ''the understanding'' is engaged in constructing judgments</span>
				<span class='text'>For the categories are equivalent to these moments, in that they are concepts of intuitions in general, so far as they are determined by these moments universally and necessarily</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus by listing all the moments, one can deduce from them all of the categories</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Prolegomena&quot;/&gt;One may now ask: How many possible judgments are there? Kant believed that all the possible propositions within Aristotle's [[syllogism|syllogistic]] logic are equivalent to all possible judgments, and that all the logical operators within the propositions are equivalent to the moments of the understanding within judgments</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus he listed Aristotle's system in four groups of three: quantity (universal, particular, singular), quality (affirmative, negative, infinite), relation (categorical, hypothetical, disjunctive) and modality (problematic, assertoric, apodeictic)</span>
				<span class='text'>The parallelism with Kant's categories is obvious: quantity (unity, plurality, totality), quality (reality, negation, limitation), relation (substance, cause, community) and modality (possibility, existence, necessity)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Prolegomena&quot;/&gt;The fundamental building blocks of experience, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>objective knowledge, are now in place</span>
				<span class='text'>First there is the sensibility, which supplies the mind with intuitions, and then there is the understanding, which produces judgments of these intuitions and can subsume them under categories</span>
				<span class='text'>These categories lift the intuitions up out of the subject's current state of consciousness and place them within consciousness in general, producing universally necessary knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>For the categories are innate in any rational being, so any intuition thought within a category in one mind is necessarily subsumed and understood identically in any mind</span>
				<span class='text'>In other words, we filter what we see and hear</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Prolegomena&quot;/&gt;===Transcendental schema doctrine==={{See also|Schema (Kant)}}Kant ran into a problem with his theory that the mind plays a part in producing objective knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>Intuitions and categories are entirely disparate, so how can they interact? Kant's solution is the (transcendental) schema: a priori principles by which the transcendental imagination connects concepts with intuitions through time</span>
				<span class='text'>All the principles are temporally bound, for if a concept is purely a priori, as the categories are, then they must apply for all times</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence there are principles such as ''substance is that which endures through time'', and ''the cause must always be prior to the effect''</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Immanuel Kant]]Kant developed his moral philosophy in three works: ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]'' (1785),&lt;ref name= Beck1&gt;Kant, Immanuel</span>
				<span class='text'>''Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals''</span>
				<span class='text'>Trans</span>
				<span class='text'>Lewis White Beck</span>
				<span class='text'>Page numbers citing this work are Beck's marginal numbers that refer to the page numbers of the standard edition of ''Königliche Preussische Akademie der Wissenschaften''</span>
				<span class='text'>Berlin, 1902–38</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'' (1788), and ''[[Metaphysics of Morals]]'' (1797)</span>
				<span class='text'>n the ''Groundwork'', Kant's method involves trying to convert our everyday, obvious, rational&lt;ref&gt;The distinction between rational and philosophical knowledge is given in the Preface to the ''Groundwork'', 1785</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; knowledge of morality into philosophical knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'>The latter two works followed a method of using &quot;practical reason&quot;, which is based only on things about which reason can tell us, and not deriving any principles from experience, to reach conclusions which can be applied to the world of experience (in the second part of ''The Metaphysic of Morals'')</span>
				<span class='text'>ant is known for his theory that there is a single [[moral obligation]], which he called the &quot;[[Categorical Imperative]]&quot;, and is derived from the concept of [[duty]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Kant defines the demands of the moral law as &quot;categorical imperatives&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Categorical imperatives are principles that are intrinsically valid; they are good in and of themselves; they must be obeyed by everyone in all situations and circumstances, if our behavior is to observe the moral law</span>
				<span class='text'>The Categorical Imperative generates all other moral obligations, and they can be tested against it</span>
				<span class='text'>Kant also stated that the moral means and ends can be applied to the categorical imperative, that rational beings can pursue certain &quot;ends&quot; using the appropriate &quot;means&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Ends based on physical needs or wants can create merely [[hypothetical imperative]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>The categorical imperative can only be based on something that is an &quot;end in itself&quot;, that is, an end that is not a means to some other need, desire, or purpose</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Beck 421&quot;&gt;Kant, ''Foundations'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>421</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Kant believed that the moral law is a principle of [[reason]] itself, and is not based on contingent facts about the world, such as what would make us happy, but to act on the moral law which has no other motive than &quot;worthiness of being happy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;CPR A806 B834&quot;&gt;''Critique of Pure Reason'', A806/B834</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, he believed that moral obligation applies only to rational agents</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Beck 408&quot;&gt;Kant, ''Foundations'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>408</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Unlike a hypothetical imperative, a categorical imperative is an unconditional obligation; that is, it has the force of an obligation regardless of our will or desires&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck 420-1&quot;&gt;Kant, ''Foundations'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>420–1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In ''Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals'' (1785) Kant enumerated three formulations of the categorical imperative that he believed to be roughly equivalent</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Beck 436&quot;&gt;Kant, ''Foundations'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>436</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Kant believed that if an action is not done with the motive of duty, then it is without moral value</span>
				<span class='text'>He thought that every action should have pure intention behind it; otherwise it was meaningless</span>
				<span class='text'>The final result was not the most important aspect of an action, but how the person felt while carrying out the action was the time at which value was set to the result</span>
				<span class='text'>n ''Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals'', Kant also posited the &quot;counter-[[utilitarian]] idea that there is a difference between preferences and values, and that considerations of individual rights temper calculations of aggregate utility&quot;, a concept that is an axiom in economics:&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2003) ''Ecosystems and Well-being: A Framework for Assessment''</span>
				<span class='text'>Washington DC: Island Press, p</span>
				<span class='text'>142</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Everything has either a ''price'' or a ''dignity''</span>
				<span class='text'>Whatever has a price can be replaced by something else as its equivalent; on the other hand, whatever is above all price, and therefore admits of no equivalent, has a dignity</span>
				<span class='text'>But that which constitutes the condition under which alone something can be an end in itself does not have mere relative worth, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> price, but an intrinsic worth, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> a dignity</span>
				<span class='text'>(p</span>
				<span class='text'>53, italics in original)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;A phrase quoted by Kant, which is used to summarize the counter-utilitarian nature of his moral philosophy, is ''[[Fiat justitia, pereat mundus]]'', (&quot;Let justice be done, though the world perish&quot;), which he translates loosely as &quot;Let justice reign even if all the rascals in the world should perish from it&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>MacMillan, 1973</span>

				<span class='text'>400, 429</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The universalisability test has five steps:# Find the agent's maxim (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> an action paired with its motivation)</span>
				<span class='text'>Take for example the declaration &quot;I will lie for personal benefit&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Lying is the action; the motivation is to fulfill some sort of desire</span>
				<span class='text'>Paired together, they form the maxim</span>
				<span class='text'> Imagine a possible world in which everyone in a similar position to the real-world agent followed that maxim</span>
				<span class='text'>With no exception of one's self</span>
				<span class='text'>This is in order for you to hold people to the same principle required of yourself</span>
				<span class='text'> Decide whether any contradictions or irrationalities arise in the possible world as a result of following the maxim</span>
				<span class='text'> If a contradiction or irrationality arises, acting on that maxim is not allowed in the real world</span>
				<span class='text'> If there is no contradiction, then acting on that maxim is permissible, and is sometimes required</span>
				<span class='text'>For a modern parallel, see [[John Rawls]]' hypothetical situation, the [[original position]]</span>
				<span class='text'>====Second formulation====The second formulation (or Formula of the End in Itself) holds that &quot;the rational being, as by its nature an end and thus as an end in itself, must serve in every maxim as the condition restricting all merely relative and arbitrary ends&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Beck 436&quot; /&gt; The principle dictates that you &quot;[a]ct with reference to every rational being (whether yourself or another) so that it is an end in itself in your maxim&quot;, meaning that the rational being is &quot;the basis of all maxims of action&quot; and &quot;must be treated never as a mere means but as the supreme limiting condition in the use of all means, i</span>

				<span class='text'>437–8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Third formulation====The third formulation (Formula of Autonomy) is a synthesis of the first two and is the basis for the &quot;complete determination of all maxims&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>It says &quot;that all maxims which stem from autonomous legislation ought to harmonize with a possible realm of ends as with a realm of nature&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Beck 436&quot; /&gt; In principle, &quot;So act as if your maxims should serve at the same time as the universal law (of all rational beings)&quot;, meaning that we should so act that we may think of ourselves as &quot;a member in the universal realm of ends&quot;, [[legislating]] universal laws through our maxims (that is, a [[code of conduct]]), in a &quot;possible realm of ends&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>He sees all of these as efforts to make oneself pleasing to God in ways other than conscientious adherence to the principle of moral rightness in choosing one's actions</span>
				<span class='text'> The severity of Kant's criticisms on these matters, along with his rejection of the possibility of theoretical proofs for the existence of God and his philosophical re-interpretation of some basic Christian doctrines, allow interpretations that see Kant as thoroughly hostile to religion in general and Christianity in particular (e</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Kant distinguishes between the transcendental idea of freedom, which as a psychological concept is &quot;mainly empirical&quot; and refers to &quot;the question whether we must admit a power of spontaneously beginning a series of successive things or states&quot; as a real ground of necessity in regard to causality,&lt;ref name=&quot;CPR A448 B476&quot;&gt;Kant, ''Critique of Pure Reason'', A448/B476</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and the practical concept of freedom as the independence of our will from the &quot;coercion&quot; or &quot;necessitation through sensuous impulses&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Kant finds it a source of difficulty that the practical idea of freedom is founded on the transcendental idea of freedom,&lt;ref name = &quot;CPR A534 B562&quot;&gt;Kant, ''Critique of Pure Reason'', A534/B562</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; but for the sake of practical interests uses the practical meaning, taking &quot;no account of</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>Kant's categories of freedom apparently function primarily as conditions for the possibility for actions (i) to be free, (ii) to be understood as free and (iii) to be morally evaluated</span>
				<span class='text'>For Kant, although actions as theoretical objects are constituted by means of the theoretical categories, actions as practical objects (objects of practical use of reason, and which can be good or bad) are constituted by means of the categories of freedom</span>

				<span class='text'>Kant's contribution to [[aesthetics|aesthetic theory]] is developed in the ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' (1790) where he investigates the possibility and logical status of &quot;judgments of taste</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In the &quot;Critique of Aesthetic Judgment,&quot; the first major division of the ''Critique of Judgment'', Kant used the term &quot;aesthetic&quot; in a manner that, according to Kant scholar W</span>

				<span class='text'>Macmillan, 1973</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, in the ''Critique of Pure Reason'', to note essential differences between judgments of taste, moral judgments, and scientific judgments, Kant abandoned the term &quot;aesthetic&quot; as &quot;designating the critique of taste,&quot; noting that judgments of taste could never be &quot;directed&quot; by &quot;laws ''a priori''&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Kant was one of the first philosophers to develop and integrate aesthetic theory into a unified and comprehensive philosophical system, utilizing ideas that played an integral role throughout his philosophy</span>

				<span class='text'>Macmillan, 1973</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the chapter &quot;Analytic of the Beautiful&quot; of the ''Critique of Judgment'', Kant states that beauty is not a property of an artwork or natural phenomenon, but is instead a consciousness of the pleasure that attends the 'free play' of the imagination and the understanding</span>
				<span class='text'>Even though it appears that we are using reason to decide what is beautiful, the judgment is not a cognitive judgment,&lt;ref&gt;Kant's general discussions of the distinction between &quot;cognition&quot; and &quot;conscious of&quot; are also given in the ''Critique of Pure Reason'' (notably A320/B376), and section V and the conclusion of section VIII of his Introduction in ''Logic''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; &quot;and is consequently not logical, but aesthetical&quot; (§ 1)</span>
				<span class='text'>A pure judgement of taste is in fact subjective insofar as it refers to the emotional response of the subject and is based upon nothing but esteem for an object itself: it is a ''disinterested'' pleasure, and we feel that pure judgements of taste, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>judgements of beauty, lay claim to universal validity (§§20–22)</span>
				<span class='text'>It is important to note that this universal validity is not derived from a determinate concept of beauty but from ''common sense'' (§40)</span>
				<span class='text'>Kant also believed that a judgement of taste shares characteristics engaged in a moral judgement: both are disinterested, and we hold them to be universal</span>
				<span class='text'>In the chapter &quot;Analytic of the Sublime&quot; Kant identifies the sublime as an aesthetic quality that, like beauty, is subjective, but unlike beauty refers to an indeterminate relationship between the faculties of the imagination and of reason, and shares the character of moral judgments in the use of reason</span>
				<span class='text'>The feeling of the sublime, itself officially divided into two distinct modes (the mathematical and the dynamical sublime), describes two subjective moments, both of which concern the relationship of the faculty of the imagination to reason</span>
				<span class='text'>Some commentators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clewis |first=Robert |year= 2009 |title=The Kantian Sublime and the Revelation of Freedom |location= Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/us/knowledge/isbn/item2326741/?site_locale=en_US}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, argue that Kant's critical philosophy contains a third kind of the sublime, the moral sublime, which is the aesthetic response to the moral law or a representation thereof, and a development of the &quot;noble&quot; sublime in Kant's theory of 1764</span>
				<span class='text'>The mathematical sublime is situated in the failure of the imagination to comprehend natural objects that appear boundless and formless, or appear &quot;absolutely great&quot; (§ 23–25)</span>
				<span class='text'>This imaginative failure is then recuperated through the pleasure taken in reason's assertion of the concept of infinity</span>
				<span class='text'>In this move the faculty of reason proves itself superior to our fallible sensible self (§§ 25–26)</span>
				<span class='text'>In the dynamical sublime there is the sense of annihilation of the sensible self as the imagination tries to comprehend a vast might</span>
				<span class='text'>This power of nature threatens us but through the resistance of reason to such sensible annihilation, the subject feels a pleasure and a sense of the human moral vocation</span>
				<span class='text'>This appreciation of moral feeling through exposure to the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] helps to develop moral character</span>
				<span class='text'>ant had developed the distinction between an object of art as a material value subject to the conventions of society and the transcendental condition of the judgment of taste as a &quot;refined&quot; value in the propositions of his ''Idea of A Universal History'' (1784)</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;In more characteristically Kantian terms, it is doctrine of the state based upon the law ([[Rechtsstaat]]) and of eternal peace</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, in each of these formulations, both terms express the same idea: that of legal constitution or of 'peace through law'</span>
				<span class='text'> Taken simply by itself, Kant's political philosophy, being essentially a legal doctrine, rejects by definition the opposition between moral education and the play of passions as alternate foundations for social life</span>
				<span class='text'>The state is defined as the union of men under law</span>
				<span class='text'>The state rightly so called is constituted by laws which are necessary a priori because they flow from the very concept of law</span>

				<span class='text'>]During his own life, there was much critical attention paid to his thought</span>
				<span class='text'>He had an influence on [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold|Reinhold]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Schelling]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], and [[Novalis]] during the 1780s and 1790s</span>
				<span class='text'>The school of thinking known as [[German Idealism]] developed from his writings</span>
				<span class='text'>The German Idealists Fichte and Schelling, for example, tried to bring traditional &quot;metaphysically&quot; laden notions like &quot;the Absolute&quot;, &quot;God&quot;, and &quot;Being&quot; into the scope of Kant's critical thought</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;There is much debate in the recent scholarship about the extent to which Fichte and Schelling actually overstep the boundaries of Kant's critical philosophy, thus entering the realm of dogmatic or pre-Critical philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>Beiser's ''German Idealism'' discusses some of these issues</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In so doing, the German Idealists tried to reverse Kant's view that we cannot know what we cannot observe</span>
				<span class='text'>egel was one of Kant's first major critics</span>
				<span class='text'>In response to what he saw as Kant's abstract and formal account, Hegel brought about an ethic focused on the &quot;ethical life&quot; of the community</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; But Hegel's notion of &quot;ethical life&quot; is meant to subsume, rather than replace, [[Kantian ethics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>And Hegel can be seen as trying to defend Kant's idea of freedom as going beyond finite &quot;desires&quot;, by means of reason</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, in contrast to later critics like Nietzsche or Russell, Hegel shares some of Kant's most basic concerns</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Robert Pippin's ''Hegel's Idealism'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989) emphasizes the continuity of Hegel's concerns with Kant's</span>
				<span class='text'>Robert Wallace, ''Hegel's Philosophy of Reality, Freedom, and God'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005) explains how Hegel's ''Science of Logic'' defends Kant's idea of freedom as going beyond finite &quot;inclinations&quot;, contra skeptics such as David Hume</span>

				<span class='text'>He, like [[G</span>
				<span class='text'>E</span>
				<span class='text'>Schulze]], [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], and Fichte before him, was critical of Kant's theory of the thing in itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Things in themselves, they argued, are neither the cause of what we observe nor are they completely beyond our access</span>
				<span class='text'>Ever since the first ''Critique of Pure Reason'' philosophers have been critical of Kant's theory of the thing in itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Many have argued, if such a thing exists beyond experience then one cannot posit that it affects us causally, since that would entail stretching the category 'causality' beyond the realm of experience</span>
				<span class='text'>For a review of this problem and the relevant literature see ''The Thing in Itself and the Problem of Affection'' in the revised edition of Henry Allison's ''Kant's Transcendental Idealism''</span>
				<span class='text'>For Schopenhauer things in themselves do not exist outside the non-rational will</span>
				<span class='text'>The world, as Schopenhauer would have it, is the striving and largely unconscious will</span>
				<span class='text'>Michael Kelly, in the preface to his 1910 book ''Kant's Ethics and Schopenhauer's Criticism'', stated: &quot;Of Kant it may be said that what is good and true in his philosophy would have been buried with him, were it not for Schopenhauer</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;With the success and wide influence of Hegel's writings, Kant's influence began to wane, though there was in Germany a movement that hailed a return to Kant in the 1860s, beginning with the publication of ''Kant und die Epigonen'' in 1865 by [[Otto Liebmann]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His motto was &quot;Back to Kant&quot;, and a re-examination of his ideas began (See [[Neo-Kantianism]])</span>
				<span class='text'>During the turn of the 20th century there was an important revival of Kant's theoretical philosophy, known as the [[Marburg School]], represented in the work of [[Hermann Cohen]], [[Paul Natorp]], [[Ernst Cassirer]],&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Lewis White</span>

				<span class='text'>The mausoleum was constructed by the architect [[Friedrich Lahrs]] and was finished in 1924 in time for the bicentenary of Kant's birth</span>
				<span class='text'>Originally, Kant was buried inside the cathedral, but in 1880 his remains were moved outside and placed in a [[neo-Gothic]] chapel adjoining the northeast corner of the cathedral</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the years, the chapel became dilapidated before it was demolished to make way for the mausoleum, which was built on the same spot, where it is today</span>
				<span class='text'>he tomb and its mausoleum are among the few artifacts of German times preserved by the [[Soviets]] after they conquered and annexed the city</span>
				<span class='text'>Today, many newlyweds bring flowers to the mausoleum</span>
				<span class='text'>rtifacts previously owned by Kant, known as ''Kantiana'', were included in the [[Königsberg City Museum]]</span>

				<span class='text'> replica of the statue of Kant that stood in German times in front of the main [[University of Königsberg]] building was donated by a German entity in the early 1990s and placed in the same grounds</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the expulsion of [[Königsberg]]'s German population at the end of [[World War II]], the University of Königsberg where Kant taught was replaced by the Russian-language Kaliningrad State University, which took up the campus and surviving buildings of the historic German university</span>
				<span class='text'>In 2005, the university was renamed [[Immanuel Kant State University of Russia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The change of name was announced at a ceremony attended by President [[Vladimir Putin]] of Russia and Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] of Germany, and the university formed a Kant Society, dedicated to the study of [[Kantianism]]</span>
