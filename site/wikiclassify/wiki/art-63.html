				<span class='text'>''lokottara'') and perfected being who is unencumbered by the mundane world</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ''Mahāvastu'', over the course of many lives, Gautama is said to have developed supra-mundane abilities including: a painless birth conceived without intercourse; no need for sleep, food, medicine, or bathing, although engaging in such &quot;in conformity with the world&quot;; omniscience, and the ability to &quot;suppress karma&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'> These may reflect the different traditional views on [[Buddhist vegetarianism]] and the precepts for monks and nuns</span>
				<span class='text'>[Arthur Waley|Waley]] suggests that Theravadin's would take ''suukaramaddava'' (the contents of the Buddha's last meal), which can translate literally as ''pig-soft'', to mean &quot;soft flesh of a pig&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he also states that ''pig-soft'' could mean &quot;pig's soft-food&quot;, that is, after [[Karl Eugen Neumann|Neumann]], a soft food favoured by pigs, assumed to be a [[truffle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He argues (also after Neumann) that as &quot;(p)lant names tend to be local and dialectical&quot;, as there are several plants known to have ''suukara-'' (pig) as part of their names,&lt;ref group = note name= &quot;Wayley1932&quot;&gt;Waley notes: ''suukara-kanda'', &quot;pig-bulb&quot;; ''suukara-paadika'', &quot;pig's foot&quot; and  ''sukaresh</span>
				<span class='text'>a''  &quot;sought-out by pigs&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> He cites Neumann's suggestion that if a plant called &quot;sought-out by pigs&quot; exists then ''suukaramaddava'' can mean &quot;pig's delight&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and as Pali Buddhism developed in an area remote from the Buddha's death, ''suukaramaddava'' could easily have been a type of plant whose local name was unknown to those in Pali regions</span>
				<span class='text'>Specifically, local writers writing soon after the Buddha's death knew more about their flora than Theravadin commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] who lived hundreds of years and hundreds of kilometres remote in time and space from the events described</span>
				<span class='text'>Unaware that it may have been a local plant name and with no Theravadin prohibition against eating animal flesh, Theravadins would not have questioned the Buddha eating meat and interpreted the term accordingly</span>

				<span class='text'>They had none</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Buddhist scriptures, he then finally entered Parinirvana</span>
