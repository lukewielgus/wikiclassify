				<span class='text'>Although some of his stories were fanciful and others inaccurate, he states he was reporting only what was told to him and was often correct in his information</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite Herodotus' historical significance, little is known of his personal history</span>

				<span class='text'>The purpose is to prevent the traces of human events from being erased by time, and to preserve the fame of the important and remarkable achievements produced by both Greeks and non-Greeks; among the matters covered is, in particular, the cause of the hostilities between Greeks and non-Greeks</span>
				<span class='text'>Herodotus, ''The Histories''&lt;br&gt;Robin Waterfield translation (2008)}}His record of the achievements of others was an achievement in itself, though the extent of it has been debated</span>
				<span class='text'>His place in history and his significance may be understood according to the traditions within which he worked</span>
				<span class='text'>His work is the earliest Greek prose to have survived intact</span>
				<span class='text'>However, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], a literary critic of [[Principate|Augustan Rome]], listed seven predecessors of Herodotus, describing their works as simple, unadorned accounts of their own and other cities and people, Greek or foreign, including popular legends, sometimes melodramatic and naive, often charming‚Äîall traits that can be found in the work of Herodotus himself</span>

				<span class='text'>Burn, ''Herodotus: The Histories'', Penguin Classics, 1972, page 23, citing Dionysius ''On Thucydides''&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians regard the chronology as uncertain</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the ancient account, these predecessors included Dionysius of Miletus, Charon of Lampsacus, [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]], [[Xanthus of Lydia]] and, the best attested of them all, [[Hecataeus of Miletus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Of these only fragments of  Hecataeus's work survive (and the authenticity of these is debatable)&lt;ref&gt;A</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Burn, ''Herodotus: The Histories'', Penguin Classics, 1972, page 27&lt;/ref&gt; yet they allow us glimpses into the kind of tradition within which Herodotus wrote his own ''Histories'', as in the introduction to Hecataeus's work, ''Genealogies'':[[File:POxy v0017 n2099 a 01 hires</span>

				<span class='text'>Herodotus mentions Hecataeus in his ''Histories'', on one occasion mocking him for his naive genealogy and, on another occasion, quoting Athenian complaints against his handling of their national history</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Herodotus|en|2|143|shortref}}, {{Herodotus|en|6|137}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Herodotus borrowed much material from Hecataeus, as stated by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in a quote recorded by [[Eusebius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Preparation of the Gospel'', X,3&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it is possible that he copied descriptions of the [[crocodile]], [[hippopotamus]] and [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] from Hecataeus's 'Circumnavigation of the Known World' (''Periegesis''/''Periodos ges''), even mis-representing the source as 'Heliopolitans' (''Histories'' 2</span>

				<span class='text'>Burn, ''Herodotus: The Histories'', Penguin Classics, 1972, pages 22-3&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus claims to be better informed than his predecessors, relying on empirical observation to correct their excessive schematism</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, he argues for continental asymmetry as opposed to the older theory of a perfectly circular earth with Europe and Asia/Africa equal in size (''Hist</span>
				<span class='text'>' 4</span>
				<span class='text'>6 and 4</span>
				<span class='text'>2)</span>

				<span class='text'>Knox (eds), Cambridge University Press (1985), page 430&lt;/ref&gt;His debt to previous authors of prose 'histories' might be questionable but there is no doubt that he owed much to the example and inspiration of poets and story-tellers</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, Athenian tragic poets provided him with a world-view of a balance between conflicting forces, upset by the [[hubris]] of kings, and they provided his narrative with a model of episodic structure</span>
				<span class='text'>His familiarity with Athenian tragedy is demonstrated in a number of passages echoing [[Aeschylus]]'s ''[[Persae]]'', including the epigrammatic observation that the defeat of the Persian navy at [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]] caused the defeat of the land army (''Hist</span>
				<span class='text'>' 8</span>
				<span class='text'>8 ~ ''Persae'' 728)</span>
				<span class='text'>The debt may have been repaid by Sophocles because there appear to be echoes of ''The Histories'' in his plays, especially a passage in ''[[Antigone]]'' that resembles Herodotus's account of the death of Intaphernes (''Histories'' 3</span>

				<span class='text'>Burn,  ''Herodotus: The Histories'', Penguin Classics (1972), Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; go something like this: Herodotus was born at Halicarnassus around 484&amp;nbsp;BC</span>
				<span class='text'>There is no reason to disbelieve the Suda's information about his family, that it was influential and that he was the son of Lyxes and Dryo, and the brother of Theodorus, and that he was also related to [[Panyassis]], an epic poet of the time</span>
				<span class='text'>The town was within the Persian empire at that time and maybe the young Herodotus heard local eye-witness accounts of events within the empire and of Persian preparations for the invasion of Greece, including the movements of the local fleet under the command of [[Artemisia I of Caria|Artemisia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Inscriptions recently discovered at Halicarnassus indicate that her grandson Lygdamis negotiated with a local assembly to settle disputes over seized property, which is consistent with a tyrant under pressure, and his name is not mentioned later in the tribute list of the Athenian [[Delian League]], indicating that there might well have been a successful uprising against him sometime before 454&amp;nbsp;BC</span>
				<span class='text'>Herodotus reveals affection for the island of Samos (III,39‚Äì60) and this is an indication that he might have lived there in his youth</span>
				<span class='text'>So it is possible that his family was involved in an uprising against Lygdamis, leading to a period of exile on [[Samos]] and followed by some personal hand in the tyrant's eventual fall</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:herodotusstatue</span>
				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|The statue of Herodotus in his hometown of [[Halicarnassus]], modern [[Bodrum]], Turkey</span>
				<span class='text'>]As Herodotus himself reveals, [[Halicarnassus]], though a [[Dorians|Dorian city]], had ended its close relations with its Dorian neighbours after an unseemly quarrel (I,144), and it had helped pioneer Greek trade with Egypt (II,178)</span>
				<span class='text'>It was therefore an outward-looking, international-minded port within the Persian Empire and the historian's family could well have had contacts in countries under [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] rule, facilitating his travels and his researches</span>
				<span class='text'>His eye-witness accounts indicate that he traveled in Egypt probably sometime after 454&amp;nbsp;BC or possibly earlier in association with Athenians, after an Athenian fleet had assisted the uprising against [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian rule]] in 460‚Äì454&amp;nbsp;BC</span>
				<span class='text'>He probably traveled to [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] next and then down the [[Euphrates]] to [[Babylon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For some reason, probably associated with local politics, he subsequently found himself unpopular in Halicarnassus and, sometime around 447&amp;nbsp;BC, he migrated to [[Pericles|Periclean Athens]], a city for whose people and democratic institutions he declares his open admiration (V,78) and where he came to know not just leading citizens such as the [[Alcmaeonids]], a clan whose history features frequently in his writing, but also the local topography (VI,137; VIII,52‚Äì5)</span>

				<span class='text'>It is possible that he applied for Athenian citizenship‚Äîa rare honour after 451&amp;nbsp;BC, requiring two separate votes by a well-attended assembly‚Äîbut was unsuccessful</span>
				<span class='text'>In 443&amp;nbsp;BC, or shortly afterwards, he migrated to [[Thurium]] as part of an Athenian-sponsored colony</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Aristotle]] refers to a version of ''The Histories'' written by 'Herodotus of Thurium' and indeed some passages in the ''Histories'' have been interpreted as proof that he wrote about southern Italy from personal experience there  (IV,15,99; VI,127)</span>
				<span class='text'>Intimate knowledge of some events in the first years of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (VI,91; VII,133,233; IX,73) indicate that he might have returned to Athens, in which case it is possible that he died there during an outbreak of the plague</span>
				<span class='text'>Possibly he died in Macedonia instead after obtaining the patronage of the court there or else he died back in Thurium</span>
				<span class='text'>There is nothing in the ''Histories'' that can be dated with any certainty to later than 430, and it is generally assumed that he died not long afterwards, possibly before his sixtieth year</span>
				<span class='text'>erodotus wrote his 'Histories' in the [[Ionic Greek|Ionian]] dialect yet he was born in Halicarnassus, originally a [[Dorians|Dorian]] settlement</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the ''[[Suda]]'' (an 11th-century encyclopaedia of [[Byzantium]] which possibly took its information from traditional accounts), Herodotus learned the Ionian dialect as a boy living on the island of [[Samos]], whither he had fled with his family from the oppressions of Lygdamis, tyrant of Halicarnassus and grandson of [[Artemisia I of Caria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Suda also informs us that Herodotus later returned home to lead the revolt that eventually overthrew the tyrant</span>
				<span class='text'>However, thanks to recent discoveries of some inscriptions on Halicarnassus, dated to about that time, we now know that the [[Ionic Greek|Ionic dialect]] was used there even in official documents, so there was no need to assume like the Suda that he must have learned the dialect elsewhere</span>

				<span class='text'>|Gold dust and nuggets]]Herodotus provides much information about the nature of the world and the status of science during his lifetime, often engaging in private speculation</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, he reports that the annual flooding of the [[Nile]] was said to be the result of melting snows far to the south, and he comments that he cannot understand how there can be snow in Africa, the hottest part of the known world, offering an elaborate explanation based on the way that desert winds affect the passage of the Sun over this part of the world (2:18ff)</span>
				<span class='text'>He also passes on dismissive reports from [[Phoenicia]]n sailors that, while circumnavigating [[Africa]], they &quot;saw the sun on the right side while sailing westwards&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Owing to this brief mention, which is included almost as an afterthought, it has been argued that Africa was indeed circumnavigated by ancient seafarers, for this is precisely where the sun ought to have been</span>

				<span class='text'>|''Croesus Receiving Tribute from a Lydian Peasant'', by [[Claude Vignon]]]]After journeys to India and Pakistan, French ethnologist [[Michel Peissel]] claimed to have discovered an animal species that may illuminate one of the most bizarre passages in Herodotus's Histories</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Peissel Ants&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Ants' Gold: The Discovery of the Greek El Dorado in the Himalayas | publisher=Collins | author=Peissel, Michel | year=1984 | isbn=978-0-00-272514-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Book 3, passages 102 to 105, Herodotus reports that a species of fox-sized, furry &quot;[[ants]]&quot; lives in one of the far eastern, Indian provinces of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This region, he reports, is a sandy desert, and the sand there contains a wealth of fine gold dust</span>
				<span class='text'>These giant ants, according to Herodotus, would often unearth the gold dust when digging their mounds and tunnels, and the people living in this province would then collect the precious dust</span>
				<span class='text'>Peissel reports that in an isolated region of northern Pakistan, on the [[Deosai National Park|Deosai Plateau]] in [[Gilgit‚ÄìBaltistan]] province, there is a species of [[marmot]] - the [[Himalayan marmot]], a type of burrowing [[squirrel]] - that may have been what Herodotus called giant ants</span>
				<span class='text'>Much like the province that Herodotus describes, the ground of the Deosai Plateau is rich in gold dust</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Peissel, he interviewed the [[Brokpa|Minaro]] tribal people who live in the Deosai Plateau, and they have confirmed that they have, for generations, been collecting the gold dust that the marmots bring to the surface when they are digging their underground burrows</span>
				<span class='text'>Later authors like [[Pliny the Elder]] mentioned this story in the [[gold mining]] section of his ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>|The [[Himalayan marmot]]]] Peissel offers the theory that Herodotus may have confused the old Persian word for &quot;marmot&quot; with the word for &quot;mountain ant&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Research suggests that Herodotus probably did not know any Persian (or any other language except his native Greek) and was forced to rely on a many local translators when travelling in the vast multilingual Persian Empire</span>

				<span class='text'>ome &quot;calumnious fictions&quot; were written about Herodotus in a work titled ''[[On the Malice of Herodotus]]'', by [[Plutarch]], a [[Chaeronea]]n by birth, (or it might have been a [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], in this case &quot;a great collector of slanders&quot;), including the allegation that the historian was prejudiced against Thebes because the authorities there had denied him permission to set up a school</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Marcellinus, ''Life of Thucydides''&lt;/ref&gt; In fact Herodotus was in the habit of seeking out information from empowered sources within communities, such as aristocrats and priests, and this also occurred at an international level, with [[Pericles|Periclean Athens]] becoming his principal source of information about events in Greece</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, his reports about Greek events are often coloured by Athenian bias against rival states‚Äî[[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] and Corinth in particular</span>

				<span class='text'>n Book One, passages 23 and 24, Herodotus relates the story of [[Arion]], the renowned harp player, &quot;second to no man living at that time,&quot; who was saved by a dolphin</span>
				<span class='text'>Herodotus prefaces the story by noting that &quot;a very wonderful thing is said to have happened,&quot; and alleges its veracity by adding that the &quot;Corinthians and the Lesbians agree in their account of the matter</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Having become very rich while at the court of Periander, Arion conceived a desire to sail to Italy and Sicily</span>
				<span class='text'>He hired a vessel crewed by Corinthians, whom he felt he could trust, but the sailors plotted to throw him overboard and seize his wealth</span>
