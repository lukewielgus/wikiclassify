				<span class='text'>The group's original lineup consisted of brothers [[Brian Wilson|Brian]], [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]], and [[Carl Wilson]], their cousin [[Mike Love]], and their friend [[Al Jardine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Emerging at the vanguard of the &quot;[[California Sound]]&quot;, the band's early [[surf music|surf songs]] gained international popularity for distinct [[vocal harmony|vocal harmonies]] and lyrics that evoked a [[southern California]] [[youth culture]] of [[surfing]], cars, and romance</span>
				<span class='text'>Influenced by [[jazz]]-based [[vocal music|vocal group]]s, 1950s [[rock and roll]], and [[doo-wop]], Brian led the band in devising novel approaches to [[record producer|music production]] and [[arrangement|arranging]], experimenting with several [[musical genre|genres]] ranging from [[pop ballad]]s to [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] and [[baroque pop|baroque]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While initially managed by the Wilsons' father [[Murry Wilson|Murry]], [[Musicianship of Brian Wilson|Brian's creative ambitions and sophisticated songwriting abilities]] dominated the group's musical direction</span>
				<span class='text'>he ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album and &quot;[[Good Vibrations]]&quot; single, both released in 1966, featured an intricate and multi-layered sound that established the group as symbols of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|nascent counterculture era]], vaunting them to the top level of rock innovators</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the dissolution of ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'', Brian gradually ceded control to the rest of the band, reducing his input because of [[mental health]] and [[substance abuse]] issues</span>
				<span class='text'>Though the more democratic incarnation of the Beach Boys recorded a string of albums in various music styles that garnered international critical success, the group struggled to reclaim their commercial momentum in America</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the 1980s, much-publicized legal wrangling over royalties, [[Love v</span>

				<span class='text'>After Carl's death, many live configurations of the band fronted by Mike Love and [[Bruce Johnston]] continued to tour into the 2000s while other members pursued solo projects</span>

				<span class='text'>They combined, as [[Jim Miller (musician)|Jim Miller]] has put it, &quot;the instrumental sleekness of [[the Ventures]], the lyric sophistication of Chuck Berry, and the vocal expertise of some weird cross between [[the Lettermen]] and [[Frankie Lymon]] and [[the Teenagers]]&quot; with lyrics whos images, idioms, and concerns were drawn from the rarefied world of the middle-class white male southern California teenager</span>
				<span class='text'>… [But] it was the profound vocal virtuosity of the group, coupled with the obsessional drive and compositional ambitions of their leader, Brian Wilson, that promised their survival after the eventual breaking of fad fever</span>
				<span class='text'>… Comparison to other vocally oriented rock groups, such as [[the Association]], shows the Beach Boys' technique to be far superior, almost embarrassingly so</span>
				<span class='text'>They were so confident of their ability, and of Brian's skill as a producer to enhance it, that they were unafraid of doing sophisticated, [[a cappella]] glee-club arrangements containing multiple [[suspension (music)|suspension]]s, passing [[musical form|formations]], complex chords, and both [[chromatic]] and [[enharmonic]] [[modulation (music)|modulations]]</span>

				<span class='text'>{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=35}} Miller observed, &quot;On straight rockers they sang tight harmonies behind Love's lead  … on ballads, Brian played his [[falsetto]] off against lush, [[jazz]]-tinged voicings, often using (for rock) unorthodox harmonic structures</span>
