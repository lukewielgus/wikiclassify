				<span class='text'>vg}}'''Hernando de Soto''' (c</span>
				<span class='text'>1500 ‚Äì May 21, 1542) was a Spanish explorer and ''[[conquistador]]'' who led the first European expedition deep into the territory of the modern-day United States (Florida, Georgia, Alabama and most likely Arkansas), and the first documented European to have crossed the [[Mississippi River]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Morison1974/&gt;A vast undertaking, de Soto's North American expedition ranged throughout the [[southeastern United States]] searching for gold, and a passage to [[China]]</span>
				<span class='text'>De Soto died in 1542 on the banks of the Mississippi River in what is now Guachoya, Arkansas or Ferriday, Louisiana</span>
				<span class='text'>ernando de Soto was born to parents who were ''[[Hidalgo (nobility)|hidalgos]]'' of modest means in [[Extremadura]], a region of poverty and hardship from which many young people looked for ways to seek their fortune elsewhere</span>
				<span class='text'>He was born in Jerez de los Caballeros, in the current province of Badajoz</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Leon/&gt;{{rp|135}}  However, three towns‚Äî[[Badajoz]], [[Barcarrota]] and [[Jerez de los Caballeros]]‚Äîclaim to be his birthplace</span>

				<span class='text'>Page 39</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The age of the Conquerors came on the heels of the Spanish [[Reconquista|reconquest]] of the [[Iberian peninsula]] from Islamic forces</span>
				<span class='text'>Spain and [[Portugal]] were filled with young men seeking a chance for military fame after the [[Moors]] were defeated</span>
				<span class='text'>With discovery of new lands to the west (which they thought at the time to be [[East Asia]]), they were attracted to whispers of glory and wealth</span>
				<span class='text'>e Soto sailed to the [[New World]] with the first Governor of [[Panama]], [[Pedrarias D√°vila]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1520 he participated in [[Gaspar de Espinosa]]'s expedition to [[Veragua]], and in 1524, he participated in the conquest of Nicaragua under [[Francisco Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba (founder of Nicaragua)|Francisco Hernandez de Cordoba]]</span>
				<span class='text'>There he acquired an [[encomienda]] and a public office in [[Leon, Nicaragua]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Leon/&gt;{{rp|135}}Brave leadership, unwavering loyalty, and ruthless schemes for the extortion of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native villages]] for their captured chiefs became de Soto's hallmarks during the [[History of Panama|Conquest of Central America]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He gained fame as an excellent horseman, fighter, and tactician</span>
				<span class='text'>uring that time, de Soto was influenced by the achievements of [[Juan Ponce de Le√≥n]], the first European to reach [[Florida]]; [[Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa]], the first European to reach the [[Pacific Ocean]] coast of the Americas (he called it the &quot;South Sea&quot; on the south coast of Panama), and [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who first sailed that ocean to [[East Asia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Conquest of Peru==In 1530, de Soto became a ''[[regidor]]'' of [[Le√≥n, Nicaragua]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He led an expedition up the coast of the [[Yucat√°n Peninsula]] searching for a passage between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to enable trade with the Orient, the richest market in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>Failing that, and without means to explore further, de Soto, upon [[Pedro Arias D√°vila]]'s death, left his estates in [[Nicaragua]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bringing his own men on ships which he hired, de Soto joined [[Francisco Pizarro]] at his first base of [[Tumbes (city)|Tumbes]] shortly before departure for the interior of present-day [[Peru]]</span>

				<span class='text'>During this captivity, de Soto became friendly with Atahualpa and taught him to play chess</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time the ransom had been completed, the Spanish became alarmed by rumors of an Incan army advancing on Cajamarca</span>

				<span class='text'>The Incan army withdrew during the night</span>
				<span class='text'>The Spanish plundered Cuzco, where they found much gold and silver</span>

				<span class='text'>They had lost nearly half their men, most of the horses had been killed, the soldiers wore animal skins for clothing, and many were injured and in poor health</span>
				<span class='text'>The leaders came to a consensus (although not total) to abort the expedition and try to find a way home, either down the Mississippi River, or overland across Texas to the Spanish colony of Mexico City</span>

				<span class='text'>Eventually they reached a region in present-day Texas that was dry</span>
				<span class='text'>The native populations had thinned out to subsistence hunter-gatherers</span>
				<span class='text'>There were no villages for the soldiers to raid for food and the army was too large to live off the land</span>
				<span class='text'>They were forced to backtrack to the more developed agricultural regions along the Mississippi</span>
				<span class='text'>They began building seven ''bergant√≠nes'', or [[brigantine]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;TexBook&quot;/&gt; They melted down all the iron, including horse tackle and slave shackles, to make nails for the boats</span>
				<span class='text'>Winter came and went, and the spring floods delayed them another two months, but by July they set off down the Mississippi for the coast</span>
				<span class='text'>aking about two weeks to make the journey, the expedition encountered hostile tribes along the whole course</span>
				<span class='text'>Natives followed the boats in canoes, shooting arrows at the soldiers for days on end as they drifted through their territory</span>
				<span class='text'>The Spanish had no effective offensive weapons on the water, as their crossbows had long ceased working</span>
				<span class='text'>They relied on armor and sleeping mats to block the arrows</span>
				<span class='text'>About 11 Spaniards were killed along this stretch and many more wounded</span>
				<span class='text'>n reaching the mouth of the Mississippi, they stayed close to the Gulf shore heading south and west</span>
