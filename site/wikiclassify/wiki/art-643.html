				<span class='text'>That year, John Wilkes returned to England, stood as a candidate in the [[British general election, 1768|general election]], and came top of the poll in the [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex constituency]]</span>

				<span class='text'>277&lt;/ref&gt; but his piety was not shared by his brothers</span>
				<span class='text'>George was appalled by what he saw as their loose morals</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1770, his brother [[Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn]], was exposed as an adulterer, and the following year Cumberland married a young widow, [[Anne, Duchess of Cumberland and Strathearn|Anne Horton]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The King considered her inappropriate as a royal bride: she was from a lower social class and German law barred any children of the couple from the Hanoverian succession</span>
				<span class='text'>George insisted on a new law that essentially forbade members of the Royal Family from legally marrying without the consent of the Sovereign</span>
				<span class='text'>The subsequent bill was unpopular in Parliament, including among George's own ministers, but passed as the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly afterward, another of George's brothers, [[Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh]], revealed he had been secretly married to [[Maria, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh|Maria, Countess Waldegrave]], the illegitimate daughter of Sir [[Edward Walpole]]</span>

				<span class='text'>To assuage American opinion most of the custom duties were withdrawn, except for the tea duty, which in George's words was &quot;one tax to keep up the right [to levy taxes]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>141&lt;/ref&gt; In 1773, the tea ships moored in [[Boston Harbor]] were boarded by colonists and the tea thrown overboard, an event that became known as the [[Boston Tea Party]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, p</span>
				<span class='text'>143&lt;/ref&gt; With the clear support of Parliament, Lord North introduced measures, which were called the [[Intolerable Acts]] by the colonists: the [[Port of Boston]] was shut down and the [[Explanatory charter|charter]] of [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] was [[Massachusetts Government Act|altered]] so that the upper house of the legislature was appointed by [[the Crown]] instead of elected by the lower house</span>

				<span class='text'>Creating self-governing provinces, they circumvented the British ruling apparatus in each colony by 1774</span>

				<span class='text'>eorge III is often accused of obstinately trying to keep Great Britain at war with the revolutionaries in America, despite the opinions of his own ministers</span>
				<span class='text'>In the words of the Victorian author [[Sir George Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet|George Trevelyan]], the King was determined &quot;never to acknowledge the independence of the Americans, and to punish their contumacy by the indefinite prolongation of a war which promised to be eternal</span>

				<span class='text'>180–182, 192, 223&lt;/ref&gt; With the setbacks in America, Prime Minister [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] asked to transfer power to [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Lord Chatham]], whom he thought more capable, but George refused to do so; he suggested instead that Chatham serve as a subordinate minister in Lord North's administration, but Chatham refused to cooperate</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hibbert, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>156–157&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1778, [[Early modern France|France]] (Britain's chief rival) signed a [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|treaty of alliance]] with the United States and the conflict escalated</span>
				<span class='text'>The United States and France were soon joined by [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spain]] and the [[Dutch Republic]], while Britain had no major allies of its own</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford|Lord Gower]] and [[Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath|Lord Weymouth]] both resigned from the government</span>

				<span class='text'>Ayling, p</span>

				<span class='text'>He was further dismayed when the government introduced the India Bill, which proposed to reform the government of India by transferring political power from the [[East India Company]] to Parliamentary commissioners</span>

				<span class='text'>The bill was rejected by the Lords; three days later, the Portland ministry was dismissed, and [[William Pitt the Younger]] was appointed Prime Minister, with Temple as his Secretary of State</span>
				<span class='text'>On 17 December 1783, Parliament voted in favour of a motion condemning the influence of the monarch in parliamentary voting as a &quot;high crime&quot; and Temple was forced to resign</span>

				<span class='text'>George used the opportunity to drop the title &quot;king of France&quot;, which [[British claims to the French throne|English and British Sovereigns had maintained]] since the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Addington opposed emancipation, instituted annual accounts, abolished income tax and began a programme of disarmament</span>

				<span class='text'>George's review of 27,000 volunteers in [[Hyde Park, London]], on 26 and 28 October 1803 and at the height of the invasion scare, attracted an estimated 500,000 spectators on each day</span>

				<span class='text'>This [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]], however, met the same fate as the First and Second Coalitions, collapsing in 1805</span>
				<span class='text'>The setbacks in Europe took a toll on Pitt's health and he died in 1806, reopening the question of who should serve in the ministry</span>
				<span class='text'>Lord Grenville became Prime Minister, and his &quot;[[Ministry of All the Talents]]&quot; included Fox</span>
				<span class='text'>The King was conciliatory towards Fox, after being forced to capitulate over his appointment</span>
				<span class='text'>After Fox's death in September 1806, the King and ministry were in open conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>To boost recruitment, the ministry proposed a measure in February 1807 whereby Roman Catholics would be allowed to serve in all ranks of the Armed Forces</span>
				<span class='text'>George instructed them not only to drop the measure, but also to agree never to set up such a measure again</span>
				<span class='text'>The ministers agreed to drop the measure then pending, but refused to bind themselves in the future</span>

				<span class='text'>Parliament was dissolved, and the [[United Kingdom general election, 1807|subsequent election]] gave the ministry a strong majority in the House of Commons</span>
				<span class='text'>George III made no further major political decisions during his reign; the replacement of the Duke of Portland by Perceval in 1809 was of little actual significance</span>

				<span class='text'>To the right, George, Prince of Wales, is depicted dressed in rags</span>
				<span class='text'>]George III lived for 81 years and 239 days and reigned for 59 years and 96 days: both his life and his reign were longer than those of any of his predecessors</span>
				<span class='text'>Only [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]] and [[Elizabeth II]] [[List of British monarchs by longevity|have since lived]] and [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign|reigned longer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>eorge III was dubbed &quot;Farmer George&quot; by satirists, at first to mock his interest in mundane matters rather than politics, but later to contrast his homely thrift with his son's grandiosity and to portray him as a man of the people</span>

				<span class='text'>92–93, 267–273, 302–305, 317&lt;/ref&gt; Under George III, the [[British Agricultural Revolution]] reached its peak and great advances were made in fields such as science and industry</span>
				<span class='text'>There was unprecedented growth in the rural population, which in turn provided much of the workforce for the concurrent [[Industrial Revolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>10–11&lt;/ref&gt; George's collection of mathematical and scientific instruments is now housed in the [[Science Museum, London]]; he funded the construction and maintenance of [[William Herschel]]'s [[40-foot telescope]], which was the biggest ever built at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p</span>
				<span class='text'>204&lt;/ref&gt; Herschel discovered the planet [[Uranus]], which he at first named ''Georgium Sidus'' (George's Star) after the King, in 1781</span>
				<span class='text'>eorge III hoped that &quot;the tongue of malice may not paint my intentions in those colours she admires, nor the sycophant extoll me beyond what I deserve&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, p</span>
				<span class='text'>90&lt;/ref&gt; but in the popular mind George III has been both demonised and praised</span>
				<span class='text'>While very popular at the start of his reign, by the mid-1770s George had lost the loyalty of revolutionary American colonists,&lt;ref&gt;Carretta, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>99–101, 123–126&lt;/ref&gt; though it has been estimated that as many as half of the colonists remained loyal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ayling, p</span>
				<span class='text'>247&lt;/ref&gt; The grievances in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] were presented as &quot;repeated injuries and usurpations&quot; that he had committed to establish an &quot;absolute Tyranny&quot; over the colonies</span>
				<span class='text'>The Declaration's wording has contributed to the American public's perception of George as a tyrant</span>
				<span class='text'>Contemporary accounts of George III's life fall into two camps: one demonstrating &quot;attitudes dominant in the latter part of the reign, when the King had become a revered symbol of national resistance to French ideas and French power&quot;, while the other &quot;derived their views of the King from the bitter partisan strife of the first two decades of the reign, and they expressed in their works the views of the opposition&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reitan, p</span>
				<span class='text'>viii&lt;/ref&gt;Building on the latter of these two assessments, British historians of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as [[Sir George Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet|Trevelyan]] and [[Erskine May, 1st Baron Farnborough|Erskine May]], promoted hostile interpretations of George III's life</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in the mid-twentieth century the work of [[Lewis Bernstein Namier|Lewis Namier]], who thought George was &quot;much maligned&quot;, kick-started a re-evaluation of the man and his reign</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reitan, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>xii–xiii&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars of the later twentieth century, such as [[Herbert Butterfield|Butterfield]] and Pares, and Macalpine and Hunter,&lt;ref&gt;Macalpine, Ida; Hunter, Richard A</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; are inclined to treat George sympathetically, seeing him as a victim of circumstance and illness</span>
				<span class='text'>Butterfield rejected the arguments of his Victorian predecessors with withering disdain: &quot;Erskine May must be a good example of the way in which an historian may fall into error through an excess of brilliance</span>
				<span class='text'>His capacity for synthesis, and his ability to dovetail the various parts of the evidence&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>carried him into a more profound and complicated elaboration of error than some of his more pedestrian predecessors&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he inserted a doctrinal element into his history which, granted his original aberrations, was calculated to project the lines of his error, carrying his work still further from centrality or truth</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield, p</span>
				<span class='text'>152&lt;/ref&gt; In pursuing war with the American colonists, George III believed he was defending the right of an elected Parliament to levy taxes, rather than seeking to expand his own power or prerogatives</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Brooke, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>175–176&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of modern scholars, during the long reign of George III the monarchy continued to lose its political power, and grew as the embodiment of national morality</span>
