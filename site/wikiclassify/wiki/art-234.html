				<span class='text'>group=lower-alpha}} (August 1, 1819&amp;nbsp;– September 28, 1891) was an American [[novelist]], short story writer, and poet from the [[American Renaissance (literature)|American Renaissance]] period</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of his writings were published between 1846 and 1857</span>
				<span class='text'>Best known for his sea adventure ''[[Typee]]'' (1846) and his whaling novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (1851), he was almost forgotten during the last thirty years of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Melville's writing draws on his experience at sea as a common sailor, exploration of literature and philosophy, and engagement in the contradictions of American society in a period of rapid change</span>
				<span class='text'>The main characteristic of his style is probably pervasive allusion, reflecting his written sources</span>
				<span class='text'>Melville's way of adapting what he read for his own new purposes, scholar [[Stanley Thomas Williams|Stanley T</span>
				<span class='text'>Williams]] wrote, &quot;was a transforming power comparable to Shakespeare's&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Williams (1956), 231&lt;/ref&gt;Born in [[New York City]] as the third child of a merchant in French dry-goods, Melville ended his formal education abruptly after his father died in 1832, shortly after bankruptcy left the family in financial straits</span>
				<span class='text'>Melville briefly became a schoolteacher before he took to sea in 1839</span>
				<span class='text'>This voyage to Liverpool as a common sailor on a merchant ship became the basis for his fourth book, ''[[Redburn]]'' (1849)</span>
				<span class='text'>In late December 1840 he signed up aboard the ''Acushnet'' for his first whaling voyage, but jumped ship eighteen months later in the [[Marquesas Islands]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His first book, ''Typee'' (1846), a fictionalized account of his life among the natives there, became such a success that he worked up a sequel, ''[[Omoo]]'' (1847)</span>
				<span class='text'>The same year Melville married Elizabeth Knapp Shaw; their four children were born between 1849 and 1855</span>
				<span class='text'>n August 1850, Melville moved his family to a farm near [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]], where he established a profound but short-lived friendship with [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>''Moby-Dick'' was published in 1851 to mixed reviews, but proved a commercial failure</span>
				<span class='text'>Less than a year later, Melville's career as a popular author effectively ended with the cool reception of ''[[Pierre: or, The Ambiguities|Pierre]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The next years he turned to writing short fiction for magazines, such as &quot;[[Bartleby, the Scrivener]]&quot; and &quot;[[Benito Cereno]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; After the serialized novel ''[[Israel Potter]]'' was published as a book in 1855, the short stories were collected in 1856 as ''[[The Piazza Tales]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1857, Melville voyaged to England and the Near East; twenty years later, he worked his experience in Egypt and Palestine into an epic poem, ''[[Clarel: A Poem and Pilgrimage in the Holy Land]]'' (1876)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1857 he published ''[[The Confidence-Man]],'' his last prose work during his lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'>Having secured a position as Customs Inspector, he moved to New York</span>
				<span class='text'>He turned to poetry, the first example of which is his poetic reflection on the moral questions of the Civil War, ''[[Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War]]'' (1866)</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1867 his oldest child, Malcolm, died at home from a self-inflicted gunshot</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1886 Melville retired as Customs Inspector and privately published two volumes of poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>During the last years of his life, he returned to prose again and worked on ''[[Billy Budd, Sailor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' Left unfinished at his death, it was eventually published in 1924; it was adapted as a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage play and as an English opera in 1951, and a decade later as a film</span>
				<span class='text'>Melville's death in 1891 from cardiovascular disease subdued the reviving interest in him</span>
				<span class='text'>The centennial in 1919 of his birth was near the starting point of the &quot;Melville Revival,&quot; as scholars returned to his work and life, and Melville's writings have been appreciated as world classics</span>

				<span class='text'>His siblings, who played important roles in his career as well as his emotional life, were Gansevoort (1815–1846), Helen Maria (1817–1888), Augusta (1821–1876), Allan (1823–1872), Catherine (1825–1905), Frances Priscilla (1827–1885), and [[Thomas Melville|Thomas]] (1830–1884), who eventually became a governor of [[Sailors Snug Harbor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Part of a well-established and colorful [[Boston]] family, Melville's father, Allan, spent a good deal of time out of New York and in Europe as a commission merchant and an importer of French dry goods</span>
				<span class='text'>oth Melville's grandfathers were heroes of the Revolutionary War</span>
				<span class='text'>Major [[Thomas Melvill (American patriot)|Thomas Melvill]] (1751–1832) had taken part in the [[Boston Tea Party]],&lt;ref&gt;Delbanco (2005), 19&lt;/ref&gt; and his maternal grandfather, General [[Peter Gansevoort]] (1749–1812), was famous for having commanded the defense of [[Siege of Fort Stanwix|Fort Stanwix]] in New York in 1777</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Delbanco (2005), 17&lt;/ref&gt; Melville found satisfaction in his &quot;double revolutionary descent&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 12&lt;/ref&gt; Major Melvill sent his son Allan not to college but to France at the turn of the nineteenth century, where he spent two years in [[Paris]] and learned to speak and write French fluently</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 7&lt;/ref&gt; He subscribed to his own father's Unitarianism</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1814 Allan married Maria Gansevoort Melvill, who was committed to the Dutch Reformed version of the Calvinist creed that had ruled in her family</span>
				<span class='text'>The severe Protestantism of the Gansevoort's tradition ensured that she knew her Bible well, in English as well as Dutch,{{refn|This would have been the ''Statenvertaling'' of 1637, the Dutch equivalent of the King James Bible</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Melville's father, Allan Melvill (1782–1832), portrait from 1810 by [[John Rubens Smith]], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York</span>
				<span class='text'>In his novel ''[[Pierre: or, The Ambiguities|Pierre]]'' (1852), Melville fictionalized this portrait as the portrait of Pierre's father</span>
				<span class='text'>]Almost three weeks after his birth, on August 19, Herman Melville was baptized at home by a minister of the South Reformed Dutch Church</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 24&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1820s Melville lived a privileged, opulent life, in a household with three or more servants at a time</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 22&lt;/ref&gt; Once in every four years the family moved to more spacious and prestigious quarters, all the way to Broadway in 1828</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Parker 1996, 39&quot;&gt;Parker (1996), 39&lt;/ref&gt; Allan Melvill lived beyond his means and on large sums he borrowed from both his father and his wife's widowed mother</span>
				<span class='text'>His wife's opinion of his financial conduct is unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>Biographer [[Hershel Parker]] suggests Maria &quot;thought her mother's money was infinite and that she was entitled to much of her portion now, while she had small children</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Parker 1996, 39&quot;/&gt; How well, biographer Delbanco adds, the parents managed to hide the truth from their children is &quot;impossible to know</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Delbanco 2005, 23&quot;&gt;Delbanco (2005), 23&lt;/ref&gt; In 1830 Maria's family finally lost patience and their support came to a halt, at which point Allan's total debt to both families exceeded $20,000</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 52&lt;/ref&gt;Melville's education began when he was five years old, around the time the Melvills moved to a newly built house at 33 Bleecker Street</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 27&lt;/ref&gt; In 1826, the same year that Melville contracted [[scarlet fever]], Allan Melvill, who sent both Gansevoort and Herman to the New York Male High School, described Melville in a letter to Peter Gansevoort Jr</span>
				<span class='text'> as &quot;very backwards in speech &amp; somewhat slow in comprehension&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cited in Sealts (1988), 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 35 and 38&lt;/ref&gt; His older brother Gansevoort appeared to be the brightest of the children, but soon Melville's development increased its pace</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;You will be as much surprised as myself to know,&quot; Allan wrote Peter Gansevoort Jr</span>
				<span class='text'> &quot;that Herman proved the best Speaker in the introductory Department, at the examination of the High School, he has made rapid progress during the 2 last quarters</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sealts 1988, 17&quot;&gt;Sealts (1988), 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; In 1829 both Gansevoort and Herman were transferred to [[Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory School]], with Herman enrolling in the English Department on 28 September</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Sealts 1988, 17&quot;/&gt; &quot;Herman I think is making more progress than formerly,&quot; Allan wrote in May 1830 to Major Melvill, &quot;&amp; without being a bright Scholar, he maintains a respectable standing, &amp; would proceed further, if he could only be induced to study more – being a most amiable &amp; innocent child, I cannot find it in my heart to coerce him</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Parker (1996), 48&lt;/ref&gt;Emotionally unstable and behind with paying the rent for the house on Broadway, Allan tried to recover from his setbacks by moving his family to [[Albany, New York|Albany]] in 1830 and going into the fur business</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sullivan 117&lt;/ref&gt; In Albany, Melville attended the [[The Albany Academy|Albany Academy]] from October 1830 to October 1831, where he took the standard preparatory course, studying reading and spelling; penmanship; arithmetic; English grammar; geography; natural history; universal, Greek, Roman and English history; classical biography; and Jewish antiquities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=academy&gt;Titus (1980), 4–10&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown why he left the Academy in October 1831; Parker suggests that by then &quot;even the tiny tuition fee seemed too much to pay</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Parker 1996, 56&quot;&gt;Parker (1996), 56&lt;/ref&gt; His brothers Gansevoort and Allan continued their attendance a few months longer, Gansevoort until March the next year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Parker 1996, 56&quot;/&gt; &quot;The ubiquitous classical references in Melville's published writings,&quot; as Melville scholar [[Merton M</span>
				<span class='text'>Sealts, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>Merton Sealts]] observed, &quot;suggest that his study of ancient history, biography, and literature during his school days left a lasting impression on both his thought and his art, as did his almost encyclopedic knowledge of both the Old and the New Testaments&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sealts (1988), 18&lt;/ref&gt;In December Melville's father Allan returned from New York City by steamboat, but ice forced him to travel the last seventy miles for two days and two nights in an open horse carriage at two degrees below zero, with the result that he developed a cold</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; In early January he began to show &quot;signs of delirium&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Delbanco (2005), 24&lt;/ref&gt; and his situation grew worse until he – in the words of his wife – &quot;by reason of severe suffering was deprive'd of his Intellect</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Parker (1996), 57&lt;/ref&gt; Two months before reaching fifty, Allan Melville died on 28 January 1832</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 58&lt;/ref&gt; Since Melville was no longer attending school, he must have witnessed these scenes: twenty years later he described such a death of Pierre's father in ''Pierre'' (bk</span>
				<span class='text'>4 ch</span>
				<span class='text'>2)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 63&lt;/ref&gt;=== 1832–1838: After father's death ===Two months after his father's death, Gansevoort entered the cap and fur business</span>
				<span class='text'>Maria sought consolation in her faith and in April was admitted as a member of the First Reformed Dutch Church</span>
				<span class='text'>Uncle Peter Gansevoort, who was one of the directors of the New York State Bank, got Herman a job as clerk for $150 a year</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Parker 1996, 68&quot;&gt;Parker (1996), 68&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of his emotional response to all the drama in his young life is a question biographers answer by citing from ''[[Redburn]]'': &quot;I had learned to think much and bitterly before my time,&quot; the narrator remarks, adding &quot;I must not think of those delightful days, before my father became a bankrupt</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>nd we removed from the city; for when I think of those days, something rises up in my throat and almost strangles me</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Delbanco 2005, 23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Parker 1996, 68&quot;/&gt;When Melville's grandfather Melvill died at on 16 September 1832, it turned out that Allan had borrowed more than his share of the inheritance</span>
				<span class='text'>He left Maria Melville only $20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 76–78&lt;/ref&gt; The widowed grandmother died on 12 April 1833</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 82&lt;/ref&gt; Melville did his job well at the bank; though he was only fourteen in 1834, the bank considered him competent enough to be sent over to [[Schenectady]] on an errand</span>
				<span class='text'>Not much else is known from this period, except that he was very fond of drawing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Parker 1996, 95&quot;&gt;Parker (1996), 95&lt;/ref&gt; The visual arts became a lifelong interest</span>
				<span class='text'>round May 1834 the Melvilles moved to another house in Albany, a three-story brick house</span>
				<span class='text'>That same month a fire destroyed Gansevoort's skin-preparing factory, which left him with personnel he could neither use nor afford</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead he pulled Melville out of the bank to man the cap and fur store</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Parker 1996, 95&quot;/&gt; (Biographer Andrew Delbanco says that Gansevoort was doing so well he could hire his younger brother until a fire broke out in 1835, destroying both factory and the store</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Delbanco (2005), 25&lt;/ref&gt;) In any case, his older brother Gansevoort served as a role model for Melville in various ways</span>
				<span class='text'>In early 1834 Gansevoort had become a member of the Albany's Young Men's Association for Mutual Improvement, and in January 1835 Melville became a member as well</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 97&lt;/ref&gt;In 1835, while still working in the store, Melville enrolled in Albany Classical School, perhaps using Maria's part of the proceeds from the sale of the estate of his maternal grandmother in March 1835</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 98&lt;/ref&gt; In September of the following year Herman was back in Albany Academy, in the Latin course</span>
				<span class='text'>He also joined debating societies, in an apparent effort to make up as much as he could for his missed years of schooling</span>
				<span class='text'>In this period he also became acquainted with Shakespeare's ''[[Macbeth]]'' at least, and teased his sisters with a passage from the witch scenes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 107&lt;/ref&gt;In March 1837 he was again withdrawn from Albany Academy</span>
				<span class='text'>Gansevoort had copies of John Todd's ''Index Rerum'', a blank book, more of a register, in which one could index remarkable passages from books one had read, for easy retrieval</span>
				<span class='text'>Among the sample entries was &quot;Pequot, beautiful description of the war with,&quot; with a short title reference to the place in Benjamin Trumbull's ''A Complete History of Connecticut'' (1797 or 1818) where the description could be found</span>
				<span class='text'>The two surviving volumes are the best evidence for Melville's reading in this period, because there is little doubt that Gansevoort's reading served him as a guide</span>
				<span class='text'>The entries include books that Melville later used for ''Moby-Dick'' and ''Clarel'', such as &quot;Parsees—of India—an excellent description of their character, &amp; religion &amp; an account of their descent—East India Sketch Book p</span>
				<span class='text'>21</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 108–9&lt;/ref&gt; Other entries are on Panther, the pirate's cabin, and storm at sea from [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s ''[[The Red Rover]]'', Saint-Saba</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 110&lt;/ref&gt;That April the [[Panic of 1837|nationwide economic panic]] forced Gansevoort to file for bankruptcy and Uncle Thomas Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>secretly planned to leave Pittsfield, where he had not paid taxes on the farm</span>
				<span class='text'>On June 5 Maria informed the younger children that they had to move to some village where the rent was cheaper than in Albany</span>
				<span class='text'>Gansevoort became a Law student in New York City and Herman took care of the farm while his uncle settled in [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]], Illinois</span>
				<span class='text'>That summer Melville decided to become a schoolteacher</span>
				<span class='text'>He got a position at Sikes District School near [[Lenox, Massachusetts]], where he taught some thirty students of various ages, including his own</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 117&lt;/ref&gt;His term over, he returned to his mother in 1838</span>
				<span class='text'>In February he was elected president of the Philo Logos Society, which Peter Gansevoort invited to move into Stanwix Hall for no rent</span>
				<span class='text'>Many chambers were vacant as a result of the economic crisis</span>
				<span class='text'>In March 1838 Melville published in the ''Albany Microscope'' two polemical letters about issues in the debating societies he was engaged in, but it is not entirely clear what the polemic was about</span>
				<span class='text'>Biographers Leon Howard and Hershel Parker suggest that the real issue was the youthful desire to exercise his rhetoric skills in public, and the first appearance in print would have been an exciting experience for all young men involved</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 112 and 124&lt;/ref&gt;In May the Melvilles moved to Lansingburgh, almost a dozen miles north of Albany, into a [[Herman Melville House (Troy, New York)|rented house]] on the east side of the river in what is now [[Troy, New York|Troy]], at 1st Avenue and 114th Street</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 126&lt;/ref&gt; The family's retreat was now complete: from the metropolis to a provincial city to a village</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Delbanco (2005), 26&lt;/ref&gt; What Melville was doing after his term at Sikes ended until November, or if he even had a job after that, remains a mystery</span>
				<span class='text'>Apparently he courted a local Lansingburgh girl sometime during the summer, but nothing else is known</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 126, 128–9&lt;/ref&gt;On 7 November Melville arrived in Lansingburgh</span>
				<span class='text'>Where he had come from is unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>Five days later he paid for a term at Lansingburgh Academy, where he took a course in surveying and engineering</span>
				<span class='text'>In April 1839 Peter Gansevoort wrote a letter to get Herman a job in the Engineer Department of the Erie Canal, saying that his nephew &quot;possesses the ambition to make himself useful in a business which he desires to make his profession,&quot; but no job resulted</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 136–7&lt;/ref&gt;Melville's first known published essay came only weeks after he failed to find a job as an engineer</span>
				<span class='text'>Using the unexplained initials L</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 184&lt;/ref&gt;On January 3, 1841, Melville sailed from [[Fairhaven, Massachusetts]], on the whaler ''Acushnet'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Parker 1996, 185&quot;/&gt; which was bound for the Pacific Ocean</span>
				<span class='text'>He was later to comment that his life began that day</span>
				<span class='text'>The vessel sailed around [[Cape Horn]] and traveled to the South Pacific</span>
				<span class='text'>Melville left few direct accounts of the events of this 18-month voyage, although his whaling romance, ''Moby-Dick; or, The Whale,'' probably describes many aspects of life on board the ''Acushnet''</span>
				<span class='text'>Melville deserted the ''Acushnet'' in the [[Marquesas Islands]] in July 1842</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Miller, 5&lt;/ref&gt;For three weeks he lived among the [[Typee]] natives, who were called [[cannibals]] by the two other tribal groups on the island—though they treated Melville very well</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Typee]]'', Melville's first book, describes a brief love affair with a beautiful native girl, Fayaway, who generally &quot;wore the garb of Eden&quot; and came to epitomize the guileless [[noble savage]] in the popular imagination</span>
				<span class='text'>elville did not seem to be concerned about the consequences of leaving the ''Acushnet''</span>
				<span class='text'>He boarded an Australian whale ship, the ''Lucy Ann'', bound for [[Tahiti]]; took part in a mutiny and was briefly jailed in the native ''Calabooza Beretanee''</span>
				<span class='text'>After release, he spent several months as [[Beachcombing|beachcomber]] and island rover ('omoo' in Tahitian), eventually crossing over to [[Moorea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He signed articles on yet another whaler for a six-month cruise (November 1842 − April 1843), which terminated in [[Honolulu]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After working as a clerk for four months, he joined the crew of the [[frigate]] {{USS|United States|1797|6}}, which reached Boston in October 1844</span>
				<span class='text'>He drew from these experiences in his books ''Typee'', ''[[Omoo]]'', and ''[[White-Jacket]]</span>
				<span class='text'>'The encounter with the wide ocean, seemingly abandoned by God, led Melville to experience a &quot;metaphysical estrangement,&quot; Milder believes</span>
				<span class='text'>His social thought was influenced in two ways by his specific adventures in the Pacific</span>
				<span class='text'>First, by birth and breeding Melville belonged to the genteel classes, but found himself not only placed among but also sympathizing with the &quot;disinherited commons</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Second, his acquaintance with the cultures of Polynesia enabled him to view the West from an outsider's perspective</span>

				<span class='text'>Though based upon his own adventures, the book is not a strict autobiography, if only because Melville's later experiences in Tahiti and the Sandwich Islands are worked into the narrative as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither is it a fictional romance</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, scholar Robert Milder calls ''Typee'' &quot;an appealing mixture of adventure, anecdote, ethnography, and social criticism presented with a genial latitudinarianism that gave novelty to a South Sea idyll at once erotically suggestive and romantically chaste</span>

				<span class='text'>With the success of ''Typee,'' the Boston publisher subsequently accepted ''[[Omoo]]'' sight unseen</span>

				<span class='text'>The couple honeymooned in Canada and settled in a house on Fourth Avenue in New York City</span>
				<span class='text'>Melville wrote a long, philosophical work,''[[Mardi]]'', an allegorical narrative that proved a disappointment for readers who wanted another rollicking and exotic sea yarn</span>
				<span class='text'>The book began as another South Sea story but, as he wrote, Melville left that genre behind, first in favor of &quot;a romance of the narrator Taji and the lost maiden Yillah,&quot; and then &quot;to an allegorical voyage of the philosopher Babbalanja and his companions through the imaginary archipelago of Mardi</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Milder 1988, 431&quot;/&gt;On 16 February 1848 the Melvilles' first child, Malcolm, was born,&lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 614&lt;/ref&gt; which may have stirred memories of his own father</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Milder (1988), 432&lt;/ref&gt; Melville based the book on his first sea voyage of 1839 to Liverpool, just as he drew on his experiences of 1844 aboard the warship ''United States'' for ''White-Jacket'' (1850)</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1850, the Melvilles moved to Massachusetts</span>
				<span class='text'>They had a total of four children together over the following years: two sons and two daughters</span>
				<span class='text'>== 1850–1851: Hawthorne and ''Moby-Dick'' ===At first his work on ''Moby-Dick'' moved swiftly</span>

				<span class='text'>Richard Henry Dana]], also a sea author, saying he was already &quot;half way&quot; done</span>
				<span class='text'>In June he described the book to his English publisher as &quot;a romance of adventure, founded upon certain wild legends in the Southern Sperm Whale Fisheries,&quot; and promised it would be done by the fall</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the manuscript for the book has not survived, it is impossible to know for sure its state at this critical juncture</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the next several months, Melville radically transformed his initial plan, conceiving what has been described as &quot;the most ambitious book ever conceived by an [[American literature|American writer]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Delbanco (2005), 124&lt;/ref&gt;In September 1850 the Melvilles purchased [[Arrowhead (Herman Melville)|Arrowhead]], a farm house in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]]</span>
				<span class='text'>(It is now preserved as a house museum and has been designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Here Melville and Elizabeth lived for 13 years</span>
				<span class='text'>While living at Arrowhead, Melville befriended the author [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], who lived in nearby [[Lenox, Massachusetts|Lenox]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Melville wrote ten letters to Hawthorne, &quot;all of them effusive, profound, deeply affectionate&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bezanson (1986), 180</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Melville was inspired and encouraged by his new relationship with Hawthorne&lt;ref&gt;In an essay on Hawthorne's ''Mosses'' in the ''Literary Review'' (August 1850), Melville wrote: {{quote|To what infinite height of loving wonder and admiration I may yet be borne, when by repeatedly banquetting on these Mosses, I shall have thoroughly incorporated their whole stuff into my being,--that, I can not tell</span>
				<span class='text'>But already I feel that this Hawthorne has dropped germinous seeds into my soul</span>
				<span class='text'>He expands and deepens down, the more I contemplate him; and further, and further, shoots his strong New-England roots into the hot soil of my Southern soul</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; during the period that he was writing ''Moby-Dick</span>

				<span class='text'>In between these dates, on 22 October 1850, the Melvilles' second child, Stanwix, was born</span>

				<span class='text'>We hope one of the earliest precautions will be to keep him stringently secluded from pen and ink</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996), 131–132&lt;/ref&gt;}}On 22 May 1853 Elizabeth (Bessie) was born, the Melvilles' third child and first daughter, and on or about that day Herman finished work on ''[[Isle of the Cross]]''—one relative wrote that 'The Isle of the Cross' is almost a twin sister of the little one</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&quot; Herman traveled to New York to discuss it with his publisher, but later wrote that Harper &amp; Brothers was &quot;prevented&quot; from publishing his manuscript, presumed to be ''Isle of the Cross'', which has been lost</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (2002), 155&lt;/ref&gt;Between 1853 and 1856, Melville published fourteen tales and sketches in ''Putnam''s and ''Harper''s magazines</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1856 a selection of the short fiction, including &quot;[[Bartleby, the Scrivener]]&quot; and &quot;[[Benito Cereno]]&quot;, was published as ''[[The Piazza Tales]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>n late 1856 Melville made a six-month [[Grand Tour]] of the British Isles and the Mediterranean</span>
				<span class='text'>While in England, he spent three days with Hawthorne, who had taken an embassy position there</span>
				<span class='text'>At the seaside village of [[Southport]], amid the sand dunes where they had stopped to smoke cigars, they had a conversation which Hawthorne later described in his journal:{{quote|Melville, as he always does, began to reason of Providence and futurity, and of everything that lies beyond human ken, and informed me that he 'pretty much made up his mind to be annihilated'; but still he does not seem to rest in that anticipation; and, I think, will never rest until he gets hold of a definite belief</span>
				<span class='text'>It is strange how he persists—and has persisted ever since I knew him, and probably long before—in wandering to-and-fro over these deserts, as dismal and monotonous as the sand hills amid which we were sitting</span>
				<span class='text'>He can neither believe, nor be comfortable in his unbelief; and he is too honest and courageous not to try to do one or the other</span>

				<span class='text'>Henty]], rediscovered Melville's novels in the late nineteenth century, the author had a modest revival of popularity in England, though not in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote a series of poems, with prose head notes, inspired by his early experiences at sea</span>
				<span class='text'>He published them in two collections, each issued in a tiny edition of 25 copies for his relatives and friends</span>
				<span class='text'>Of these, scholar Robert Milder calls ''John Marr and Other Poems'' (1888), &quot;the finest of his late verse collections</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Milder (1988), 445&lt;/ref&gt; The second privately printed volume is ''[[Timoleon (Melville poem)|Timoleon]]'' (1891)</span>
				<span class='text'>ntrigued by one of these poems, Melville began to rework the headnote, expanding it first as a short story and eventually as a novella</span>
				<span class='text'>He worked on it on and off for several years, but when he died in September 1891, the piece was unfinished</span>
				<span class='text'> His widow Elizabeth added notes and edited it, but the manuscript was not discovered until 1919, by Raymond Weaver, his first biographer</span>
				<span class='text'>He worked at transcribing and editing a full text, which he published in 1924 as ''[[Billy Budd, Sailor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' It was an immediate critical success in England and soon one in the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>The authoritative version was published in 1962, after two scholars studied the papers for several years</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|''New York Times'' obituary notice, 29 September 1891, which misspelled Melville's then-unpopular masterpiece as ''Mobie Dick''</span>
				<span class='text'>]Melville died at his home in New York City early on the morning of September 28, 1891, at age 72</span>
				<span class='text'>The doctor listed &quot;cardiac dilation&quot; on the death certificate</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Delbanco319&gt;Delbanco (2005), 319&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred in the [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[The Bronx]], New York</span>
				<span class='text'>A common story recounts that his ''[[New York Times]]'' obituary called him &quot;''Henry'' Melville,&quot; implying that he was unknown and unappreciated at his time of death, but the story is not true</span>
				<span class='text'>A later article was published on October 6 in the same paper, referring to him as &quot;the late Hiram Melville,&quot; but this appears to have been a typesetting error</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Parker (2002), 921&lt;/ref&gt;== Writing style ==Melville's writing style shows enormous changes throughout the years as well as consistencies</span>
				<span class='text'>As early a juvenile piece as &quot;Fragments from a Writing Desk&quot; from 1839, scholar Sealts points out, already shows &quot;a number of elements that anticipate Melville's later writing, especially his characteristic habit of abundant literary allusion</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sealts (1987), 461&lt;/ref&gt; ''Typee'' and ''Omoo'' were documentary adventures that called for a division of the narrative in short chapters</span>
				<span class='text'>Such compact organization bears the risk of fragmentation when applied to a lengthy work such as ''Mardi'', but with ''Redburn'' and ''White Jacket,'' Melville turned the short chapter into an instrument of form and concentration</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Berthoff (1962), 176&lt;/ref&gt; A number of chapters of ''Moby-Dick'' are no longer than two pages in standard editions, and an extreme example is Chapter 122, consisting of a single paragraph of 36 words (including the thrice-repeated &quot;Um, um, um</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;) The skillful handling of chapters in ''Moby-Dick'' is one of the most fully developed Melvillean signatures, and is a measure of &quot;his manner of mastery as a writer</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berthoff 1962, 177&quot;&gt;Berthoff (1962), 177&lt;/ref&gt; Individual chapters have become &quot;a touchstone for appreciation of Melville's art and for explanation&quot; of his themes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Berthoff (1962), 179&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the chapters in ''Pierre'', called Books, are divided into short numbered sections, seemingly an &quot;odd formal compromise&quot; between Melville's natural length and his purpose to write a regular romance that called for longer chapters</span>
				<span class='text'>As satirical elements were introduced, the chapter arrangement restores &quot;some degree of organization and pace from the chaos</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berthoff 1962, 177&quot;/&gt; The usual chapter unit then reappears for ''Israel Potter'', ''The Confidence-Man'' and even ''Clarel'', but only becomes &quot;a vital part in the whole creative achievement&quot; again in the juxtaposition of accents and of topics in ''Billy Budd''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Berthoff 1962, 177&quot;/&gt;Melville's early works were &quot;increasingly baroque&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bezanson 1986, 203&quot;&gt;Bezanson (1986), 203&lt;/ref&gt; in style, and with ''Moby-Dick'' Melville's vocabulary had grown superabundant</span>
				<span class='text'>Bezanson calls it an &quot;immensely varied style</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bezanson 1986, 203&quot;/&gt; Three characteristic uses of language can be recognized</span>
				<span class='text'>First, the exaggerated repetition of words, as in the series &quot;pitiable,&quot; &quot;pity,&quot; &quot;pitied,&quot; and &quot;piteous&quot; (Ch</span>
				<span class='text'>81, &quot;The Pequod Meets the Virgin&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>A second typical device is the use of unusual adjective-noun combinations, as in &quot;concentrating brow&quot; and &quot;immaculate manliness&quot; (Ch</span>
				<span class='text'>26, &quot;Knights and Squires&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Berthoff (1962), 163&lt;/ref&gt; A third characteristic is the presence of a participial modifier to emphasize and to reinforce the already established expectations of the reader, as the words &quot;preluding&quot; and &quot;foreshadowing&quot; (&quot;so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&quot; &quot;In this foreshadowing interval</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Berthoff (1962), 164&lt;/ref&gt;After his use of hyphenated compounds in ''Pierre'', Melville was less exploratory and less provocative in his choices of words and phrases</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead of providing a lead &quot;into possible meanings and openings-out of the material at hand,&quot; the style now served &quot;to crystallize governing impressions</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The diction no longer attracted attention to itself, except as an effort at exact definition</span>
				<span class='text'>The language reflects a &quot;controlling intelligence, of right judgment and completed understanding</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Berthoff (1962), 165&lt;/ref&gt; The sense of free inquiry and exploration which infused his earlier writing and accounted for its &quot;rare force and expansiveness,&quot; tended to give way to &quot;static enumeration</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Added &quot;seriousness of consideration&quot; came at the cost of losing &quot;pace and momentum</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berthoff 1962, 170&quot;&gt;Berthoff (1962), 170&lt;/ref&gt; The verbal music and kinetic energy of ''Moby-Dick'' seem &quot;relatively muted, even withheld&quot; in the later works</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Berthoff 1962, 170&quot;/&gt;Melville's paragraphing, in his best work, is the virtuous result of &quot;compactness of form and free assembling of unanticipated further data,&quot; such as when the mysterious sperm whale is compared with Exodus's invisibility of God's face in the final paragraph of Chapter 86 (&quot;The Tail&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Berthoff (1962), 175&lt;/ref&gt; Over time Melville's paragraphs became shorter as his sentences grew longer, until he arrived at the &quot;one-sentence paragraphing characteristic of his later prose</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The opening chapter of ''The Confidence-Man'' counts fifteen paragraphs, seven of which consist of only one, elaborate, sentence, and four that have only two sentences</span>
				<span class='text'>His use of similar technique in ''Billy Budd'' contributes in large part, Berthoff says, to its &quot;remarkable narrative economy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Berthoff (1962), 173&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote= Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city</span>

				<span class='text'>source=— Melville paraphrases the Bible in &quot;The Whale as a Dish,&quot; ''Moby-Dick'' Ch</span>
				<span class='text'>5}}In Nathalia Wright's view, Melville's sentences generally have a looseness of structure, easy to use for devices as catalogue and allusion, parallel and refrain, proverb and allegory</span>
				<span class='text'>The length of his clauses may vary greatly, but the &quot;torterous&quot; writing in ''Pierre'' and ''The Confidence-Man'' is there to convey feeling, not thought</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike [[Henry James]], who was an innovator of sentence ordering to render the subtlest nuances in thought, Melville made few such innovations</span>
				<span class='text'>His domain is the mainstream of English prose, with its rhythm and simplicity influenced by the King James Bible</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wright (1949), 168&lt;/ref&gt;Another important characteristic of Melville's writing style is in its echoes and overtones</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wright (1940), 196 n</span>
				<span class='text'>59&lt;/ref&gt; Melville's imitation of certain distinct styles is responsible for this</span>
				<span class='text'>His three most important sources, in order, are the Bible, Shakespeare, and Milton</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bercaw (1987), 10&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Nathalia Wright has identified three stylistic categories of Biblical influence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wright (1940), 196–197&lt;/ref&gt; Direct quotation from any of the sources is slight; only one sixths of his Biblical allusions can be qualified as such</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wright (1949), 137&lt;/ref&gt;First, far more unmarked than acknowledged quotations occur, some favorites even numerous times throughout his whole body of work, taking on the nature of refrains</span>
				<span class='text'>Examples of this idiom are the injunctions to be 'as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves,' 'death on a pale horse,' 'the man of sorrows', the 'many mansions of heaven;' proverbs 'as the hairs on our heads are numbered,' 'pride goes before a fall,' 'the wages of sin is death;' adverbs and pronouns as 'verily, whoso, forasmuch as; phrases as come to pass, children's children, the fat of the land, vanity of vanities, outer darkness, the apple of his eye, Ancient of Days, the rose of Sharon</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;ref&gt;Wright (1949), 139–141&lt;/ref&gt;Second, there are paraphrases of individual and combined verses</span>
				<span class='text'>Redburn's &quot;Thou shalt not lay stripes upon these Roman citizens&quot; makes use of language of the Ten Commandments in [[Book of Exodus|Ex]]</span>
				<span class='text'>0,{{refn|3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me etcetera</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>group=lower-alpha}}Third, certain Hebraisms are used, such as a succession of genitives (&quot;all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob&quot;), the cognate accusative (&quot;I dreamed a dream,&quot; &quot;Liverpool was created with the Creation&quot;), and the parallel (&quot;Closer home does it go than a rammer; and fighting with steel is a play without ever an interlude&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'> passage from ''Redburn'' (see quotebox) shows how all these different ways of alluding interlock and result in a fabric texture of Biblical language, though there is very little direct quotation</span>
				<span class='text'>{Quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote= The other world beyond this, which was longed for by the devout before Columbus' time, was found in the New; and the deep-sea land, that first struck these soundings, brought up the soil of Earth's Paradise</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wright (1949), 145–6&lt;/ref&gt;}}In addition to this, Melville successfully imitates three Biblical strains: he sustains the apocalyptic for a whole chapter of ''Mardi;'' the prophetic strain is expressed in ''Moby-Dick'', most notably in [[Father Mapple]]'s sermon; and the tradition of the [[Psalms]] is imitated at length in ''The Confidence-Man''</span>
				<span class='text'>elville owned an edition of Shakespeare's works by 1849, and his reading of it greatly influenced the style of his next book, ''Moby-Dick'' (1851)</span>
				<span class='text'>The language of &quot;Shakespeare went far beyond all other influences&quot; upon the book, in that it inspired Melville to discover his own full strength</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Matthiessen 1941, 424&quot;&gt;Matthiessen (1941), 424&lt;/ref&gt; On almost every page, debts to Shakespeare can be discovered</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing&quot; at the end of &quot;Cetology&quot; (Ch</span>
				<span class='text'>2) echoe the famous phrase in ''[[Macbeth]]:'' &quot;Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthiessen 1941, 424&quot;/&gt; Ahab's first extended speech to the crew, in the &quot;Quarter-Deck&quot; (Ch</span>
				<span class='text'>6), is &quot;virtually blank verse&quot; and so is Ahab's soliloquy at the beginning of &quot;Sunset&quot; (Ch</span>
				<span class='text'>7):'I leave a white and turbid wake;/ Pale waters, paler cheeks, where'er I sail</span>
				<span class='text'> The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm/ My track; let them; but first I pass</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;ref&gt;Matthiessen (1941), 426&lt;/ref&gt; Through Shakespeare, Melville infused ''Moby-Dick'' with a power of expression he had not previously possessed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Matthiessen (1941)</span>
				<span class='text'>425&lt;/ref&gt; Reading Shakespeare had been &quot;a catalytic agent&quot; for Melville, one that transformed his writing &quot;from limited reporting to the expression of profound natural forces</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Matthiessen (1941), 428&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which Melville assimilated Shakespeare is evident in the description of Ahab, which ends in language &quot;that suggests Shakespeare's but is not an imitation of it: 'Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked from the skies and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!' The imaginative richness of the final phrase seems particularly Shakespearean, &quot;but its two key words appear only once each in the plays</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>nd to neither of these usages is Melville indebted for his fresh combination</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Matthiessen (1941), 428-9&lt;/ref&gt; Melville's diction depended upon no source, and his prose is not based on anybody else's verse but on &quot;a sense of speech rhythm</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Matthiessen (1941), 430&lt;/ref&gt; According to Matthiessen, Melville's mastering of Shakespeare supplied him with verbal resources that enabled him &quot;to make language itself dramatic&quot; through three essential techniques:* To rely on verbs of action, &quot;which lend their dynamic pressure to both movement and meaning</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The effective tension caused by the contrast of &quot;thou launchest navies of full-freighted worlds&quot; and &quot;there's that in here that still remains indifferent&quot; in &quot;The Candles&quot; (Ch</span>
				<span class='text'>119) makes the last clause lead to a &quot;compulsion to strike the breast,&quot; which suggests &quot;how thoroughly the drama has come to inhere in the words;&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mathiessen (1941), 430-431&lt;/ref&gt;* The Shakespearean energy of verbal compounds was not lost on him (&quot;full-freighted&quot;);* And, finally, Melville learned how to handle &quot;the quickened sense of life that comes from making one part as speech act as another - for example, 'earthquake' as an adjective, or the coining of 'placeless,' an adjective from a noun</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Matthiessen (1941), 431&lt;/ref&gt;Melville's style seamlessly flows over into theme, because all these borrowings have an artistic purpose, which is to suggest an appearance &quot;larger and more significant than life&quot; for characters and themes that are &quot;essentially simple and mundane</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright 1940, 198&quot;&gt;Wright (1940), 198&lt;/ref&gt; The allusions suggest that beyond the world of appearances another world exists, one that &quot;exerts influence upon this world, and in which ultimate truth resides</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Moreover, the ancient background thus suggested for Melville's narratives – ancient allusions being next in number to the Biblical ones – invests them &quot;with a certain timeless quality</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright 1940, 198&quot;/&gt;==Critical response=====Contemporary criticism===Melville was not financially successful as a writer, having earned just over $10,000 for his writing during his lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Delbanco, 7&lt;/ref&gt; After his success with [[Travel literature|travelogues]] based on voyages to the South Seas and stories based on misadventures in the merchant marine and navy, Melville's popularity declined dramatically</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1876, all of his books were out of print</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Delbanco, 294&lt;/ref&gt; In the later years of his life and during the years after his death, he was recognized, if at all, as a minor figure in American literature</span>

				<span class='text'>==Critical editions===In the 1960s, [[Northwestern University Press]], in alliance with the [[Newberry Library]] and the [[Modern Language Association]], launched a project to edit and published reliable [[critical text]]s of Melville's complete works, including unpublished poems, journals, and correspondence</span>
				<span class='text'>The aim of the editors was to present a text &quot;as close as possible to the author's intention as surviving evidence permits&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The volumes have extensive appendices, including textual variants from each of the editions published in Melville's lifetime, an historical note on the publishing history and critical reception, and related documents</span>
				<span class='text'>In many cases, it was not possible to establish a &quot;definitive text,&quot; but the edition supplies all evidence available at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the texts were prepared with financial support from the United States Department of Education, no royalties are charged, and they have been widely reprinted</span>
				<span class='text'>==The Melville Society===[[File:Herman melville</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|Herman Melville in 1868]]In 1945, The Melville Society was founded, a non-profit organisation dedicated to the study of Melville's life and works</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1969 and 2003 it published 125 issues of ''Melville Society Extracts,'' which are now freely available on the society's website</span>
				<span class='text'>Since 1999 it publishes ''Leviathan: A Journal of Melville Studies'', currently three issues a year, published by Johns Hopkins University Press</span>
				<span class='text'>==Melville's poetry===Melville did not publish poetry until late in life, and his reputation as a poet was not high until late in the 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>elville, says recent literary critic Lawrence Buell, “is justly said to be nineteenth-century America’s leading poet after [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]] and [[Emily Dickinson|Dickinson]], yet his poetry remains largely unread even by many Melvillians</span>
				<span class='text'> True, Buell concedes, even more than most Victorian poets, Melville turned to poetry as an “instrument of meditation rather than for the sake of melody or linguistic play</span>
				<span class='text'> It is also true that he turned from fiction to poetry late in life</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet he wrote twice as much poetry as Dickinson and probably as many lines as Whitman, and he wrote distinguished poetry for a quarter of a century, twice as long as his career publishing prose narratives</span>
				<span class='text'>The three novels of the 1850s which Melville worked on most seriously to present his philosophical explorations, ''Moby-Dick'', ''Pierre'', and ''The Confidence Man'', seem to make the step to philosophical poetry a natural one rather than simply a consequence of commercial failure</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Serlin, David Harley</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The Dialogue of Gender in Melville's ''The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids'',&quot; ''Modern Language Studies'' 25</span>
				<span class='text'> (1995): 80–87</span>
				<span class='text'>Note: These two writings are separate but often read together for the full effect of Melville's purpose</span>
				<span class='text'>In both these works many phallic symbols are represented (such as the swords and snuff powder which represented a lack of semen in the bachelors</span>
				<span class='text'> Not only this, but in the 'Tartarus of Maids' there was a detailed description of how the main character arrived at the 'Tartarus of Maids</span>
				<span class='text'> This description was intended to resemble that of the vaginal canal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Creech, ''Closet Writing: The Case of Melville's Pierre'', 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;Rosenberg, 70–78&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics, particularly those interested in [[gender studies]], have explored the male-dominant social structures in Melville's fiction</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Delblanco, Andrew 1992&quot;&gt;see Delblanco, Andrew</span>
				<span class='text'>''American Literary History'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Alvin Sandberg claimed that the short story &quot;[[Paradise of Bachelors and Tartarus of Maids|The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids]]&quot; offers &quot;an exploration of impotency, a portrayal of a man retreating to an all-male childhood to avoid confrontation with sexual manhood,&quot; from which the narrator engages in &quot;congenial&quot; digressions in heterogeneity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sandberg, Alvin</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Erotic Patterns in 'The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids', &quot; Literature and Psychology 18</span>
				<span class='text'> (1968): 2–8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In line with this view, Warren Rosenberg argues the homosocial &quot;Paradise of Bachelors&quot; is shown to be &quot;superficial and sterile&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Rosenberg/&gt;David Harley Serlin observes in the second half of Melville's diptych, &quot;The Tartarus of Maids,&quot; the narrator gives voice to the oppressed women he observes: {{quote|As other scholars have noted, the &quot;slave&quot; image here has two clear connotations</span>
				<span class='text'>One describes the exploitation of the women's physical labor, and the other describes the exploitation of the women's reproductive organs</span>
				<span class='text'>Of course, as models of women's oppression, the two are clearly intertwined</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;The Dialogue of Gender in Melville's ''The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids'',&quot; ''Modern Language Studies'' 25</span>
				<span class='text'> (1995): 80–87&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the end Serlin says that the narrator is never fully able to come to terms with the contrasting masculine and feminine modalities</span>
				<span class='text'>ssues of sexuality have been observed in other works as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Rosenberg notes Taji, in ''Mardi'', and the protagonist in ''Pierre'' &quot;think they are saving young 'maidens in distress' (Yillah and Isabel) out of the purest of reasons but both are also conscious of a lurking sexual motive&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Rosenberg/&gt; When Taji kills the old priest holding Yillah captive, he says, {{quote|[R]emorse smote me hard; and like lightning I asked myself whether the death deed I had done was sprung of virtuous motive, the rescuing of a captive from thrall, or whether beneath the pretense I had engaged in this fatal affray for some other selfish purpose, the companionship of a beautiful maid</span>

				<span class='text'>p</span>
				<span class='text'>132</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}In ''Pierre,'' the motive of the protagonist's sacrifice for Isabel is admitted: &quot;womanly beauty and not womanly ugliness invited him to champion the right&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Melville, Herman</span>
				<span class='text'>''Pierre'', New York: Grove Press, 1957</span>
				<span class='text'>p</span>
				<span class='text'>151</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberg argues, {{quote|This awareness of a double motive haunts both books and ultimately destroys their protagonists who would not fully acknowledge the dark underside of their idealism</span>
				<span class='text'>The epistemological quest and the transcendental quest for love and belief are consequently sullied by the erotic</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Rosenberg/&gt;}}Rosenberg says that Melville fully explores the theme of sexuality in his major epic poem, ''Clarel</span>
				<span class='text'>' When the narrator is separated from Ruth, with whom he has fallen in love, he is free to explore other sexual (and religious) possibilities before deciding at the end of the poem to participate in the ritualistic order represented by marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>In the course of the poem, &quot;he considers every form of sexual orientation – celibacy, homosexuality, hedonism, and heterosexuality – raising the same kinds of questions as when he considers Islam or Democracy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Rosenberg/&gt;Some passages and sections of Melville's works demonstrate his willingness to address all forms of sexuality, including the homoerotic, in his works</span>
				<span class='text'>Commonly noted examples from ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' are the &quot;marriage bed&quot; episode involving Ishmael and Queequeg, which is interpreted as [[male bonding]]; and the &quot;Squeeze of the Hand&quot; chapter, describing the camaraderie of sailors' extracting spermaceti from a dead whale</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;E</span>
				<span class='text'>Haviland Miller, ''Melville'', New York, 1975</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberg notes that critics say that &quot;Ahab's pursuit of the whale, which they suggest can be associated with the feminine in its shape, mystery, and in its naturalness, represents the ultimate fusion of the epistemological and sexual quest</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Rosenberg/&gt; In addition, he notes that Billy Budd's physical attractiveness is described in quasi-feminine terms: &quot;As the Handsome Sailor, Billy Budd's position aboard the seventy-four was something analogous to that of a rustic beauty transplanted from the provinces and brought into competition with the highborn dames of the court</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Rosenberg/&gt;===Law and literature===Since the late 20th century, ''Billy Budd'' has become a central text in the field of legal scholarship known as law and literature</span>
				<span class='text'>In the novel, Billy, a handsome and popular young sailor, is impressed from the merchant vessel ''Rights of Man'' to serve aboard H</span>

				<span class='text'>''Bellipotent'' in the late 1790s, during the war between Revolutionary France and Great Britain</span>
				<span class='text'>He excites the enmity and hatred of the ship's master-at-arms, John Claggart</span>
				<span class='text'> Claggart accuses Billy of phony charges of mutiny and other crimes, and the Captain, the Honorable Edward Fairfax Vere, brings them together for an informal inquiry</span>
				<span class='text'>At this encounter, Billy is frustrated by his stammer, which prevents him from speaking, and strikes Claggart</span>
				<span class='text'>The blow catches Claggart squarely on the forehead and, after a gasp or two, the master-at-arms dies</span>
				<span class='text'>ere immediately convenes a [[court-martial]], at which, after serving as sole witness and as Billy's ''de facto'' counsel, Vere urges the court to convict and sentence Billy to death</span>
				<span class='text'> The trial is recounted in chapter 21, the longest chapter in the book</span>
				<span class='text'>It has become the focus of scholarly controversy; was Captain Vere a good man trapped by bad law, or did he deliberately distort and misrepresent the applicable law to condemn Billy to death?&lt;ref&gt;Weisberg, Richard H</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Failure of the Word: The Lawyer as Protagonist in Modern Fiction'' (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1989), chapters 8 and 9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;== Themes ==As early as 1839, in the juvenile sketch &quot;Fragments from a Writing Desk,&quot; Melville explores a problem which would reappear in the short stories &quot;Bartleby&quot; (1853) and &quot;Benito Cereno&quot; (1855): the impossibility to find common ground for mutual communication</span>
				<span class='text'>The sketch centers on the protagonist and a mute lady, leading scholar Sealts to observe: &quot;Melville's deep concern with expression and communication evidently began early in his career</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sealts (1987), 462&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholar Nathalia Wright, Melville's characters are all preoccupied by the same intense, superhuman and eternal quest for &quot;the absolute amidst its relative manifestations</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright 1949, 77&quot;&gt;Wright (1949), 77&lt;/ref&gt; There can be no doubt that this is the essence of every segment of Melville's whole body of work: &quot;All Melville's plots describe this pursuit, and all his themes represent the delicate and shifting relationship between its truth and its illusion</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright 1949, 77&quot;/&gt; It is not clear, however, what the moral and metaphysical implications of this quest are, because Melville did not distinguish between these two aspects</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wright 1949, 77&quot;/&gt; Throughout his life Melville struggled with and gave shape to the same set of epistemological doubts and the metaphysical issues these doubts engendered</span>
				<span class='text'>An obsession for the limits of knowledge led to the question of God's existence and nature, the indifference of the universe, and the problem of evil</span>
