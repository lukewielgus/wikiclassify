				<span class='text'>The list includes  and  by    and  by   by   by   by   by  and  by </span>
				<span class='text'>Among his favorite directors were Bu√±uel Mizoguchi Bergman Bresson Kurosawa   and </span>
				<span class='text'>With the exception of City Lights the list does not contain any films of the early silent era</span>
				<span class='text'>The reason is that Tarkovsky saw film as an art as only a relatively recent phenomenon with the early film making forming only a prelude</span>
				<span class='text'>The list has also no films or directors from Tarkovskys native Russia although he rated Soviet directors such as   and  highly</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough strongly opposed to commercial cinema in a famous exception Tarkovsky praised the blockbuster film  saying its vision of the future and the relation between man and its destiny is pushing the frontier of cinema as an art</span>
				<span class='text'>He was critical of the brutality and low acting skills but nevertheless impressed by this film</span>
				<span class='text'>name ReferenceB  Cinematic styleTarkovskys films are characterized by  themes extremely s and memorable images of exceptional beauty</span>
				<span class='text'>Recurring motifs are dreams memory childhood running water accompanied by fire rain indoors lections levitation and characters re appearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera</span>
				<span class='text'>He once said Juxtaposing a person with an environment that is boundless collating him with a countless number of people passing by close to him and far away relating a person to the whole world that is the meaning of cinema</span>
				<span class='text'>ÄùTarkovsky included levitation scenes into several of his films most notably Solaris</span>
				<span class='text'>To him these scenes possess great power and are used for their photogenic value and magical inexplicability</span>
				<span class='text'>Water clouds and lections were used by him for their surreal beauty and photogenic value as well as their symbolism such as waves or the forms of brooks or running water</span>
				<span class='text'>Bells and candles are also frequent symbols</span>
				<span class='text'>These are symbols of film sight and sound and Tarkovskys film frequently has themes of self lection</span>
				<span class='text'>arkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called sculpting in time</span>
				<span class='text'>By this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it</span>
				<span class='text'>Unedited movie footage transcribes time in </span>
				<span class='text'>By using long takes and few cuts in his films he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing time lost and the relationship of one moment in time to another</span>
				<span class='text'>p to and including his film  Tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory</span>
				<span class='text'>After Mirror he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the  proposed by  a concentrated action happening in one place within the span of a single day</span>
				<span class='text'>everal of Tarkovskys films have color or black and white sequences</span>
				<span class='text'>This first occurs in the otherwise monochrome  which features a color epilogue of  authentic religious icon paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>All of his films afterwards contain monochrome and in  case  sequences while otherwise being in color</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1966 in an interview conducted shortly after finishing Andrei Rublev Tarkovsky dismissed color film as a commercial gimmick and cast doubt on the idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color</span>
				<span class='text'>He claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors most of the time and that color should theore be used in film mainly to emphasize certain moments but not all the time as this distracts the viewer</span>
				<span class='text'>To him films in color were like moving paintings or photographs which are too beautiful to be a realistic depiction of life</span>
				<span class='text'>Tarkovsky worked in close collaboration with cinematographer  from 1958 to 1972 and much of the visual style of Tarkovskys films can be attributed to this collaboration</span>
