				<span class='text'>Before 1953, annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors</span>
				<span class='text'>After 1953, more films were produced, many of them by young directors</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Khrushchev Thaw]] relaxed Soviet social restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of European and North American literature, films and music</span>

				<span class='text'>Tarkovsky absorbed the idea of the [[auteur theory|auteur]] as a necessary condition for creativity{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}</span>
				<span class='text'>arkovsky's teacher and mentor was [[Mikhail Romm]], who taught many film students who would later become influential film directors</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Impressed by the talent of his student, Chukhrai offered Tarkovsky a position as assistant director for his film ''Clear Skies''</span>

				<span class='text'>They found much in common as they liked the same film directors and shared ideas on cinema and films</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1959, they wrote the script ''Antarctica ‚Äì Distant Country'', which was later published in the ''[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Tarkovsky submitted the script to [[Lenfilm]], but it was rejected</span>
				<span class='text'>They were more successful with the script ''[[The Steamroller and the Violin]]'', which they sold to [[Mosfilm]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This became Tarkovsky's graduation project, earning him his diploma in 1960 and winning First Prize at the New York Student Film Festival in 1961</span>
				<span class='text'>=Career=====Film career in the Soviet Union===Tarkovsky's first feature film was ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' in 1962</span>
				<span class='text'>He had inherited the film from director Eduard Abalov, who had to abort the project</span>

				<span class='text'>''Andrei Rublev'' was not, except for a single screening in Moscow in 1966, immediately released after completion due to problems with Soviet authorities</span>
				<span class='text'>Tarkovsky had to cut the film several times, resulting in several different versions of varying lengths</span>
				<span class='text'>A version of the film was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1969 and won the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Tarkovsky had worked on the screenplay for this film since 1967, under the consecutive titles ''Confession'', ''White day'' and ''A white, white day''</span>
				<span class='text'>From the beginning the film was not well received by Soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived elitist nature</span>
				<span class='text'>Russian authorities placed the film in the &quot;third category,&quot; a severely limited distribution, and only allowed it to be shown in third-class cinemas and workers' clubs</span>
				<span class='text'>Few prints were made and the film-makers received no returns</span>
				<span class='text'>Third category films also placed the film-makers in danger of being accused of wasting public funds, which could have serious effects on their future productivity</span>

				<span class='text'>he last film Tarkovsky completed in the Soviet Union was ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'', inspired by the novel ''[[Roadside Picnic]]'' by the brothers [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Tarkovsky had met the brothers first in 1971 and was in contact with them until his death in 1986</span>
				<span class='text'>Initially he wanted to shoot a film based on their novel ''[[Dead Mountaineer's Hotel]]'' and he developed a raw script</span>
				<span class='text'>Influenced by a discussion with Arkady Strugatsky he changed his plan and began to work on the script based on ''Roadside Picnic''</span>
				<span class='text'>Work on this film began in 1976</span>
				<span class='text'>The production was mired in troubles; improper development of the negatives had ruined all the exterior shots</span>
				<span class='text'>Tarkovsky's relationship with cinematographer [[Georgy Rerberg]] deteriorated to the point where he hired [[Alexander Knyazhinsky]] as a new first cinematographer</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, Tarkovsky suffered a heart attack in April 1978, resulting in further delay</span>
				<span class='text'>The film was completed in 1979 and won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The film was set in 18th-century Russia during the reign of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] and starred [[Natalya Bondarchuk]] and [[Anatoli Papanov]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To get the project approved by [[Goskino]], Tarkovsky submitted a script that was different from the original script, omitting several scenes that were critical of the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|official atheism in the Soviet Union]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After shooting roughly half of the film the project was stopped by Goskino after it became apparent that the film differed from the script submitted to the censors</span>
				<span class='text'>Tarkovsky was reportedly infuriated by this interruption and destroyed most of the film</span>

				<span class='text'>uring 1985, he shot the film ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' in Sweden</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of the year he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer</span>
				<span class='text'>In January 1986, he began treatment in Paris and was joined there by his son, who was finally allowed to leave the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[The Sacrifice]]'' was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and received the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix Sp√©cial du Jury]], the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]] and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury</span>

				<span class='text'>The inscription on his gravestone, which was created by the Russian sculptor [[Ernst Neizvestny]], reads: ''To the man who saw the Angel''</span>
				<span class='text'> controversy emerged in Russia in the early 1990s when it was alleged that Tarkovsky did not die of natural causes but was assassinated by the [[KGB]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Evidence for this hypothesis includes testimonies by former KGB agents who claim that [[Viktor Chebrikov]] gave the order to eradicate Tarkovsky to curtail what the Soviet government and the KGB saw as [[anti-Soviet propaganda]] by Tarkovsky</span>

				<span class='text'>These are symbols of film, sight and sound, and Tarkovsky's film frequently has themes of self-reflection</span>
				<span class='text'>arkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called &quot;sculpting in time&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>By this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it</span>
				<span class='text'>Unedited movie footage transcribes time in [[Real-time (media)|real time]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By using long takes and few cuts in his films, he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing, time lost, and the relationship of one moment in time to another</span>
				<span class='text'>p to, and including, his film ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'', Tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory</span>
				<span class='text'>After ''Mirror'', he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the [[dramatic unities]] proposed by [[Aristotle]]: a concentrated action, happening in one place, within the span of a single day</span>
				<span class='text'>everal of Tarkovsky's films have color or black and white sequences</span>

				<span class='text'>All of his films afterwards contain monochrome, and in ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker's]]'' case [[Sepia tone|sepia]] sequences, while otherwise being in color</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1966, in an interview conducted shortly after finishing ''Andrei Rublev'', Tarkovsky dismissed color film as a &quot;commercial gimmick&quot; and cast doubt on the idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color</span>
				<span class='text'>He claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors most of the time, and that color should therefore be used in film mainly to emphasize certain moments, but not all the time, as this distracts the viewer</span>
				<span class='text'>To him, films in color were like moving paintings or photographs, which are too beautiful to be a realistic depiction of life</span>
