				<span class='text'>|Statue of Robert the Bruce at the [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn battle field]]]]'''Robert I''' (11 July 1274 ‚Äì 7 June 1329), popularly known as '''Robert the Bruce''' ([[Middle Irish language|Medieval Gaelic]]: ''Roibert a Briuis''; [[Scottish Gaelic|modern Scottish Gaelic]]: ''Raibeart Bruis''; [[Anglo-Norman language|Norman French]]: ''Robert de Brus'' or ''Robert de Bruys'', [[Early Scots]]: ''Robert Brus''), was [[King of Scots]] from 1306 until his death in 1329</span>
				<span class='text'>Robert was one of the most famous [[warrior]]s of his [[generation]], and eventually led Scotland during the first of the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] against [[Kingdom of England|England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He fought successfully during his reign to regain Scotland's place as an independent nation and is today remembered in Scotland as a national hero</span>
				<span class='text'>escended from the [[Anglo-Norman]] and [[Gaels|Gaelic]] [[Nobility|nobilities]], his paternal fourth-great grandfather was [[David I of Scotland|David I]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Robert‚Äôs grandfather, [[Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale]], was one of the claimants to the Scottish throne during the &quot;[[Great Cause]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>As [[Earl of Carrick]], Robert the Bruce supported his family‚Äôs claim to the throne and took part in [[William Wallace]]‚Äôs revolt against [[Edward I of England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1298, Bruce became a [[Guardian of Scotland]] alongside his great rival for the Scottish throne, [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|John Comyn]], and [[William Lamberton]], [[Bishop of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Andrews]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruce resigned as guardian in 1300 due in part to his quarrels with Comyn but chiefly because the restoration of King John seemed imminent</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1302, he submitted to Edward I and returned to &quot;the king‚Äôs peace&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>When his father died in 1304, Bruce inherited his family‚Äôs claim to the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>In February 1306, following an argument during a meeting at Greyfriars monastery, [[Dumfries]], Bruce killed Comyn</span>
				<span class='text'>He was [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by the [[Pope]] but [[Absolution|absolved]] by [[Robert Wishart]], [[Bishop of Glasgow]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ruce moved quickly to seize the throne and was crowned king of Scots on 25 March 1306, at [[Scone, Perthshire|Scone]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Edward I‚Äôs forces defeated Robert in battle, and Bruce was forced to flee into hiding in the [[Hebrides]] and [[Ireland]] before returning in 1307 to defeat an English army at [[Battle of Loudoun Hill|Loudoun Hill]] and wage a highly successful [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against the English</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruce defeated the Comyns and his other Scots enemies, destroying their strongholds and devastating their lands from [[Buchan]] to [[Galloway]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1309, he held his first [[Parliament of Scotland|parliament]] at [[St Andrews]], and a series of military victories between 1310 and 1314 won him control of much of Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>At the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in June 1314, Bruce defeated a much larger English army under [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], confirming the re-establishment of an independent Scottish monarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>The battle marked a significant turning point, and, freed from English threats, Scotland's armies could now invade [[northern England]];  Bruce launched devastating raids into [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also decided to expand his war against the English and create a second front by sending an army under his younger brother, [[Edward Bruce|Edward]], to invade [[Lordship of Ireland|Ireland]], appealing to the native Irish to rise against Edward II's rule</span>
				<span class='text'>espite Bannockburn and the capture of the final English stronghold at [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]] in 1318, Edward II refused to give up his claim to the overlordship of Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1320, the Scottish magnates and nobles submitted the [[Declaration of Arbroath]] to [[Pope John XXII]], declaring Bruce as their rightful monarch and asserting Scotland‚Äôs status as an independent kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1324, the Pope recognised Bruce as king of an independent Scotland, and in 1326, the [[Auld Alliance|Franco-Scottish alliance]] was renewed in the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1326)|Treaty of Corbeil]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1327, the English deposed Edward II in favour of his son, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], and peace was temporarily concluded between Scotland and England with the [[Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton]], by which Edward III renounced all claims to sovereignty over Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>obert the Bruce died on 7 June 1329</span>
				<span class='text'>His body is buried in [[Dunfermline Abbey]], while his heart was interred in [[Melrose Abbey]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruce's lieutenant and friend [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|Sir James Douglas]] agreed to take the late King's embalmed heart on crusade to the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Lord's Sepulchre]] in the [[Holy Land]], but he reached only as far as Moorish [[Granada]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Douglas was killed in battle during the siege of [[Battle of Teba|Teba]] while fulfilling his promise</span>
				<span class='text'>His body and the casket containing the embalmed heart were found upon the field</span>
				<span class='text'>They were both conveyed back to Scotland by [[Sir William Keith of Galston]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Very little is known of his youth</span>
				<span class='text'>He was probably brought up in a mixture of the [[Anglo-Norman]] culture of northern England and south-eastern Scotland, and the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] culture of south-west Scotland and most of Scotland north of the [[River Forth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Annandale]] was thoroughly [[Feudalism|feudalised]] and the form of Northern [[Middle English]] that would later develop into the [[Scots language]] was spoken throughout the region</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]] was historically an integral part of [[Galloway]], and though the earls of Carrick had achieved some feudalisation, the society of Carrick at the end of the thirteenth century remained emphatically [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] speaking</span>

				<span class='text'>34&lt;/ref&gt;Robert the Bruce would most probably have become trilingual at an early age</span>
				<span class='text'>He would have spoken both the Anglo-Norman language of his Scots-Norman peers and his father‚Äôs family, and the Gaelic language of his Carrick birthplace and his mother‚Äôs family</span>
				<span class='text'>He would also have spoken the early Scots language</span>

				<span class='text'>Robert had nine siblings, and he and his brother [[Edward Bruce|Edward]] may have been fostered according to Gaelic tradition, spending a substantial part of their youth at the courts of other noblemen (Robert‚Äôs foster-brother is referred to by Barbour as sharing Robert‚Äôs precarious existence as an outlaw in Carrick in 1307-08)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As heir, Robert would have been schooled by tutors in all the requirements of courtly etiquette, and he would have waited as a [[page (occupation)|page]] at his father‚Äôs and grandfather‚Äôs tables</span>
				<span class='text'>This grandfather, known to contemporaries as [[Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale|Robert the Noble]], and to history as &quot;Bruce the Competitor&quot; (because he competed with the other claimants to the throne of Scotland in the &quot;[[Great Cause]]&quot;) seems to have been an immense influence on the future king</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Macnamee, Robert Bruce p</span>
				<span class='text'>14&quot;/&gt;Robert's first appearance in history is on a witness list of a charter issued by [[Alexander Og MacDonald, Lord of Islay]]</span>

				<span class='text'>35&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Bruce, the king to be, was sixteen years of age when [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]] died in 1290</span>
				<span class='text'>It is also around this time that Robert would have been knighted, and he began to appear on the political stage in the Bruce dynastic interest</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Almost immediately, his grandfather, [[Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale]], resigned his Lordship of Annandale and his claim to the throne to Robert's father</span>
				<span class='text'>Days later that son, [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale]], resigned the earldom of Carrick he had held in right of his late wife to their son, Robert, the future king</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Barrow-86-88&quot;/&gt; This the Scottish king did, but the final straw was Edward's demand that the Scottish magnates provide military service in England's war against France</span>

				<span class='text'>The Bruces and the earls of [[Gilbert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus|Angus]] and [[Patrick IV, Earl of March|March]] refused, and the Bruce family withdrew temporarily from Scotland, while the Comyns seized their estates in Annandale and Carrick, granting them to [[John Comyn, Earl of Buchan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Macnamee, Robert Bruce p</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Drawing of Robert the Bruce and Isabella of Mar, from 1562]]Almost the first blow in the [[First War of Scottish Independence|war between Scotland and England]] was a direct attack on the Bruces</span>
				<span class='text'>On 26 March 1296, Easter Monday, seven Scottish earls made a surprise attack on the walled city of [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], which was not so much an attack against England as the Comyn Earl of Buchan and their faction attacking their Bruce enemies</span>

				<span class='text'>63&quot;/&gt; With the outbreak of the revolt, Robert left Carlisle and made his way to Annandale, where he called together the knights of his ancestral lands and, according to the English chronicler [[Walter of Guisborough]], addressed them thus:&lt;blockquote&gt;No man holds his own flesh and blood in hatred and I am no exception</span>

				<span class='text'>That Bruce was in the forefront of fomenting rebellion is shown in a letter written to Edward by [[Hugh Cressingham]] on 23 July 1292, which reports the opinion that &quot;if you had the earl of Carrick, the Steward of Scotland and his brother‚Ä¶you would think your business done&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; On 7 July, Bruce and his friends made terms with Edward by a treaty called the [[Capitulation of Irvine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Scottish lords were not to serve beyond the sea against their will and were pardoned for their recent violence in return for swearing allegiance to King Edward</span>
				<span class='text'>The Bishop of Glasgow, James the Steward, and Sir Alexander Lindsay became sureties for Bruce until he delivered his infant daughter [[Marjorie Bruce|Marjorie]] as a hostage, which he never did</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}</span>
				<span class='text'>hen King Edward returned to England after his victory at the [[Battle of Falkirk]], the Bruce's possessions were excepted from the Lordships and lands that Edward assigned to his followers</span>
				<span class='text'>The reason for this is uncertain, though Fordun records Robert fighting for Edward, at Falkirk, under the command of [[Antony Bek (bishop of Durham)|Antony Bek]], [[Bishop of Durham]], [[Annandale, Dumfries and Galloway|Annandale]] and [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This participation is contested as no Bruce appears on the [[Battle of Falkirk#The Falkirk Roll of Arms|Falkirk roll]] of nobles present in the English army, and two 19th Century antiquarians: Alexander Murison and George Chalmers have stated Bruce did not participate and in the following month decided to lay waste Annandale and burn Ayr Castle, to prevent it being garrisoned by the English</span>
				<span class='text'>[William Wallace]] resigned as [[Guardian of Scotland]] after his defeat at the [[Battle of Falkirk]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was succeeded by Robert Bruce and [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|John Comyn]] as joint Guardians, but they could not see past their personal differences</span>
				<span class='text'>As a nephew and supporter of King John, and as someone with a serious claim to the Scottish throne, Comyn was Bruce's enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1299, [[William Lamberton]], [[Bishop of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Andrews]], was appointed as a third, neutral Guardian to try to maintain order between Bruce and Comyn</span>
				<span class='text'>The following year, Bruce finally resigned as joint Guardian and was replaced by Sir [[Gilbert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1301, Umfraville, Comyn, and Lamberton also resigned as joint Guardians and were replaced by Sir [[John de Soules]] as sole Guardian</span>
				<span class='text'>Soules was appointed largely because he was part of neither the Bruce nor the Comyn camps and was a patriot</span>
				<span class='text'>He was an active Guardian and made renewed efforts to have King John returned to the Scottish throne</span>
				<span class='text'>n July 1301 King Edward I launched his sixth campaign into Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>Though he captured the castles of [[Bothwell Castle|Bothwell]] and [[Turnberry Castle|Turnberry]], he did little to damage the Scots' fighting ability, and in January 1302 he agreed to a nine-month truce</span>
				<span class='text'>It was around this time that Robert the Bruce submitted to Edward, along with other nobles, even though he had been on the side of the Scots until then</span>
				<span class='text'>There were rumours that [[John Balliol]] would return to regain the Scottish throne</span>
				<span class='text'>Soules, who had probably been appointed by John, supported his return, as did most other nobles</span>
				<span class='text'>But it was no more than a rumour and nothing came of it</span>
				<span class='text'>n March 1302 Bruce sent a letter to the monks at [[Melrose Abbey]] apologising for having called tenants of the monks to service in his army when there had been no national call-up</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruce pledged that, henceforth, he would &quot;never again&quot; require the monks to serve unless it was to &quot;the common army of the whole realm&quot;, for national defence</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruce also married his second wife that year, [[Elizabeth de Burgh]], the daughter of [[Richard de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By Elizabeth he had four children: [[David II of Scotland|David II]], John (died in childhood), Matilda (who married Thomas Isaac and died at Aberdeen 20 July 1353), and Margaret (who married [[William de Moravia, 5th Earl of Sutherland]] in 1345)</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1303, Edward invaded again, reaching [[Edinburgh]] before marching to [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Edward stayed in Perth until July, then proceeded via [[Dundee]], [[Brechin]], and [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] to [[Aberdeen]], where he arrived in August</span>
				<span class='text'>From there he marched through [[Moray]] to [[Badenoch]] before re-tracing his path back south to [[Dunfermline]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With the country now under submission, all the leading Scots, except for William Wallace, surrendered to Edward in February 1304</span>
				<span class='text'>John Comyn, who was by now Guardian, submitted to Edward</span>
				<span class='text'>The laws and liberties of Scotland were to be as they had been in the days of [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]], and any that needed alteration would be with the assent of King Edward and the advice of the Scots nobles</span>
				<span class='text'>n 11 June 1304, Bruce and William Lamberton made a pact that bound them, each to the other, in ‚Äúfriendship and alliance against all men</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù If one should break the secret pact, he would forfeit to the other the sum of ten thousand pounds</span>
				<span class='text'>The pact is often interpreted{{by whom|date=July 2015}} as a sign of their patriotism despite both having already surrendered to the English</span>
				<span class='text'>Homage was again obtained from the nobles and the burghs, and a parliament was held to elect those who would meet later in the year with the English parliament to establish rules for the governance of Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Earl of Richmond]], Edward's nephew, was to head up the subordinate government of Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>While all this took place, William Wallace was finally captured near [[Glasgow]], and he was hanged, drawn, and quartered in London on 23 August 1305</span>
				<span class='text'>n September 1305, Edward ordered Robert Bruce to put his [[Kildrummy Castle|castle at Kildrummy]], &quot;in the keeping of such a man as he himself will be willing to answer for,&quot; suggesting that King Edward suspected Robert was not entirely trustworthy and may have been plotting behind his back</span>
				<span class='text'>However, an identical phrase appears in an agreement between Edward and his lieutenant and lifelong friend, [[Aymer de Valence]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A further sign of Edward's distrust occurred on 10 October 1305, when Edward revoked his gift of Sir Gilbert de Umfraville's lands to Bruce that he had made only six months before</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Scott, Robert the Bruce, p</span>
				<span class='text'>72</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Robert Bruce as [[Earl of Carrick]], and now 7th [[Lord of Annandale]], held huge estates and property in Scotland and a barony and some minor properties in England, and a strong claim to the Scottish throne</span>
				<span class='text'>=Murder of John Comyn==[[Image:Death of Comyn</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|The killing of Comyn in the Greyfriars church in Dumfries, as imagined by [[Henri F√©lix Emmanuel Philippoteaux|Felix Philippoteaux]], a 19th-century illustrator</span>
				<span class='text'>]Bruce, like all his family, had a complete belief in his right to the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his actions of supporting alternately the English and Scottish armies had led to a great deal of distrust towards Bruce among the &quot;Community of the Realm of Scotland&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>His ambition was further thwarted by [[John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch|John Comyn]], who had been much more resolute in his opposition to the English</span>
				<span class='text'>Comyn was the most powerful noble in Scotland and was related to many more powerful nobles both within Scotland and England, including relatives that held the earldoms of Buchan, Mar, Ross, Fife, Angus, Dunbar, and Strathearn; the Lordships of Kilbride, Kirkintilloch, Lenzie, Bedrule, and Scraesburgh; and sheriffdoms in Banff, Dingwall, Wigtown, and Aberdeen</span>
				<span class='text'> He also had a powerful claim to the Scottish throne through his descent from [[Donald III of Scotland|Donald III]] on his father's side and [[David I of Scotland|David I]] on his mother's side</span>
				<span class='text'>Comyn was the nephew of [[John Balliol]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Barbour and Fordoun, in the late summer of 1305, in a secret agreement sworn, signed, and sealed, John Comyn agreed to forfeit his claim to the Scottish throne in favour of Robert Bruce upon receipt of the Bruce lands in Scotland should an uprising occur led by Bruce</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Fordun, ''Scotichronicon'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>330; Barbour, ''The Bruce'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>13</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Whether the details of the agreement with Comyn are correct or not, King Edward moved to arrest Bruce while Bruce was still at the English court</span>
				<span class='text'>Fortunately for Bruce, his friend, and Edward's son-in-law, [[Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer|Ralph de Monthermer]] learnt of Edward's intention and warned Bruce by sending him twelve pence and a pair of spurs</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruce took the hint,&lt;ref&gt;Ronald McNair Scott (1988)</span>
				<span class='text'>''Robert the Bruce, King of Scots''</span>
				<span class='text'>Canongate: p</span>
				<span class='text'>72</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and he and a squire fled the English court during the night</span>
				<span class='text'>They made their way quickly for Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Barbour, Comyn betrayed his agreement with Bruce to King Edward I, and when Bruce arranged a meeting for 10 February 1306 with Comyn in the Chapel of [[Franciscan|Greyfriars]] Monastery in [[Dumfries]] and accused him of treachery, they came to blows</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barbour, ''The Bruce'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>15</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Bruce assaulted Comyn in Dumfries before the high altar</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Scotichronicon]] says that on being told that Comyn had survived the attack and was being treated, two of Bruce's supporters, [[Roger de Kirkpatrick]] (uttering the words &quot;I mak siccar&quot; (&quot;I make sure&quot;)) and John Lindsay, went back into the church and finished Bruce's work</span>
				<span class='text'>Barbour, however, tells no such story</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruce asserted his claim to the Scottish crown and began his campaign by force for the independence of Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>ruce and his party then attacked Dumfries Castle where the English garrison surrendered</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruce hurried from Dumfries to Glasgow, where his friend and supporter Bishop Robert Wishart granted him absolution and subsequently adjured the clergy throughout the land to rally to Bruce</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Scott, ''Robert the Bruce'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>74</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Bruce was [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] for this crime</span>

				<span class='text'>They state that the Comyn murder was planned in an attempt to gain the throne of Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>For this reason King Edward of England wrote to the Pope and asked for his excommunication of Robert Bruce</span>
				<span class='text'>No records have ever been found in England stating that King Edward had any knowledge of treachery by Robert Bruce before his acts against Comyn</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|230px|Bruce crowned King of Scots; modern tableau at Edinburgh Castle]]Six weeks after Comyn was killed in Dumfries, Bruce was crowned King of Scots by [[Bishop William de Lamberton]] at [[Scone, Perthshire|Scone]], near [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], on 25 March 1306 with all formality and solemnity</span>
				<span class='text'>The royal robes and vestments that Robert Wishart had hidden from the English were brought out by the Bishop and set upon King Robert</span>
				<span class='text'>The bishops of Moray and Glasgow were in attendance as well as the earls of Atholl, Menteith, Lennox, and Mar</span>
				<span class='text'>The great banner of the kings of Scotland was planted behind his throne</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Scott, Robert the Bruce, p</span>
				<span class='text'>75</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan]] and wife of [[John Comyn, 3rd Earl of Buchan]] (a cousin of the murdered John Comyn) arrived the next day, too late for the coronation</span>
				<span class='text'>She claimed the right of her family, the MacDuff [[Earl of Fife]], to crown the Scottish king for her brother, [[Donnchadh IV, Earl of Fife]], who was not yet of age, and in English hands</span>
				<span class='text'>So a second coronation was held and once more the crown was placed on the brow of Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick, Lord of Annandale, [[King of the Scots]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n June 1306 Bruce was defeated at the [[Battle of Methven]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His wife and daughters and other women of the party were sent to Kildrummy in August 1306 under the protection of Bruce's brother Neil Bruce and the [[Earl of Atholl]] and most of his remaining men</span>

				<span class='text'>Bruce's queen, Elizabeth, his daughter [[Marjorie Bruce|Marjorie]], his sisters [[Christina Bruce|Christina]] and [[Mary Bruce|Mary]], and Isabella MacDuff were captured in a sanctuary at [[Tain]] and sent to harsh imprisonment, which included Mary and Isabella being hung in cages at [[Roxburgh Castle|Roxburgh]] and [[Berwick Castle|Berwick]] castles respectively for about four years, while Bruce's brother [[Nigel de Brus|Neil]] was executed by being hanged, drawn, and quartered</span>

				<span class='text'>Retrieved July 11, 2015</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On 7 July, King Edward I died, leaving Bruce opposed by the king's son, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>t is still uncertain where Bruce spent the winter of 1306‚Äì07</span>
				<span class='text'>Most likely he spent it in the [[Hebrides]], possibly sheltered by [[Christina of Garmoran]], who was married to Bruce's brother-in-law, Duncan, the brother of Bruce's first wife, Isabella of Mar</span>
				<span class='text'>Ireland is also a serious possibility, and [[Orkney]] (under Norwegian rule at the time) or Norway proper (where his sister [[Isabel Bruce]] was queen dowager) although unlikely are not impossible</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Traquair, Peter ''Freedom's Sword''&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce and his followers returned to the Scottish mainland in February in two groups</span>
				<span class='text'>One, led by Bruce and his brother [[Edward Bruce|Edward]] landed at [[Turnberry Castle]] and began a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] in south-west Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>The other, led by his brothers Thomas and Alexander, landed slightly further south in [[Loch Ryan]], but they were soon captured and executed</span>
				<span class='text'>In April, Bruce won a small victory over the English at the [[Battle of Glen Trool]], before defeating [[Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]], at the [[Battle of Loudoun Hill]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, James Douglas made his first foray for Bruce into south-western Scotland, attacking and burning his own castle in Douglasdale</span>
				<span class='text'>Leaving his brother Edward in command in [[Galloway]], Bruce travelled north, capturing [[Inverlochy Castle|Inverlochy]] and [[Urquhart Castle|Urquhart]] Castles, burning [[Inverness Castle]] and [[Nairn]] to the ground, then unsuccessfully threatening [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ransferring operations to [[Aberdeenshire (traditional)|Aberdeenshire]] in late 1307, he threatened [[Banff, Aberdeenshire|Banff]] before falling seriously ill, probably owing to the hardships of the lengthy campaign</span>
				<span class='text'>Recovering, leaving [[John Comyn, 3rd Earl of Buchan]] unsubdued at his rear, Bruce returned west to take [[Balvenie Castle|Balvenie]] and [[Duffus Castle|Duffus]] Castles, then Tarradale Castle on the [[Black Isle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Looping back via the hinterlands of Inverness and a second failed attempt to take Elgin, Bruce finally achieved his landmark defeat of Comyn at the [[Battle of Inverurie (1308)|Battle of Inverurie]] in May 1308; he then overran Buchan and defeated the English garrison at [[Aberdeen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Harrying of Buchan]] in 1308 was ordered by Bruce to make sure all Comyn family support was extinguished</span>
				<span class='text'>Buchan had a very large population because it was the agricultural capital of northern Scotland, and much of its population was loyal to the Comyn family even after the defeat of the Earl of Buchan</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of the Comyn castles in Moray, Aberdeen, and Buchan were destroyed and their inhabitants killed</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruce ordered similar harryings in Argyle and Kintyre, in the territories of [[Clan MacDougall]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With these acts, Bruce had successfully destroyed the power of the Comyns, which had controlled much of northern and southwestern Scotland for over a hundred and fifty years</span>
				<span class='text'>He then crossed to [[Argyll]] and defeated the MacDougalls (allies of the Comyns) at the [[Battle of Pass of Brander]] and took [[Dunstaffnage Castle]], the last major stronghold of the Comyns</span>

				<span class='text'>The following year, the clergy of Scotland recognised Bruce as king at a general council</span>
				<span class='text'>The support given to him by the church in spite of his excommunication was of great political importance</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the next three years, one English-held castle or outpost after another was captured and reduced: [[Linlithgow]] in 1310, [[Dumbarton]] in 1311, and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], by Bruce himself, in January 1312</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruce also made raids into northern England and, landing at Ramsey in the [[Isle of Man]], then laid siege to [[Castle Rushen]] in Castletown, capturing it on 21 June 1313 and denying the island's strategic importance to the English</span>
				<span class='text'>In the spring of 1314, [[Edward Bruce]] laid siege to Stirling Castle, whose governor, [[Philip de Mowbray]], agreed to capitulate if not relieved before 24 June 1314</span>
				<span class='text'>In March 1314, [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|James Douglas]] captured [[Roxburgh]], and [[Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray|Randolph]] captured [[Edinburgh Castle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In May, Bruce again raided England and subdued the Isle of Man</span>
				<span class='text'>he eight years of exhausting but deliberate refusal to meet the English on even ground have caused many to consider Bruce as one of the great guerrilla leaders of any age</span>
				<span class='text'>This represented a transformation for one raised as a [[knight|feudal knight]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Battle of Bannockburn==={{main|Battle of Bannockburn}}Bruce secured Scottish [[independence]] from England militarily ‚Äì if not diplomatically ‚Äì at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314</span>

				<span class='text'>=Further confrontation with England then the Irish conflict=={{main|Bruce campaign in Ireland}}Freed from English threats, Scotland's armies could now invade northern England</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruce also drove back a subsequent English expedition north of the border and launched raids into [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Buoyed by his military successes, Bruce's forces also invaded Ireland in 1315, purportedly to free the country from English rule (having received a reply to offers of assistance from Donal O'Neil, king of [[Tyrone]]), and to open a second front in the continuing wars with England</span>
				<span class='text'>The Irish even crowned Edward Bruce as [[High King of Ireland]] in 1316</span>
				<span class='text'>Robert later went there with another army to assist his brother</span>
				<span class='text'>n conjunction with the invasion, Bruce popularised an ideological vision of a &quot;Pan-Gaelic Greater Scotia&quot; with his lineage ruling over both Ireland and Scotland</span>
				<span class='text'>This propaganda campaign was aided by two factors</span>
				<span class='text'>The first was his marriage alliance from 1302 with the de Burgh family of the [[Earldom of Ulster]] in Ireland; second, Bruce himself, on his mother's side of Carrick, was descended from Gaelic royalty in Scotland as well as Ireland</span>
				<span class='text'>Bruce's Irish ancestors included [[Aoife MacMurrough|Eva of Leinster]] (d</span>
				<span class='text'>188), whose ancestors included [[Brian Boru]] of [[Munster]] and the [[List of Kings of Leinster|kings of Leinster]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, lineally and geopolitically, Bruce attempted to support his anticipated notion of a pan-Gaelic alliance between Scottish-Irish Gaelic populations, under his kingship</span>
				<span class='text'>This is revealed by a letter he sent to the Irish chiefs, where he calls the Scots and Irish collectively ''nostra nacio'' (our nation), stressing the common language, customs and heritage of the two peoples:{{quote|Whereas we and you and our people and your people, free since ancient times, share the same national ancestry and are urged to come together more eagerly and joyfully in friendship by a common language and by common custom, we have sent you our beloved kinsman, the bearers of this letter, to negotiate with you in our name about permanently strengthening and maintaining inviolate the special friendship between us and you, so that with God's will our nation (''nostra nacio'') may be able to recover her ancient liberty</span>
				<span class='text'>}The diplomacy worked to a certain extent, at least in Ulster, where the Scots had some support</span>
				<span class='text'>The Irish chief, Donal O'Neil, for instance, later justified his support for the Scots to [[Pope John XXII]] by saying &quot;the Kings of Lesser Scotia all trace their blood to our ''Greater Scotia'' and retain to some degree our language and customs</span>

				<span class='text'>46</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The Bruce campaign in Ireland was characterised by some initial military success</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the Scots failed to win over the non-Ulster chiefs or to make any other significant gains in the south of the island, where people couldn't see the difference between English and Scottish occupation</span>
				<span class='text'>Eventually it was defeated when Edward Bruce was killed at the [[Battle of Faughart]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Irish Annals of the period described the defeat of the Bruces by the English as one of the greatest things ever done for the Irish nation due to the fact it brought an end to the famine and pillaging wrought upon the Irish by both the Scots and the English</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The Annals of Connacht</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Diplomacy==The reign of Robert Bruce also included some significant diplomatic achievements</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Declaration of Arbroath]] of 1320 strengthened his position, particularly ''vis-√†-vis'' the [[Papacy]], and [[Pope John XXII]] eventually lifted Bruce's excommunication</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1328 King [[Edward III of England]] signed the [[Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton]], which recognised Scotland as an independent kingdom, and Bruce as its king</span>

				<span class='text'>=Legends==According to a legend, at some point while he was on the run during the winter of 1306‚Äì07, Bruce hid in a cave on [[Rathlin Island]] off the north coast of Ireland, where he observed a spider spinning a web, trying to make a connection from one area of the cave's roof to another</span>
				<span class='text'>It tried and failed twice, but began again and succeeded on the third attempt</span>
				<span class='text'>Inspired by this, Bruce returned to inflict a series of defeats on the English, thus winning him more supporters and eventual victory</span>
				<span class='text'>The story serves to illustrate the maxim: &quot;if at first you don't succeed, try try try again</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Other versions have Bruce in a small house watching the spider try to make its connection between two roof beams</span>
