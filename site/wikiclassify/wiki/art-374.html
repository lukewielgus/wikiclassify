				<span class='text'>k|r|…ëÀê|f|t}}; 27 April 1759&amp;nbsp;‚Äì 10 September 1797) was an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of [[women's rights]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During her brief career, she wrote novels, treatises, a [[travel literature|travel narrative]], a history of the [[French Revolution]], a [[conduct book]], and a children's book</span>
				<span class='text'>Wollstonecraft is best known for ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), in which she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education</span>
				<span class='text'>She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a [[social order]] founded on reason</span>
				<span class='text'>ntil the late 20th century, Wollstonecraft's life, which encompassed several unconventional personal relationships, received more attention than her writing</span>
				<span class='text'>After two ill-fated affairs, with [[Henry Fuseli]] and [[Gilbert Imlay]] (by whom she had a daughter, [[Fanny Imlay]]), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher [[William Godwin]], one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement</span>
				<span class='text'>Wollstonecraft died at the age of 38, eleven days after giving birth to her second daughter, leaving behind several unfinished manuscripts</span>
				<span class='text'>This daughter, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, became an accomplished writer herself, as [[Mary Shelley]], the author of ''[[Frankenstein]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>fter Wollstonecraft's death, her widower published a ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman|Memoir]]'' (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation for almost a century</span>
				<span class='text'>However, with the emergence of the [[feminist movement]] at the turn of the twentieth century, Wollstonecraft's advocacy of women's equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important</span>
				<span class='text'>Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding [[feminist philosophy|feminist philosophers]], and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences</span>
				<span class='text'>=Biography=====Early life===Wollstonecraft was born on 27 April 1759 in [[Spitalfields]], London</span>
				<span class='text'>She was the second of the seven children of Edward John Wollstonecraft and Elizabeth Dixon</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Feminist papers: from Adams to de Beauvoir|first=Alice S |last= Rossi | authorlink = Alice S</span>
				<span class='text'>Rossi |year= 1988|publisher=Northeastern|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although her family had a comfortable income when she was a child, her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently, the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecraft's youth</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 9, 17, 24, 27; Sunstein, 11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The family's financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecraft's father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages</span>
				<span class='text'>As a teenager, Wollstonecraft used to lie outside the door of her mother's bedroom to protect her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Todd, 11; Tomalin, 19; Wardle, 6; Sunstein, 16</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters, Everina and Eliza, throughout her life</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, in a defining moment in 1784, she convinced Eliza, who was suffering from what was probably [[postpartum depression]], to leave her husband and infant; Wollstonecraft made all of the arrangements for Eliza to flee, demonstrating her willingness to challenge social norms</span>
				<span class='text'>The human costs, however, were severe: her sister suffered social condemnation and, because she could not remarry, was doomed to a life of poverty and hard work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Todd, 45‚Äì57; Tomalin, 34‚Äì43; Wardle, 27‚Äì30; Sunstein, 80‚Äì91</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Two friendships shaped Wollstonecraft's early life</span>
				<span class='text'>The first was with [[Jane Gardiner|Jane Arden]] in [[Beverley]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The two frequently read books together and attended lectures presented by Arden's father, a self-styled philosopher and scientist</span>
				<span class='text'>Wollstonecraft revelled in the intellectual atmosphere of the Arden household and valued her friendship with Arden greatly, sometimes to the point of being emotionally possessive</span>
				<span class='text'>Wollstonecraft wrote to her: &quot;I have formed romantic notions of friendship&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I am a little singular in my thoughts of love and friendship; I must have the first place or none</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Todd, 16</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In some of Wollstonecraft's letters to Arden, she reveals the volatile and depressive emotions that would haunt her throughout her life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Todd, 72‚Äì75; Tomalin, 18‚Äì21; Sunstein, 22‚Äì33</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The second and more important friendship was with Fanny (Frances) Blood, introduced to Wollstonecraft by the Clares, a couple in [[Hoxton]] who became parental figures to her; Wollstonecraft credited Blood with opening her mind</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Todd, 22‚Äì24; Tomalin, 25‚Äì27; Wardle, 10‚Äì11; Sunstein, 39‚Äì42</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Unhappy with her home life, Wollstonecraft struck out on her own in 1778 and accepted a job as a [[lady's companion]] to Sarah Dawson, a widow living in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Wollstonecraft had trouble getting along with the irascible woman (an experience she drew on when describing the drawbacks of such a position in ''[[Thoughts on the Education of Daughters]]'', 1787)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1780 she returned home, called back to care for her dying mother</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wardle, 12‚Äì18; Sunstein 51‚Äì57</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Rather than return to Dawson's employ after the death of her mother, Wollstonecraft moved in with the Bloods</span>
				<span class='text'>She realized during the two years she spent with the family that she had idealized Blood, who was more invested in traditional feminine values than was Wollstonecraft</span>
				<span class='text'>But Wollstonecraft remained dedicated to her and her family throughout her life (she frequently gave pecuniary assistance to Blood's brother, for example)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wardle, 20; Sunstein, 73‚Äì76</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Wollstonecraft had envisioned living in a female utopia with Blood; they made plans to rent rooms together and support each other emotionally and financially, but this dream collapsed under economic realities</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to make a living, Wollstonecraft, her sisters, and Blood set up a school together in [[Newington Green]], a [[English dissenters|Dissenting]] community</span>
				<span class='text'>Blood soon became engaged and after their marriage her husband, Hugh Skeys, took her to [[Lisbon]], Portugal, to improve her health, which had always been precarious</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Todd, 62; Wardle, 30‚Äì32; Sunstein, 92‚Äì102</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Despite the change of surroundings Blood's health further deteriorated when she became pregnant, and in 1785 Wollstonecraft left the school and followed Blood to nurse her, but to no avail</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Todd, 68‚Äì69; Tomalin, 52ff; Wardle, 43‚Äì45; Sunstein, 103‚Äì106</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, her abandonment of the school led to its failure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 54‚Äì57</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Blood's death devastated Wollstonecraft and was part of the inspiration for her first novel, ''[[Mary: A Fiction]]'' (1788)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See Wardle, chapter 2, for autobiographical elements of ''Mary''; see Sunstein, chapter 7</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Mary Wollstonecraft in 1790‚Äì1, by [[John Opie]]]]After Blood's death, Wollstonecraft's friends helped her obtain a position as [[governess]] to the daughters of the [[Anglo-Irish]] Kingsborough family in Ireland</span>
				<span class='text'>Although she could not get along with Lady Kingsborough,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Todd, 106‚Äì7; Tomalin, 66; 79‚Äì80; Sunstein, 127‚Äì28</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; the children found her an inspiring instructor; [[Margaret King]] would later say she &quot;had freed her mind from all superstitions&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Todd, 116</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Some of Wollstonecraft's experiences during this year would make their way into her only children's book, ''[[Original Stories from Real Life]]'' (1788)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 64‚Äì88; Wardle, 60ff; Sunstein, 160‚Äì61</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Frustrated by the limited career options open to respectable yet poor women‚Äîan impediment which Wollstonecraft eloquently describes in the chapter of ''[[Thoughts on the Education of Daughters]]'' entitled &quot;Unfortunate Situation of Females, Fashionably Educated, and Left Without a Fortune&quot;‚Äîshe decided, after only a year as a governess, to embark upon a career as an author</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a radical choice, since, at the time, few women could support themselves by writing</span>
				<span class='text'>As she wrote to her sister Everina in 1787, she was trying to become &quot;the first of a new genus&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''The Collected Letters'', 139; see also Sunstein, 154</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She moved to London and, assisted by the liberal publisher [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]], found a place to live and work to support herself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Todd, 123; Tomalin, 91‚Äì92; Wardle, 80‚Äì82; Sunstein, 151‚Äì55</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She learned French and German and translated texts,&lt;ref&gt;Todd, 134‚Äì35</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; most notably ''Of the Importance of Religious Opinions'' by [[Jacques Necker]] and ''Elements of Morality, for the Use of Children'' by [[Christian Gotthilf Salzmann]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She also wrote reviews, primarily of novels, for Johnson's periodical, the ''[[Analytical Review]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Wollstonecraft's intellectual universe expanded during this time, not only from the reading that she did for her reviews but also from the company she kept: she attended Johnson's famous dinners and met such luminaries as the radical pamphleteer [[Thomas Paine]] and the philosopher [[William Godwin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The first time Godwin and Wollstonecraft met, they were both disappointed in each other</span>
				<span class='text'>Godwin had come to hear Paine, but Wollstonecraft assailed him all night long, disagreeing with him on nearly every subject</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson himself, however, became much more than a friend; she described him in her letters as a father and a brother</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 89‚Äì109; Wardle, 92‚Äì94; 128; Sunstein, 171‚Äì75</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;While in London, Wollstonecraft pursued a relationship with the artist [[Henry Fuseli]], even though he was already married</span>
				<span class='text'>She was, she wrote, enraptured by his genius, &quot;the grandeur of his soul, that quickness of comprehension, and lovely sympathy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Todd, 153</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She proposed a platonic living arrangement with Fuseli and his wife, but Fuseli's wife was appalled, and he broke off the relationship with Wollstonecraft</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Todd, 197‚Äì98; Tomalin 151‚Äì52; Wardle, 171‚Äì73; 76‚Äì77; Sunstein, 220‚Äì22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After Fuseli's rejection, Wollstonecraft decided to travel to France to escape the humiliation of the incident, and to participate in the revolutionary events that she had just celebrated in her recent ''[[Vindication of the Rights of Men]]'' (1790)</span>
				<span class='text'>She had written the ''Rights of Men'' in response to [[Edmund Burke]]'s conservative critique of the [[French Revolution]] in ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790) and it made her famous overnight</span>
				<span class='text'>She was compared with such leading lights as the theologian and controversialist [[Joseph Priestley]] and Paine, whose ''[[Rights of Man]]'' (1791) would prove to be the most popular of the responses to Burke</span>
				<span class='text'>She pursued the ideas she had outlined in ''Rights of Men'' in ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), her most famous and influential work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 144‚Äì155; Wardle, 115ff; Sunstein, 192‚Äì202</span>

				<span class='text'>[[10 August (French Revolution)|10 August]] attack on the [[Tuileries Palace]]; French revolutionary violence spreads]]Wollstonecraft left for Paris in December 1792 and arrived about a month before [[Execution of Louis XVI|Louis XVI was guillotined]]</span>
				<span class='text'>France was in turmoil</span>
				<span class='text'>She sought out other British visitors such as [[Helen Maria Williams]] and joined the circle of expatriates then in the city</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Todd, 214‚Äì15; Tomalin, 156‚Äì82; Wardle, 179‚Äì84</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Having just written the ''Rights of Woman'', Wollstonecraft was determined to put her ideas to the test, and in the stimulating intellectual atmosphere of the [[French revolution]] she attempted her most experimental romantic attachment yet: she met and fell passionately in love with [[Gilbert Imlay]], an American adventurer</span>
				<span class='text'>Whether or not she was interested in marriage, he was not, and she appears to have fallen in love with an idealized portrait of the man</span>
				<span class='text'>While Wollstonecraft had rejected the sexual component of relationships in the ''Rights of Woman'', Imlay awakened her passions and her interest in sex</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Todd, 232‚Äì36; Tomalin, 185‚Äì86; Wardle, 185‚Äì88; Sunstein, 235‚Äì45</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She soon became pregnant, and on 14 May 1794 she gave birth to her first child, [[Fanny Imlay|Fanny]], naming her after perhaps her closest friend</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 218; Wardle, 202‚Äì3; Sunstein, 256‚Äì57</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft was overjoyed; she wrote to a friend: &quot;My little Girl begins to suck so MANFULLY that her father reckons saucily on her writing the second part of the R[igh]ts of Woman&quot; (emphasis hers)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Qtd</span>
				<span class='text'>in Wardle, 202</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She continued to write avidly, despite not only her pregnancy and the burdens of being a new mother alone in a foreign country, but also the growing tumult of the French Revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>While at [[Le Havre]] in northern France, she wrote a history of the early revolution, ''An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution'', which was published in London in December 1794</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 211‚Äì219; Wardle, 206‚Äì14; Sunstein, 254‚Äì55</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;As the political situation worsened, Britain [[First Coalition|declared war]] on France, placing all British subjects in France in considerable danger</span>
				<span class='text'>To protect Wollstonecraft, Imlay registered her as his wife in 1793, even though they were not married</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;St Clair, 160; Wardle, 192‚Äì93; Sunstein, 262‚Äì63</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Some of her friends were not so lucky; many, like Thomas Paine, were arrested, and some were even guillotined</span>
				<span class='text'>(Wollstonecraft's sisters believed she had been imprisoned</span>
				<span class='text'> After she left France, she continued to refer to herself as &quot;Mrs Imlay&quot;, even to her sisters, in order to bestow legitimacy upon her child</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 225</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Imlay, unhappy with the domestic-minded and maternal Wollstonecraft, eventually left her</span>
				<span class='text'>He promised that he would return to Le Havre where she went to give birth to her child, but his delays in writing to her and his long absences convinced Wollstonecraft that he had found another woman</span>
				<span class='text'>Her letters to him are full of needy expostulations, explained by most critics as the expressions of a deeply depressed woman but by some as a result of her circumstances‚Äîalone with an infant in the middle of a revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Todd, Chapter 25; Tomalin, 220‚Äì31; Wardle, 215ff; Sunstein, 262ff</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===England and William Godwin===Seeking Imlay, Wollstonecraft returned to London in April 1795, but he rejected her</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1795 she attempted to commit suicide, probably with [[laudanum]], but Imlay saved her life (although it is unclear how)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Todd, 286‚Äì87; Wardle, 225</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In a last attempt to win back Imlay, she embarked upon some business negotiations for him in Scandinavia, trying to recoup some of his losses</span>
				<span class='text'>Wollstonecraft undertook this hazardous trip with only her young daughter and a maid</span>
				<span class='text'>She recounted her travels and thoughts in letters to Imlay, many of which were eventually published as ''[[Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark|Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark]]'' in 1796</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 225‚Äì31; Wardle, 226‚Äì44; Sunstein, 277‚Äì90</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When she returned to England and came to the full realisation that her relationship with Imlay was over, she attempted suicide for the second time, leaving a note for Imlay:{{quote|Let my wrongs sleep with me! Soon, very soon, I shall be at peace</span>
				<span class='text'>When you receive this, my burning head will be cold&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I shall plunge into the Thames where there is least chance of my being snatched from the death I seek</span>
				<span class='text'>God bless you! May you never know by experience what you have made me endure</span>
				<span class='text'>Should your sensibility ever awake, remorse will find its way to your heart; and, in the midst of business and sensual pleasure, I shall appear before you, the victim of your deviation from rectitude</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Todd, 355‚Äì56; Tomalin, 232‚Äì36; Wardle, 245‚Äì46</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft considered her suicide attempt deeply rational, writing after her rescue, &lt;blockquote&gt;I have only to lament, that, when the bitterness of death was past, I was inhumanly brought back to life and misery</span>
				<span class='text'>But a fixed determination is not to be baffled by disappointment; nor will I allow that to be a frantic attempt, which was one of the calmest acts of reason</span>
				<span class='text'>In this respect, I am only accountable to myself</span>
				<span class='text'>Did I care for what is termed reputation, it is by other circumstances that I should be dishonoured</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Todd, 357</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Gradually, Wollstonecraft returned to her literary life, becoming involved with [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson's]] circle again, in particular with [[Mary Hays]], [[Elizabeth Inchbald]], and [[Sarah Siddons]] through [[William Godwin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Godwin and Wollstonecraft's unique courtship began slowly, but it eventually became a passionate love affair</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Godwin had read her ''Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark'' and later wrote that &quot;If ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book</span>
				<span class='text'>She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, at the same time that she displays a genius which commands all our admiration</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Godwin95&quot;/&gt; Once Wollstonecraft became pregnant, they decided to marry so that their child would be legitimate</span>
				<span class='text'>Their marriage revealed the fact that Wollstonecraft had never been married to Imlay, and as a result she and Godwin lost many friends</span>
				<span class='text'>Godwin received further criticism because he had advocated the abolition of marriage in his philosophical treatise ''[[Political Justice]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>Her own writings also addressed the topic</span>
				<span class='text'>In both her [[conduct book]] ''Thoughts on the Education of Daughters'' (1787) and her [[children's literature|children's book]] ''Original Stories from Real Life'' (1788), Wollstonecraft advocates educating children into the emerging middle-class ethos: self-discipline, honesty, frugality, and social contentment</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Both texts also advocate the education of women, a controversial topic at the time and one which she would return to throughout her career, most notably in ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>Hers was the first response in a pamphlet war that subsequently became known as the ''[[Revolution Controversy]]'', in which [[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[Rights of Man]]'' (1792) became the rallying cry for reformers and radicals</span>
				<span class='text'>ollstonecraft attacked not only monarchy and hereditary privilege but also the language that Burke used to defend and elevate it</span>
				<span class='text'>In a famous passage in the ''Reflections'', Burke had lamented: &quot;I had thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Marie Antoinette]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; with insult</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Qtd</span>
				<span class='text'>in Butler, 44</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Most of Burke's detractors deplored what they viewed as theatrical pity for the French queen‚Äîa pity they felt was at the expense of the people</span>
				<span class='text'>Wollstonecraft was unique in her attack on Burke's gendered language</span>
				<span class='text'>By redefining the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and the beautiful, terms first established by Burke himself in ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' (1756), she undermined his rhetoric as well as his argument</span>
				<span class='text'>Burke had associated the beautiful with weakness and femininity and the sublime with strength and masculinity; Wollstonecraft turns these definitions against him, arguing that his theatrical ''tableaux'' turn Burke's readers‚Äîthe citizens‚Äîinto weak women who are swayed by show</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar [[Claudia L</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson (scholar)|Claudia L</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson]] argues remains unsurpassed in its argumentative force,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 27; see also, Todd, 165</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's defence of an unequal society founded on the passivity of women</span>
				<span class='text'>n her arguments for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos in opposition to what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sapiro, 83; Kelly, 94‚Äì95; Todd, 164</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers, she believed in progress and derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom</span>
				<span class='text'>She argues for rationality, pointing out that Burke's system would lead to the continuation of [[slavery]], simply because it had been an ancestral tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 44</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She describes an idyllic country life in which each family can have a farm that will just suit its needs</span>
				<span class='text'>Wollstonecraft contrasts her [[utopia]]n picture of society, drawn with what she says is genuine feeling, to Burke's false feeling</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones, &quot;Political tradition&quot;, 44‚Äì46; Sapiro, 216</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The ''Rights of Men'' was Wollstonecraft's first overtly political work, as well as her first feminist work; as Johnson contends, &quot;it seems that in the act of writing the later portions of ''Rights of Men'' she discovered the subject that would preoccupy her for the rest of her career&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 29</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Instead of viewing women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage, Wollstonecraft maintains that they are human beings deserving of the same fundamental rights as men</span>
				<span class='text'>Large sections of the ''Rights of Woman'' respond vitriolically to [[conduct book]] writers such as [[James Fordyce]] and [[John Gregory (moralist)|John Gregory]] and educational philosophers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who wanted to deny women an education</span>
				<span class='text'>(Rousseau famously argues in ''[[Emile: Or, On Education|√âmile]]'' (1762) that women should be educated for the pleasure of men</span>

				<span class='text'>BY MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT</span>
				<span class='text'>PRINTED AT BOSTON, BY PETER EDES FOR THOMAS AND ANDREWS, Faust's Statue, No</span>
				<span class='text'>45, Newbury-Street, MDCCXCII</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;|Title page from the first American edition of ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792)]]Wollstonecraft states that currently many women are silly and superficial (she refers to them, for example, as &quot;spaniels&quot; and &quot;toys&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 144</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;), but argues that this is not because of an innate deficiency of mind but rather because men have denied them access to education</span>
				<span class='text'>Wollstonecraft is intent on illustrating the limitations that women's deficient educations have placed on them; she writes: &quot;Taught from their infancy that beauty is woman's sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 157</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She implies that, without the encouragement young women receive from an early age to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, women could achieve much more</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 124‚Äì26; Taylor, 14‚Äì15</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;While Wollstonecraft does call for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life, such as morality, she does not explicitly state that men and women are equal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See, for example Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 126, 146</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; What she does claim is that men and women are equal in the eyes of God</span>
				<span class='text'>However, such claims of equality stand in contrast to her statements respecting the superiority of masculine strength and valour</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 110</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Wollstonecraft famously and ambiguously writes: &quot;Let it not be concluded that I wish to invert the order of things; I have already granted, that, from the constitution of their bodies, men seem to be designed by Providence to attain a greater degree of virtue</span>
				<span class='text'>I speak collectively of the whole sex; but I see not the shadow of a reason to conclude that their virtues should differ in respect to their nature</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, how can they, if virtue has only one eternal standard? I must therefore, if I reason consequently, as strenuously maintain that they have the same simple direction, as that there is a God</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 135</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Her ambiguous statements regarding the equality of the sexes have since made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist, particularly since the word and the concept were unavailable to her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The words ''feminist'' and ''feminism'' did not come into existence until the 1890s</span>
				<span class='text'>''Oxford English Dictionary''</span>
				<span class='text'>Retrieved 17 September 2007; see Taylor, 12; 55‚Äì57; 105‚Äì106; 118‚Äì20; Sapiro, 257‚Äì59</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;One of Wollstonecraft's most scathing critiques in the ''Rights of Woman'' is of false and excessive [[sensibility]], particularly in women</span>
				<span class='text'>She argues that women who succumb to sensibility are &quot;blown about by every momentary gust of feeling&quot; and because they are &quot;the prey of their senses&quot; they cannot think rationally</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 177</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In fact, she claims, they do harm not only to themselves but to the entire civilization: these are not women who can help refine a civilization‚Äîa popular eighteenth-century idea‚Äîbut women who will destroy it</span>
				<span class='text'>Wollstonecraft does not argue that reason and feeling should act independently of each other; rather, she believes that they should inform each other</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones, 46</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In addition to her larger philosophical arguments, Wollstonecraft also lays out a specific educational plan</span>
				<span class='text'>In the twelfth chapter of the ''Rights of Woman'', &quot;On National Education&quot;, she argues that all children should be sent to a &quot;country day school&quot; as well as given some education at home &quot;to inspire a love of home and domestic pleasures</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; She also maintains that schooling should be [[coeducation|co-educational]], arguing that men and women, whose marriages are &quot;the cement of society&quot;, should be &quot;educated after the same model</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', Chapter 12; see also Kelly, 124‚Äì25; 133‚Äì34; Sapiro, 237ff</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Wollstonecraft addresses her text to the middle-class, which she describes as the &quot;most natural state&quot;, and in many ways the ''Rights of Woman'' is inflected by a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] view of the world</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 128ff; Taylor, 167‚Äì68; Sapiro, 27</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It encourages [[modesty]] and industry in its readers and attacks the uselessness of the aristocracy</span>
				<span class='text'>But Wollstonecraft is not necessarily a friend to the poor; for example, in her national plan for education, she suggests that, after the age of nine, the poor, except for those who are brilliant, should be separated from the rich and taught in another school</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Vindications'', 311; see also Taylor, 159‚Äì61; Sapiro, 91‚Äì92</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Novels===[[File:Otto Scholderer Lesendes M√§dchen</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|alt=Portrait of a girl reading a book with her shoulder and back exposed painted in a brown palette</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Otto Scholderer]]'s ''Young Girl Reading'' (1883); in both ''Mary'' and ''The Wrongs of Woman'', Wollstonecraft criticizes women who imagine themselves as sentimental heroines</span>
				<span class='text'>]{{Main|Mary: A Fiction|Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman}}Both of Wollstonecraft's novels criticize what she viewed as the [[wikt:patriarchal|patriarchal]] institution of marriage and its deleterious effects on women</span>
				<span class='text'>In her first novel, ''Mary: A Fiction'' (1788), the eponymous heroine is forced into a loveless marriage for economic reasons; she fulfils her desire for love and affection outside of marriage with two passionate [[romantic friendship]]s, one with a woman and one with a man</span>
				<span class='text'>''Maria: or, The Wrongs of Woman'' (1798), an unfinished novel published posthumously and often considered Wollstonecraft's most radical feminist work,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Chapter 9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; revolves around the story of a woman imprisoned in an insane asylum by her husband; like Mary, Maria also finds fulfilment outside of marriage, in an affair with a fellow inmate and a friendship with one of her keepers</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither of Wollstonecraft's novels depict successful marriages, although she posits such relationships in the ''Rights of Woman''</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of ''Mary'', the heroine believes she is going &quot;to that world where there is neither marrying, nor giving in marriage&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Wollstonecraft, ''Mary'', 68</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; presumably a positive state of affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Poovey, 100‚Äì101; Taylor, 232‚Äì33</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also critique the discourse of [[sensibility]], a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular at the end of the eighteenth century</span>
				<span class='text'>''Mary'' is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''The Wrongs of Woman'' the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 60; 65‚Äì66; Kelly, 44; Poovey, 89; Taylor, 135; Todd, ''Women's Friendship'', 210‚Äì11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Female friendships are central to both of Wollstonecraft's novels, but it is the friendship between Maria and Jemima, the servant charged with watching over her in the insane asylum, that is the most historically significant</span>
				<span class='text'>This friendship, based on a sympathetic bond of motherhood, between an upper-class woman and a lower-class woman is one of the first moments in the history of feminist literature that hints at a cross-class argument, that is, that women of different economic positions have the same interests because they are women</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Todd, ''Women's Friendship'', 208, 221‚Äì22; Johnson, 67‚Äì68; Taylor, 233; 243‚Äì44; Sapiro, 155</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===''Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark'' (1796)==={{Main|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark}}Wollstonecraft's ''Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark'' is a deeply personal [[travel literature|travel narrative]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The twenty-five letters cover a wide range of topics, from sociological reflections on Scandinavia and its peoples to philosophical questions regarding identity to musings on her relationship with [[Gilbert Imlay|Imlay]] (although he is not referred to by name in the text)</span>
				<span class='text'>Using the rhetoric of the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], Wollstonecraft explores the relationship between the self and society</span>
				<span class='text'>Reflecting the strong influence of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], ''Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark'' shares the themes of the French philosopher's ''[[Reveries of a Solitary Walker]]'' (1782): &quot;the search for the source of human happiness, the stoic rejection of material goods, the ecstatic embrace of nature, and the essential role of sentiment in understanding&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Favret, 104; Sapiro, 286‚Äì87</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; While Rousseau ultimately rejects society, however, Wollstonecraft celebrates domestic scenes and industrial progress in her text</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Favret, 105‚Äì106</span>

				<span class='text'>]Wollstonecraft promotes subjective experience, particularly in relation to nature, exploring the connections between the sublime and [[sensibility]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the letters describe the breathtaking scenery of Scandinavia and Wollstonecraft's desire to create an emotional connection to that natural world</span>
				<span class='text'>In so doing, she gives greater value to the imagination than she had in previous works</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In a change from her earlier works, however, she illustrates the detrimental effects of commerce on society, contrasting the imaginative connection to the world with a commercial and mercenary one, an attitude she associates with Imlay</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Favret, 119ff; Poovey, 93; Myers, &quot;Wollstonecraft's ''Letters''&quot;, 177; Kelly, 179‚Äì181</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;''Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark'' was Wollstonecraft's most popular book in the 1790s</span>
				<span class='text'>It sold well and was reviewed positively by most critics</span>
