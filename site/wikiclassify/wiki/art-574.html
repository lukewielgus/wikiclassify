				<span class='text'> In a career lasting over sixty years, he served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] four separate times (1868–74, 1880–85, February–July 1886 and 1892–94), more than any other person, and served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] four times</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone was also Britain's oldest Prime Minister; he resigned for the final time when he was 84 years old</span>
				<span class='text'>ladstone first entered Parliament in 1832</span>
				<span class='text'>Beginning as a [[High Tory]], Gladstone served in the Cabinet of [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]]</span>
				<span class='text'> After the split of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] Gladstone was a [[Peelite]]&amp;nbsp;– in 1859 the Peelites merged with the Whigs and the Radicals to form the Liberal Party</span>
				<span class='text'> As Chancellor Gladstone became committed to low public spending and to electoral reform, earning him the sobriquet &quot;The People's William&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>ladstone's first ministry saw many reforms including Disestablishment of the [[Church of Ireland]] and the introduction of [[Ballot Act 1872|secret voting]]</span>
				<span class='text'> After his electoral defeat in 1874, Gladstone resigned as leader of the Liberal Party, but from 1876 began a comeback based on opposition to [[April Uprising|Turkey's Bulgarian atrocities]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone's [[Midlothian Campaign]] of 1879–80 was an early example of many modern political campaigning techniques</span>
				<span class='text'>After the [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|1880 election]], he formed his second ministry, which saw crises in Egypt (culminating in the death of [[Charles George Gordon|General Gordon]] in 1885), and in Ireland, where the government passed repressive measures but also improved the legal rights of Irish tenant farmers</span>
				<span class='text'>The government also passed the [[Reform Act 1884|Third Reform Act]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ack in office in early 1886, Gladstone proposed Irish [[home rule]] but this was defeated in the House of Commons in July</span>
				<span class='text'>The resulting split in the Liberal Party helped keep them out of office, with one short break, for twenty years</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1892 Gladstone formed his last government at the age of 82</span>
				<span class='text'>The Second Irish Home Rule Bill passed the Commons but was defeated in the Lords in 1893</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone resigned in March 1894, in opposition to increased naval expenditure</span>
				<span class='text'>He left Parliament in 1895 and died three years later aged 88</span>
				<span class='text'>ladstone is famous for his oratory, his religiosity, his liberalism, his rivalry with the Conservative Leader [[Benjamin Disraeli]], and for his poor relations with [[Queen Victoria]], who once complained, &quot;He always addresses me as if I were a public meeting</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Shannon&gt;Shannon, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; One of his earliest childhood memories was being made to stand on a table and say &quot;Ladies and gentlemen&quot; to the assembled audience, probably at a gathering to promote the election of [[George Canning]] as MP for Liverpool in 1812</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1814 young &quot;Willy&quot; visited [[Scotland]] for the first time, as he and his brother [[John Neilson Gladstone|John]] travelled with their father to [[Edinburgh]], [[Biggar, South Lanarkshire|Biggar]] and [[Dingwall]] to visit their relatives</span>

				<span class='text'>Although Gladstone entered [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1833, with a view to becoming a [[barrister]], by 1839 he had requested that his name should be removed from the list because he no longer intended to be called to [[Call to the Bar|the Bar]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In September 1842 he lost the [[forefinger]] of his left hand in an accident while reloading a gun; thereafter he wore a glove or finger sheath (stall)</span>
				<span class='text'>In the second ministry of Robert Peel he served as [[President of the Board of Trade]] (1843–45)</span>
				<span class='text'>ladstone became concerned with the situation of &quot;coal whippers&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>These were the men who worked on London docks, &quot;whipping&quot; in baskets from ships to barges or wharves all incoming coal from the sea</span>
				<span class='text'>They were called up and relieved through public-houses and therefore a man could not get this job unless he possessed the favourable opinion of the publican, who looked upon most favourably those who drank</span>
				<span class='text'>The man's name was written down and the &quot;score&quot; followed</span>
				<span class='text'>Publicans issued employment solely on the capacity of the man to pay, and men often left the pub to work drunk</span>
				<span class='text'>They spent their savings on drink to secure the favourable opinion of publicans and therefore further employment</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone passed the Coal Vendors Act 1843 to set up a central office for employment</span>
				<span class='text'>When this Act expired in 1856 a Select Committee was appointed by the Lords in 1857 to look into the question</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone gave evidence to the Committee: &quot;I approached the subject in the first instance as I think everyone in Parliament of necessity did, with the strongest possible prejudice against the proposal [to interfere]; but the facts stated were of so extraordinary and deplorable a character, that it was impossible to withhold attention from them</span>
				<span class='text'>Then the question being whether legislative interference was required I was at length induced to look at a remedy of an extraordinary character as the only one I thought applicable to the case</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>t was a great innovation&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;He resigned in 1845 over the [[Maynooth Seminary]] issue, a matter of conscience for him</span>
				<span class='text'>To improve relations with Irish Catholics, Peel's government proposed increasing the annual grant paid to the Seminary for training Catholic priests</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone, who previously argued in a book that a [[Protestant]] country should not pay money to other churches, supported the increase in the Maynooth grant and voted for it in Commons, but resigned rather than face charges that he had compromised his principles to remain in office</span>
				<span class='text'>After accepting Gladstone's resignation, Peel confessed to a friend, &quot;I really have great difficulty sometimes in exactly comprehending what he means</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;As such, he had to stand for re-election, but the strong protectionism of the Duke of Newcastle, his patron in Newark, meant that he could not stand there and no other seat was available</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the corn law crisis of 1846, therefore, Gladstone was in the highly anomalous and possibly unique position of being a secretary of state without a seat in either house and thus unanswerable to parliament</span>

				<span class='text'>After Peel's death in 1850 Gladstone emerged as the leader of the [[Peelites]] in the House of Commons</span>
				<span class='text'>He was re-elected for the [[Oxford University (UK Parliament constituency)|University of Oxford]] (i</span>

				<span class='text'>Gladstone became a constant critic of [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Clarify|date=June 2010}}In 1847 Gladstone helped to establish [[Glenalmond College]], then The Holy and Undivided Trinity College at Glenalmond</span>
				<span class='text'>The school was set up as an episcopal foundation to spread the ideas of the Anglican Church in Scotland, and to educate the sons of the gentry</span>
				<span class='text'>s a young man Gladstone had treated his father's estate, Fasque, in [[Forfarshire]], southwest of Aberdeen, as home, but as a younger son he would not inherit it</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, from the time of his marriage, he lived at his wife's family's estate at [[Hawarden]] in [[Flintshire]], Wales</span>
				<span class='text'>He never actually owned Hawarden, which belonged first to his brother-in-law Sir Stephen Glynne, and was then inherited by Gladstone's eldest son in 1874</span>
				<span class='text'>During the late 1840s, when he was out of office, he worked extensively to turn Hawarden into a viable business</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1848 he also founded the Church Penitentiary Association for the Reclamation of Fallen Women</span>
				<span class='text'>In May 1849 he began his most active &quot;rescue work&quot; with &quot;[[fallen women]]&quot; and met prostitutes late at night on the street, in his house or in their houses, writing their names in a private notebook</span>
				<span class='text'>He aided the [[House of Mercy]] at [[Clewer]] near [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] (which exercised extreme in-house discipline) and spent much time arranging employment for ex-prostitutes</span>
				<span class='text'>In a &quot;Declaration&quot; signed on 7 December 1896 and only to be opened after his death by his son Stephen, Gladstone wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;With reference to rumours which I believe were at one time afloat, though I know not with what degree of currency: and also with reference to the times when I shall not be here to answer for myself, I desire to record my solemn declaration and assurance, as in the sight of God and before His Judgment Seat, that at no period of my life have I been guilty of the act which is known as that of infidelity to the marriage bed</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Gladstone wanted to maintain a balance between direct and indirect taxation</span>
				<span class='text'>He also wished to abolish the income tax</span>
				<span class='text'>He knew that its abolition depended on a considerable [[retrenchment]] in government expenditure</span>
				<span class='text'>He therefore increased the number of people eligible to pay it by lowering the threshold from £150 to £100</span>
				<span class='text'>The more people who paid income tax, Gladstone believed, the more the public would pressure the government into abolishing it</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Matthew, p</span>
				<span class='text'>127&quot;/&gt;The budget speech (delivered on 18 April), at nearly five hours length, raised Gladstone &quot;at once to the front rank of financiers as of orators&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>by universal consent it was one of the grandest displays and most able financial statement that ever was heard in the House of Commons; a great scheme, boldly, skilfully, and honestly devised, disdaining popular clamour and pressure from without, and the execution of it absolute perfection</span>
				<span class='text'>Even those who do not admire the Budget, or who are injured by it, admit the merit of the performance</span>
				<span class='text'>It has raised Gladstone to a great political elevation, and, what is of far greater consequence than the measure itself, has given the country assurance of a man equal to great political necessities, and fit to lead parties and direct governments</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Buxton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>109</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, with Britain entering the [[Crimean War]] in February 1854, Gladstone introduced his second budget on 6 March</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone had to increase expenditure on the Services and a vote of credit of £1,250,000 was taken to send a 25,000 strong force to the East</span>
				<span class='text'>The deficit for the year would be £2,840,000 (estimated revenue £56,680,000; estimated expenditure £59,420,000)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Buxton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>150</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Gladstone refused to borrow the money needed to rectify this deficit and instead increased the income tax by one half from sevenpence to tenpence-halfpenny in the pound (From ≈2</span>
				<span class='text'>2% to ≈4</span>
				<span class='text'>8%)</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone proclaimed that &quot;the expenses of a war are the moral check which it has pleased the Almighty to impose on the ambition and the lust of conquest that are inherent in so many nations&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Buxton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>151</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By May £6,870,000 was needed to finance the war and so Gladstone introduced another budget on 8 May</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone raised the income tax from 10 and a half pence to 14d</span>
				<span class='text'>to raise £3,250,000; spirits, malt, and sugar were taxed to raise the rest of the money needed</span>

				<span class='text'>ladstone inherited an unpleasant financial situation, with a deficit of nearly five millions and the income tax at 5d</span>
				<span class='text'>Like Peel, Gladstone dismissed the idea of borrowing to cover the deficit</span>

				<span class='text'>Usually not more than two-thirds of a tax imposed could be collected in a financial year so Gladstone therefore imposed the extra four pence at a rate of 8d</span>
				<span class='text'>during the first half of the year so that he could obtain the additional revenue in one year</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone's dividing line set up in 1853 had been abolished in 1858 but Gladstone revived it, with lower incomes to pay 6½d</span>

				<span class='text'>This budget &quot;marked the final adoption of the Free Trade principle, that taxation should be levied for Revenue purposes alone, and that every protective, differential, or discriminating duty </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>should be dislodged&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Buxton, p</span>
				<span class='text'>195</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 1859, there were 419 duties in existence</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1860 budget reduced the number of duties to 48, with 15 duties constituting the majority of the revenue</span>
				<span class='text'>To finance these reductions in indirect taxation, the income tax, instead of being abolished, was raised to 10d</span>
				<span class='text'>for incomes above £150 and at 7d</span>
				<span class='text'>for incomes above £100</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Reid, p</span>
				<span class='text'>421</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Some of the duties Gladstone intended to abolish in 1860 were the duties on paper, a controversial policy because the duties had traditionally inflated the costs of publishing and thus hindered the dissemination of radical working-class ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Palmerston supported continuation of the duties, using them and income tax revenues to make armament purchases, a majority of his Cabinet supported Gladstone</span>
				<span class='text'>The Bill to abolish duties on paper narrowly passed Commons but was rejected by the House of Lords</span>
				<span class='text'>As no [[money bill]] had been rejected by Lords for over two hundred years, a furore arose over this vote</span>
				<span class='text'>The next year, Gladstone included the abolition of paper duties in a consolidated [[Finance Bill]] (the first ever) to force the Lords to accept it, and accept it they did</span>
				<span class='text'>The proposal in the Commons of one bill only per session for the national finances was a precedent uniformly followed from that date until 1910, and it has been ever since the rule</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Gladstone believed that government was extravagant and wasteful with taxpayers' money and so sought to let money &quot;fructify in the pockets of the people&quot; by keeping taxation levels down through &quot;peace and retrenchment&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone wrote in 1859 to his brother who was a member of the Financial Reform Association at Liverpool: &quot;Economy is the first and great article (economy such as I understand it)  in my financial creed</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He wrote to his wife on 14 January 1860: &quot;I am ''certain'', from experience, of the immense advantage of strict account-keeping in early life</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The Austrian economist, [[Joseph Schumpeter]], described Gladstonian finance in his ''History of Economic Analysis'':&lt;blockquote&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>there was one man who not only united high ability with unparalleled opportunity but also knew how to turn budgets into political triumphs and who stands in history as the greatest English financier of economic liberalism, Gladstone</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The greatest feature of Gladstonian finance </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>was that it expressed with ideal adequacy both the whole civilisation and the needs of the time, ''ex visu'' of the conditions of the country to which it was to apply; or, to put it slightly differently, that it translated a social, political, and economic vision, which was comprehensive as well as historically correct, into the clauses of a set of co-ordinated fiscal measures</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstonian finance was the finance of the system of 'natural liberty,' laissez-faire, and free trade </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the most important thing was to remove fiscal obstructions to private activity</span>
				<span class='text'>And for this, in turn, it was necessary to keep public expenditure low</span>
				<span class='text'>Retrenchment was the victorious slogan of the day </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>it means the reduction of the functions of the state to a minimum </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>retrenchment means rationalisation of the remaining functions of the state, which among other things implies as small a military establishment as possible</span>
				<span class='text'>The resulting economic development would in addition, so it was believed, make social expenditures largely superfluous</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Equally important was it </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>to raise the revenue that would still have to be raised in such a way as to deflect economic behaviour as little as possible from what it would have been in the absence of all taxation ('taxation for revenue only')</span>
				<span class='text'>And since the profit motive and the propensity to save were considered of paramount importance for the economic progress of ''all'' classes, this meant in particular that taxation should as little as possible interfere with the net earnings of business</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>As regards indirect taxes, the principle of least interference was interpreted by Gladstone to mean that taxation should be concentrated on a few important articles, leaving the rest free</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Last, but not least, we have the principle of the balanced budget</span>

				<span class='text'>402–405</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Due to his actions as Chancellor, Gladstone earned the reputation as the liberator of British trade and the working man's breakfast table, the man responsible for the emancipation of the popular press from &quot;taxes upon knowledge&quot; and for placing a duty on the succession of the estates of the rich</span>

				<span class='text'>139</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Gladstone's popularity rested on his taxation policies which meant to his supporters balance, social equity and political justice</span>

				<span class='text'>140–141</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The most significant expression of working-class opinion was at Northumberland in 1862 when Gladstone visited</span>
				<span class='text'>[[George Holyoake]] recalled in 1865:&lt;blockquote&gt;When Mr Gladstone visited the North, you well remember when word passed from the newspaper to the workman that it circulated through mines and mills, factories and workshops, and they came out to greet the only British minister who ever gave the English people a right because it was just they should have it </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and when he went down the Tyne, all the country heard how twenty miles of banks were lined with people who came to greet him</span>
				<span class='text'>Men stood in the blaze of chimneys; the roofs of factories were crowded; colliers came up from the mines; women held up their children on the banks that it might be said in after life that they had seen the Chancellor of the People go by</span>
				<span class='text'>The river was covered like the land</span>
				<span class='text'>Every man who could ply an oar pulled up to give Mr Gladstone a cheer</span>
				<span class='text'>When Lord Palmerston went to Bradford the streets were still, and working men imposed silence upon themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>When Mr Gladstone appeared on the Tyne he heard cheer no other English minister ever heard </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the people were grateful to him, and rough pitmen who never approached a public man before, pressed round his carriage by thousands </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>and thousands of arms were stretched out at once, to shake hands with Mr Gladstone as one of themselves</span>

				<span class='text'>142</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;When Gladstone first joined Palmerston's government in 1859, he opposed further electoral reform, but he changed his position during Palmerston's last premiership, and by 1865 he was firmly in favour of enfranchising the working classes in towns</span>
				<span class='text'>This latter policy created friction with Palmerston, who strongly opposed enfranchisement</span>
				<span class='text'>At the beginning of each [[Parliamentary session|session]], Gladstone would passionately urge the Cabinet to adopt new policies, while Palmerston would fixedly stare at a paper before him</span>
				<span class='text'>At a lull in Gladstone's speech, Palmerston would smile, rap the table with his knuckles, and interject pointedly, &quot;Now, my Lords and gentlemen, let us go to business&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>563</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===American Civil War===As Chancellor, Gladstone made a speech at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] on 7 October 1862 in which he supported the independence of the [[Confederate States of America]] in the [[American Civil War]], claiming that [[Jefferson Davis]] had &quot;made a nation&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not consider slavery a problem; his father owned over two and a half thousand slaves when Gladstone was first elected to Parliament, and the young man helped his father obtain full payment for them</span>
				<span class='text'>Great Britain was officially neutral at the time, and Gladstone later regretted the Newcastle speech</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Queen Victoria]] was not pleased with this statement, and an outraged Palmerston considered it [[sedition|seditious]] incitement to agitation</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Gladstone's support for electoral reform and disestablishment of the [[Church of Ireland|Anglican Church in Ireland]] had alienated him from his constituents in his Oxford University seat, and he lost it in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1865|1865 general election]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A month later, however, he stood as a candidate in [[South Lancashire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Lancashire]], where he was elected third MP (South Lancashire at this time elected three MPs)</span>
				<span class='text'>Palmerston campaigned for Gladstone in Oxford because he believed that his constituents would keep him &quot;partially muzzled&quot;, because many Oxford graduates were Anglican clergymen at that time</span>
				<span class='text'>A victorious Gladstone told his new constituency, &quot;At last, my friends, I am come among you; and I am come—to use an expression which has become very famous and is not likely to be forgotten—I am come 'unmuzzled'</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;On Palmerston's death in October, Earl Russell formed his second ministry</span>
				<span class='text'>Russell &amp; Gladstone (now the senior Liberal in the House of Commons) attempted to pass a reform bill, which was defeated in the House of Commons because of the refusal of the &quot;Adullamite&quot; Whigs, led by Robert Lowe, to support it</span>
				<span class='text'>The Conservatives then formed a ministry, in which after long Parliamentary debate Disraeli passed the [[Reform Act 1867|Second Reform Act of 1867]], more far-reaching than Gladstone's proposed bill had been</span>
				<span class='text'>==Leader of the Liberal Party, from 1867===Lord Russell retired in 1867 and Gladstone became leader of the Liberal Party</span>
				<span class='text'>in 1868 Gladstone proposed the Irish Church Resolutions to reunite the Liberal Party for government (on the issue of disestablishment of the [[Church of Ireland]]&amp;nbsp;– this would be done during Gladstone's First Government in 1869 and meant that Irish [[Roman Catholic]]s did not need to pay their [[tithe]]s to the Anglican Church of Ireland)</span>

				<span class='text'>Gladstone, resting on the handle of his axe, looked up, and with deep earnestness in his voice, and great intensity in his face, exclaimed: '''{{'}}My mission is to pacify Ireland</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the 1860s and 1870s, Gladstonian Liberalism was characterised by a number of policies intended to improve individual liberty and loosen political and economic restraints</span>
				<span class='text'>First was the minimisation of public expenditure on the premise that the economy and society were best helped by allowing people to spend as they saw fit</span>
				<span class='text'>Secondly, his foreign policy aimed at promoting peace to help reduce expenditures and taxation and enhance trade</span>
				<span class='text'>Thirdly, laws that prevented people from acting freely to improve themselves were reformed</span>

				<span class='text'>Matthew has called &quot;the classic mid-Victorian reply&quot; on 20 October 1869:&lt;blockquote&gt;The only means which have been placed in my power of 'raising the wages of colliers' has been by endeavouring to beat down all those restrictions upon trade which tend to reduce the price to be obtained for the product of their labour, &amp; to lower as much as may be the taxes on the commodities which they may require for use or for consumption</span>
				<span class='text'>Beyond this I look to the forethought not yet so widely diffused in this country as in Scotland, &amp; in some foreign lands; &amp; I need not remind you that in order to facilitate its exercise the Government have been empowered by Legislation to become through the Dept</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>they are not your friends, but they are your enemies in fact, though not in intention, who teach you to look to the Legislature for the radical removal of the evils that afflict human life</span>

				<span class='text'>In foreign affairs his over-riding aim was to promote peace and understanding, characterised by his settlement of the [[Alabama Claims|''Alabama'' Claims]] in 1872 in favour of the Americans</span>
				<span class='text'>He also instituted the [[Cardwell Reforms]] in 1869 that made peacetime [[flogging]] illegal and, in 1870, the [[Landlord and Tenant (Ireland) Act 1870|Irish Land Act]] and [[Elementary Education Act 1870|Forster's Education Act]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1871, he instituted the [[Universities Tests Act]]</span>

				<span class='text'> the aggregate amount of the national debt has been reduced by more than 20,000,000''l''</span>
				<span class='text'> that taxes have been lowered or abolished (over and above any amount imposed) to the extent of 12,500,000''l''</span>
				<span class='text'> that during the present year the Alabama Indemnity has been paid, and the charge of the Ashantee War will be met out of revenue; and that in estimating, as we can now venture to do, the income of the coming year (and, for the moment assuming the general scale of charge to continue as it was fixed during the last Session), we do not fear to anticipate as the probable balance a surplus exceeding rather than falling short of 5,000,000''l''</span>

				<span class='text'>The first item </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>which I have to set down in the financial arrangements proper for the first year is relief, but relief coupled with reform, of local taxation</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>It has </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>been the happy fortune of Mr</span>

				<span class='text'>to 4d</span>
				<span class='text'> and then from 4d</span>

				<span class='text'> and at a sacrifice for the financial year of something less than 5,500,000''l''</span>
				<span class='text'>the country may enjoy the advantage and relief of its total repeal</span>
				<span class='text'>I do not hesitate to affirm that an effort should now be made to attain this advantage, nor to declare that, according to my judgment, it is in present circumstances practicable </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>we ought not to aid the rates, and remove the Income Tax, without giving to the general consumer, and giving him simultaneously, some marked relief in the class of articles of popular consumption</span>

				<span class='text'>n November 1874, Gladstone published the pamphlet ''[[The Vatican Decrees in their Bearing on Civil Allegiance]]'', directed at the [[First Vatican Council]]'s dogmatising [[Papal Infallibility]] in 1870, which had outraged him</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone claimed that this decree had placed British Catholics in a dilemma over their loyalty to the Crown and their loyalty to the Pope</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone urged British Catholics to reject papal infallibility as they had opposed the Spanish Armada of 1588</span>
				<span class='text'>The pamphlet sold 150,000 copies by the end of 1874</span>
				<span class='text'>In February 1875 Gladstone published a second pamphlet that was a defence of his earlier pamphlet and a reply to his critics, entitled ''Vaticanism: an Answer to Reproofs and Replies''</span>
				<span class='text'>He described the Catholic Church as &quot;an Asian monarchy: nothing but one giddy height of despotism, and one dead level of religious subservience&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He further claimed that the Pope wanted to destroy the rule of law and replace it with arbitrary tyranny, and then to hide these &quot;crimes against liberty beneath a suffocating cloud of incense&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In a speech to the Hawarden Amateur Horticultural Society on 17 August 1876, Gladstone said that &quot;I am delighted to see how many young boys and girls have come forward to obtain honourable marks of recognition on this occasion,—if any effectual good is to be done to them, it must be done by teaching and encouraging them and helping them to help themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>All the people who pretend to take your own concerns out of your own hands and to do everything for you, I won't say they are imposters; I won't even say they are quacks; but I do say they are mistaken people</span>
				<span class='text'>The only sound, healthy description of countenancing and assisting these institutions is that which teaches independence and self-exertion&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Godley, 1st Baron Kilbracken|Lord Kilbracken]], one of Gladstone's secretaries, said:&lt;blockquote&gt;It will be borne in mind that the Liberal doctrines of that time, with their violent anti-socialist spirit and their strong insistence on the gospel of thrift, self-help, settlement of wages by the higgling of the market, and non-interference by the State</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> I think that Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone was the strongest anti-socialist that I have ever known among persons who gave any serious thought to social and political questions</span>
				<span class='text'>It is quite true, as has been often said, that “we are all socialists up to a certain point”; but Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone fixed that point lower, and was more vehement against those who went above it, than any other politician or official of my acquaintance</span>
				<span class='text'>I remember his speaking indignantly to me of the budget of 1874 as “That socialistic budget of Northcote's,” merely because of the special relief which it gave to the poorer class of income-tax payers</span>
				<span class='text'>His strong belief in Free Trade was only one of the results of his deep-rooted conviction that the Government's interference with the free action of the individual, whether by taxation or otherwise, should be kept at an irreducible minimum</span>
				<span class='text'>It is, indeed, not too much to say that his conception of Liberalism was the negation of Socialism</span>

				<span class='text'>He saw the war as &quot;great dishonour&quot; and also criticised British conduct in the [[Zulu War]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He is ridiculed, no doubt, for what is called saving candle-ends and cheese-parings</span>
				<span class='text'>No Chancellor of the Exchequer is worth his salt who is not ready to save what are meant by candle-ends and cheese-parings in the cause of his country</span>

				<span class='text'>]In 1880, the Liberals won again and the Liberal leaders, [[Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Lord Hartington]] (leader in the House of Commons) and Lord Granville, retired in Gladstone's favour</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone won his constituency election in Midlothian and also in [[Leeds]], where he had also been adopted as a candidate</span>
				<span class='text'>As he could lawfully only serve as MP for one constituency, Leeds was passed to his son [[Herbert Gladstone|Herbert]]</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his other sons, [[William Henry Gladstone|Henry]], was also elected as an MP</span>

				<span class='text'>Gladstone's second administration&amp;nbsp;– both as Prime Minister and again as Chancellor of the Exchequer till 1882&amp;nbsp;– lasted from June 1880 to June 1885</span>
				<span class='text'>He originally intended to retire at the end of 1882, the fiftieth anniversary of his entry into politics, but in the event did not do so</span>
				<span class='text'>==Foreign policy===Historians have been sharply critical of Gladstone's foreign-policy during his second ministry</span>
				<span class='text'> Hayes says it, &quot;provides one of the most intriguing and perplexing tales of mobile and incompetence in foreign affairs, unsurpassed in modern political history until the days of [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Grey]] and, later, [[Neville Chamberlain]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hayes, ''Modern British Foreign Policy: The Twentieth Century: 1880–1939'' (1978) p 1&lt;/ref&gt; Gladstone had opposed himself to the &quot;[[colonialism|colonial lobby]]&quot; pushing for the [[scramble for Africa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His term saw the end of the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]], [[First Boer War]] and the [[Mahdist War|war]] against the [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdi]] in Sudan</span>
				<span class='text'>n 11 July 1882, Gladstone ordered the [[bombardment of Alexandria]], starting the [[1882 Anglo-Egyptian War|Anglo-Egyptian War]], which resulted in the occupation of Egypt</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone's role in the decision to invade was described as relatively hands-off, and that the decision to invade was made by certain members of his cabinet such as [[Spencer Cavendish]], Secretary of State for India, [[Thomas Baring, 1st Earl of Northbrook]], First Lord of the Admiralty, [[Hugh Childers]], Secretary of State for War, and [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville]], the Foreign Secretary</span>

				<span class='text'>In a letter to [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] on 11 February 1885, Gladstone criticised [[Tory Democracy]] as &quot;demagogism&quot; that &quot;put down pacific, law-respecting, economic elements that ennobled the old Conservatism&quot; but &quot;still, in secret, as obstinately attached as ever to the evil principle of class interests&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He found contemporary Liberalism better, &quot;but far from being good&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone claimed that this Liberalism's &quot;pet idea is what they call construction,&amp;nbsp;– that is to say, taking into the hands of the state the business of the individual man&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>The Irish Nationalists, led by [[Charles Stewart Parnell|Charles Parnell]], voted against the Tories on a land Bill</span>
				<span class='text'>The Irish Nationalists held the balance of power in Parliament at this time, Gladstone's conversion had convinced them to support the Liberal Government by using the 86 seats of Parliament they controlled</span>
				<span class='text'>The main purpose of this administration was to deliver Ireland a reform which would give them a devolved assembly, similar to that which has been enjoyed by Scotland and Wales since 1998</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1886 Gladstone's party was allied with Irish Nationalists to defeat [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]'s government</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone regained his position as Prime Minister and combined the office with that of [[Lord Privy Seal]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During this administration he first introduced his [[Home Rule Bill]] for Ireland</span>
				<span class='text'>The issue split the Liberal Party (a breakaway group went on to create the [[Liberal Unionist]] party) and the bill was thrown out on the second reading, ending his government after only a few months and inaugurating another headed by Lord Salisbury</span>
				<span class='text'>ladstone, says his biographer, &quot;totally rejected the widespread English view that the Irish had no taste for justice, common sense, moderation our national prosperity and looked only to perpetual strife and dissension</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt; Roy Jenkins, ''Gladstone: A Biography'' (1997) p 553&lt;/ref&gt; The problem for Gladstone was his rural supporters in England would not support home rule for Ireland</span>

				<span class='text'>Whenever the Liberals were out of power, home rule proposals languished</span>
				<span class='text'>=Opposition (1886–1892)==Gladstone supported the London dockers in their [[London Dock Strike of 1889|strike of 1889]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After their victory he gave a speech at Hawarden on 23 September in which he said: &quot;In the common interests of humanity, this remarkable strike and the results of this strike, which have tended somewhat to strengthen the condition of labour in the face of capital, is the record of what we ought to regard as satisfactory, as a real social advance [that] tends to a fair principle of division of the fruits of industry&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>On 23 October at [[Southport]], Gladstone delivered a speech where he claimed that the right to combination, which in London was &quot;innocent and lawful, in Ireland would be penal and</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>unished by imprisonment with hard labour&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Gladstone believed that the right to combination used by British workers was in jeopardy when it could be denied to Irish workers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barker, p</span>
				<span class='text'>93</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In October 1890 Gladstone at Midlothian claimed that competition between capital and labour, &quot;where it has gone to sharp issues, where there have been strikes on one side and lock-outs on the other, I believe that in the main and as a general rule, the labouring man has been in the right&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barker, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>93–94</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On 11 December 1891 Gladstone said that: &quot;It is a lamentable fact if, in the midst of our civilisation, and at the close of the nineteenth century, the workhouse is all that can be offered to the industrious labourer at the end of a long and honourable life</span>
				<span class='text'>I do not enter into the question now in detail</span>
				<span class='text'>I do not say it is an easy one; I do not say that it will be solved in a moment; but I do say this, that until society is able to offer to the industrious labourer at the end of a long and blameless life something better than the workhouse, society will not have discharged its duties to its poorer members&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>o the conclusion that there is something painful in the condition of the rural labourer in this great respect, that it is hard even for the industrious and sober man, under ordinary conditions, to secure a provision for his own old age</span>
				<span class='text'> Very large propositions, involving, some of them, very novel and very wide principles, have been submitted to the public, for the purpose of securing such a provision by means independent of the labourer himself</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>our duty [is] to develop in the first instance, every means that we may possibly devise whereby, if possible, the labourer may be able to make this provision for himself, or to approximate towards making such provision far more efficaciously and much more closely than he can now do</span>

				<span class='text'>In a fragment of autobiography dated 25 July 1894, Gladstone denounced the tax as&lt;blockquote&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>y far the most Radical measure of my lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'>I do not object to the principle of graduated taxation: for the just principle of ability to pay is not determined simply by the amount of income</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> But, so far as I understand the present measure of finance from the partial reports I have received, I find it too violent</span>
				<span class='text'>It involves a great departure from the methods of political action established in this country, where reforms, and especially financial reforms, have always been considerate and even tender</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> I do not yet see the ground on which it can be justly held that any one description of ''property'' should be more heavily burdened than others, unless moral and social grounds can be shown first: but in this case the reasons drawn from those sources seem rather to verge in the opposite direction, for real property has more of presumptive connection with the discharge of duty that that which is ranked as personal</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he aspect of the measure is not satisfactory to a man of my traditions (and these traditions lie near the roots of my being)</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> For the sudden introduction of such change there is I think no precedent in the history of this country</span>

				<span class='text'>Gladstone is said to have been the most powerful magician to ever become Prime Minister, and though he is not included as a character, several objects of his are central plot points</span>
				<span class='text'>The book provides an alternate history of Gladstone, in which he killed Disraeli in a duel and assisted British forces in colonial expansion</span>
				<span class='text'>n science fiction, Gladstone is an MP in Stephen Baxter's novel, [[Anti-Ice]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After the intervention of Sir Josiah Traveller and Ned Vickers in halting the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1871 with apocalyptic Anti-Ice weapons, a [[cold war]] settles over Europe in the late 19th Century</span>
				<span class='text'>The peace is maintained by the ministry of Gladstone, and the incredibly destructive medium-range ballistic missiles for delivery of Anti-Ice weapons are termed 'Gladstone Shells', which set the scene for a First World War in 1914 of such ferocity as to resemble nuclear warfare three generations early</span>
				<span class='text'>The novel ends on an ambiguous note, with the Gladstone Shell now a component of British diplomacy and deterrence of war between Prussia and France</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;He was filled with zeal</span>
				<span class='text'>It overturned his ideas and changed the direction of his interest</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, the explicit threats of Gladstone to the Qur'an and Islamic world caused a revolution in Nursi's ideas, clarifying them and setting him in the direction he would now follow</span>
