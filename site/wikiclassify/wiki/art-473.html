				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;145 or 135{{spaced ndash}}86 BC), [[Wade-Giles|formerly romanized]] '''Ssu-ma Chien''', was a Chinese historian of the [[Han dynasty]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He is considered the father of [[Chinese historiography]] for his work, the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', a ''[[Jizhuanti]]''-style (history presented in a series of biographies) general history of [[China]], covering more than two thousand years from the [[Yellow Emperor]] to his time, during the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he worked as the Court Astrologer ([[Chinese characters|Chinese]]: Â§™Âè≤‰ª§; ''T√†ish«ê L√¨ng''), later generations refer to him as the Grand Historian ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: Â§™Âè≤ÂÖ¨; T√†ish«ê G≈çng or tai-shih-kung) for his monumental work; a work which in later generations would often only be somewhat tacitly or glancingly acknowledged as an achievement only made possible by his acceptance and endurance of punitive actions against him, including imprisonment, castration, and subjection to servility</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life and education==Sima Qian was born at Xiayang in Zuopingyi (near modern [[Hancheng]], [[Shaanxi Province]]) around 145{{sbc}}, though some sources give his birth year as around 135{{sbc}}</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=959}} His father, [[Sima Tan]], around 136{{sbc}} received an appointment to the relatively low-ranking position of &quot;grand historian&quot; (''t√†ish«ê'' {{lang|zh|Â§™Âè≤}}, alt</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;grand scribe&quot; or &quot;grand astrologer&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|de Crespigny|2007|p=1222}}{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=960}} The grand historian's primary duty was to formulate the yearly calendar, identifying which days were ritually auspicious or inauspicious, and present it to the emperor prior to New Year's Day</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=960}} Besides these duties, the grand historian was also to travel with the emperor for important rituals and to record the daily events both at the court and within the country</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=291}} By his account, by the age of ten Sima was able to &quot;read the old writings&quot; and was considered to be a promising scholar</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=291}} Sima grew up in a family atmosphere strongly filled with Confucianism, and Sima always regarded his historical work as an act of Confucian filial piety to his beloved father</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=291}} In 126{{sbc}}, around the age of twenty, Sima Qian began an extensive tour around China as it existed in the Han dynasty, and became probably one of the most widely traveled men of his generation</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=960}}  He started his journey from the imperial capital, Chang'an (modern [[Xi'an]]), then went south across the [[Yangtze River]] to Changsha (modern [[Hunan Province]]), where he visited the [[Miluo River]] site where the ancient poet [[Qu Yuan]] was traditionally said to have drowned himself</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=960}} He then went to seek the burial place of the legendary [[Xia dynasty]] rulers [[Yu (Xia dynasty ruler)|Yu]] on [[Mount Kuaiji]] and [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]] in the Jiuyi Mountains (modern [[Ningyuan County]], Hunan)</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=960}}{{sfnp|Watson|1958|p=47}} He then went north to Huaiyin (modern [[Huai'an]], [[Jiangsu Province]]) to see the grave of Han dynasty general [[Han Xin]], then continued north to [[Qufu]], the hometown of [[Confucius]], where he studied ritual and other traditional subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=960}}==As Han court official==After his travels, Sima was chosen to be a Palace Attendant in the government, whose duties were to inspect different parts of the country with Emperor Wu</span>
				<span class='text'>In 110&amp;nbsp;BC, at the age of thirty-five, Sima Qian was sent westward on a military expedition against some &quot;barbarian&quot; tribes</span>
				<span class='text'>That year, his father fell ill and could not attend the Imperial Feng Sacrifice</span>
				<span class='text'>Suspecting his time was running out, he summoned his son back home to complete the historical work he had begun</span>
				<span class='text'>Sima Tan wanted to follow the ''[[Annals of Spring and Autumn]]'' - the first chronicle in the history of [[Chinese literature]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Fueled by his father's inspiration, Sima Qian started to compile ''[[Shiji]]'', which became known in English as the ''Records of the Grand Historian'', in 109&amp;nbsp;BC</span>
				<span class='text'>Three years after the death of his father, Sima Qian assumed his father's previous position as Court Astrologer</span>
				<span class='text'> In 105&amp;nbsp;BC, Sima was among the scholars chosen to reform the calendar</span>
				<span class='text'>As a senior imperial official, Sima was also in the position to offer counsel to the emperor on general affairs of state</span>
				<span class='text'>==The Li Ling affair===[[File:Sima Qian</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|Portrait of Sima Qian]]In 99&amp;nbsp;BC, Sima Qian became embroiled in the Li Ling affair, where [[Li Ling]] and [[Li Guangli]], two military officers who led a campaign against the [[Xiongnu]] in the north, were defeated and taken captive</span>
				<span class='text'>Emperor Wu attributed the defeat to Li Ling, with all government officials subsequently condemning him for it</span>
				<span class='text'>Sima was the only person to defend Li Ling, who had never been his friend but whom he respected</span>
				<span class='text'>Emperor Wu interpreted Sima's defence of Li as an attack on his brother-in-law, who had also fought against the Xiongnu without much success, and sentenced Sima to death</span>
				<span class='text'>At that time, execution could be [[commutation of sentence|commuted]] either by money or [[castration]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Since Sima did not have enough money to atone his &quot;crime&quot;, he chose the latter and was then thrown into prison, where he endured three years</span>
				<span class='text'>He described his pain thus: &quot;When you see the jailer you abjectly touch the ground with your forehead</span>
				<span class='text'>At the mere sight of his underlings you are seized with terror</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Such ignominy can never be wiped away</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Sima called his castration &quot;the worse of all punishments&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=291}}In 96&amp;nbsp;BC, on his release from prison, Sima chose to live on as a palace [[eunuch]] to complete his histories, rather than commit suicide as was expected of a gentleman-scholar</span>
				<span class='text'>As Sima Qian himself explained in his ''Letter to Ren An'':{{quote|If even the lowest slave and scullion maid can bear to commit suicide, why should not one like myself be able to do what has to be done? But the reason I have not refused to bear these ills and have continued to live, dwelling in vileness and disgrace without taking my leave, is that I grieve that I have things in my heart which I have not been able to express fully, and I am shamed to think that after I am gone my writings will not be known to posterity</span>
				<span class='text'>Too numerous to record are the men of ancient times who were rich and noble and whose names have yet vanished away</span>
				<span class='text'>It is only those who were masterful and sure, the truly extraordinary men, who are still remembered</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I too have ventured not to be modest but have entrusted myself to my useless writings</span>
				<span class='text'>I have gathered up and brought together the old traditions of the world which were scattered and lost</span>
				<span class='text'>I have examined the deeds and events of the past and investigated the principles behind their success and failure, their rise and decay, in one hundred and thirty chapters</span>
				<span class='text'>I wished to examine into all that concerns heaven and man, to penetrate the changes of the past and present, completing all as the work of one family</span>
				<span class='text'>But before I had finished my rough manuscript, I met with this calamity</span>
				<span class='text'>It is because I regretted that it had not been completed that I submitted to the extreme penalty without rancor</span>
				<span class='text'>When I have truly completed this work, I shall deposit it in the Famous Mountain</span>
				<span class='text'>If it may be handed down to men who will appreciate it, and penetrate to the villages and great cities, then though I should suffer a thousand mutilations, what regret should I have? |Sima Qian, translation by [[Burton Watson]]{{sfnp|Watson|1958|pp=57-67}}}}==Historian==[[File:Shiji</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|right|thumb|The first page of ''Shiji''</span>
				<span class='text'>]Although the style and form of Chinese historical writings varied through the ages, the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' (''[[Shiji]]'') has defined the quality and style from then onwards</span>
				<span class='text'>Before Sima, histories were written as certain events or certain periods of history of states; his idea of a general history affected later historiographers like Zheng Qiao (ÈÉëÊ®µ) in writing ''Tongshi'' (ÈÄöÂè≤) and [[Sima Guang]] in writing ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The Chinese historical form of dynasty history, or ''jizhuanti'' history of dynasties, was codified in the second dynastic history by [[Ban Gu]]'s ''[[Han Shu|Book of Han]]'', but historians regard Sima's work as their model, which stands as the &quot;official format&quot; of the [[history of China]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ima was greatly influenced by Confucius‚Äôs ''Spring and Autumn Annals'', which on the surface is a succinct chronology from the events of the reigns of the twelve dukes of Lu from 722 to 484 BC</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=291}} Many Chinese scholars have and still do view how Confucius ordered his chronology as the ideal example of how history should be written, especially with regards to what he chose to include and to exclude; and his choice of words as indicating moral judgements {{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=291}} Seen in this light, the ''Spring and Autumn Annals'' are a moral guide to the proper way of living</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=292}} Sima took this view himself as he explained: &lt;blockquote&gt;It [''Spring and Autumn Annals''] distinguishes what is suspicious and doubtful, clarifies right and wrong, and settles points which are uncertain</span>
				<span class='text'>It calls good good and bad bad, honours the worthy, and condemns the unworthy</span>
				<span class='text'>It preserves states which are lost and restores the perishing family</span>
				<span class='text'>It brings to light what was neglected and restores what was abandoned</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=292}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Sima saw the ''Shiji'' as being in the same tradition as he explained in his introduction to chapter 61 of the ''Shiji'' where he wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt; ‚ÄúSome people say 'It is Heaven‚Äôs way, without distinction of persons, to keep the good perpetually supplied</span>
				<span class='text'>' Can we say then that Po I and Shu Ch'I were good men or not? They clung to righteousness and were pure in their deeds‚Ä¶yet they starved to death‚Ä¶Robber Chih day after day killed innocent men, making mincemeat of their flesh‚Ä¶But in the end he lived to a great old age</span>
				<span class='text'>For what virtue did he deserve this? ‚Ä¶I find myself in much perplexity</span>
				<span class='text'>Is this so-called  'Way of Heaven' right or wrong?‚Äù{{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=292}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; To resolve this theodical problem, Sima argued that while the wicked may succeed and the good may suffer in their own life-times, it is the historian who ensures that in the end good triumphs</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=292}} For Sima, the writing of history was no mere antiquarian pursuit, but was rather a vital moral task as the historian would ‚Äúpreserve memory‚Äù, and thereby ensure the ultimate victory of good over evil</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=292}}  Along these lines, Sima wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt; ‚ÄúSu Ch‚Äôin and his two brothers all achieved fame among the feudal lords as itinerant strategists</span>
				<span class='text'>Their policies laid great stress upon stratagems and shifts of power</span>
				<span class='text'>But because Su Ch‚Äôin died a traitor‚Äôs death, the world has united in scoffing at him and has been loath to study his policies‚Ä¶Su Ch‚Äôin arouse from the humblest beginnings to lead the Six States in the Vertical Alliance, and this is evidence that he possessed an intelligence surpassing the ordinary person</span>
				<span class='text'>For this reason I have set forth this account of his deeds, arranging them in proper chronological order, so that he may not forever suffer from an evil reputation and be known for nothing else‚Äù</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|pp=292-293}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Such a moralizing approach to history with the historian high-guiding the good and evil to provide lessons for the present could be dangerous for the historian as it could bring down the wrath of the state onto to the historian as happened to Sima himself</span>
				<span class='text'>As such, the historian had to tread carefully and often expressed his judgements in a circuitous way designed to fool the censor</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=293}}Sima himself in the conclusion to chapter 110 of the ''Shiji'' declared that he was a writing in this tradition where he stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;‚ÄúWhen Confucius wrote the ''Spring and Autumn Annals'', he was very open in treating the reigns of Yin and Huan, the early dukes of Lu; but when he came to the later period of Dukes Ding and Ai, his writing was much more covert</span>
				<span class='text'>Because in the latter case he was writing about his own times, he did not express his judgements frankly, but used subtle and guarded language</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù{{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=293}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; Bearing this in mind, not everything that Sima wrote should be understand as conveying didactical moral lessons</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=293}} But several historians have suggested that parts of the ''Shiji'', such as where Sima placed his section on Confucius‚Äôs use of indirect criticism in the part of the book dealing with the Xiongnu ‚Äúbarbarians‚Äù might indicate his disapproval of the foreign policy of the Emperor Wu</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=293}}In writing ''Shiji'', Sima initiated a new writing style by presenting history in a series of biographies</span>
				<span class='text'>His work extends over 130 chapters ‚Äî not in historical sequence, but divided into particular subjects, including [[annals]], [[chronicle]]s, and [[treatise]]s ‚Äî on music, ceremonies, calendars, religion, economics, and extended biographies</span>
				<span class='text'>Sima's work influenced the writing style of other histories outside of China as well, such as the [[Goryeo]] (Korean) history the ''[[Samguk Sagi]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Sima adopted a new method in sorting out the historical data and a new approach to writing historical records</span>
				<span class='text'>At the beginning of the ''Shiji'', Sima declared himself a follower of Confucius‚Äôs approach in the ''Analects'' to ‚Äúhear much but leave to one side that which is doubtful, and speak with due caution concerning the remainder‚Äù</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=293}} Reflecting these rigorous analytic methods, Sima declared that he would not write about periods of history where they was insufficient documentation</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=293}} As such, Sima wrote ‚Äúthe ages before the Ch‚Äôin dynasty are too far away and the material on them too scanty to permit a detailed account of them here‚Äù</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=293}} In the same way, Sima discounted accounts in the traditional records that were ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù such as the pretense that Prince Tan could via the use of magic make the clouds rain grain and horses grow horns</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=293}} Sima constantly compared accounts found in the manuscripts with what he considered reliable sources like Confucian classics like the ''[[Classic of Poetry|Book of Odes]]'', ''[[Book of Documents|Book of History]]'', ''[[Book of Rites]]'', ''[[Classic of Music|Book of Music]]'', ''[[I Ching|Book of Changes]]'' and ''Spring and Autumn Annals''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=293}} When Sima encountered a story that could not be cross-checked with the Confucian classics, he systemically compared the information with other documents</span>
				<span class='text'>Sima mentioned at least 75 books he used for cross-checking</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=294}} Furthermore, Sima often questioned people about historical events they had experienced</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=293}} Sima mentioned after one of his trips across China that: ‚ÄúWhen I had occasion to pass through Feng and Beiyi questioned the elderly people who were about the place, visited the old home of [[Xiao He]], [[Cao Shen|Cao Can]], [[Fan Kuai]] and [[Xiahou Ying]], and learned much about the early days</span>
				<span class='text'>How different it was from the stories one hears!‚Äù{{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=294}}Despite his very large debts to Confucian tradition, Sima was an innovator in four ways</span>
				<span class='text'>To begin with, Sima‚Äôs work was concerned with the history of the known world</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=294}} Previous Chinese historians had only focused on only one dynasty and/or region</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=294}} Sima‚Äôs history of 130 chapters began with the legendary Yellow Emperor to his own time, and covered not only China, but also neighbouring nations like Korea and Vietnam</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=294}} Sima also broke new ground by using more sources like interviewing witnesses, visiting places where historical occurrences had happened, and examining documents from different regions and/or times</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=294}}  Before Chinese historians had tended to use only reign histories as their sources</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=294}} The ''Shiji'' was further very novel in Chinese historiography by examining historical events outside of the courts, providing a broader history than the traditional court-based histories had done</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=294}} Lastly, Sima broke with the traditional chronological structure of Chinese history</span>
				<span class='text'>Sima instead had divided the ''Shiji''  into five divisions: the basic annals which comprised the first 12 chapters, the chronological tables which comprised the next 10 chapters, treatises on particular subjects which make up 8 chapters, accounts of the ruling families which take up 30 chapters, and biographies of various eminent people which are the last 70 chapters</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=294}} The annals follow the traditional Chinese pattern of court-based histories of the lives of various emperors and their families</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=294}} The chronological tables are graphs recounting the political history of China</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=294}}  The treatises are essays on topics such as astronomy, music, religion, hydraulic engineering and economics</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=294}} The last section dealing with biographies cover both famous people, both Chinese and foreign</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=294}}  Unlike traditional Chinese historians, Sima went beyond the androcentric, emperor-focused histories by dealing with the lives of women and men such as poets, bureaucrats, merchants, assassins, and philosophers</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=295}}When Sima placed his subjects was often his way of expressing obliquely moral judgements</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=295}} [[Empress L√º Zhi|Empress L√º]] and [[Xiang Yu]] were the effective rulers of China during reigns Hui of the Han and Yi of Chu respectively, so Sima placed both lives in basic annals</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=295}} Likewise, Confucius is included in the fourth section rather the fifth where he properly belonged as a way of showing his eminent virtue</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=295}}  The structure of the ''Shiji'' allowed Sima to tell the same stories in different ways, which allowed him to pass his moral judgements</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=295}} For example, in the basic annals section, the [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Emperor Gaozu]] is portrayed as a good leader whereas in the section dealing with his rival Xiang Yu, the Emperor is portrayed unflatteringly</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=295}} Likewise, the chapter on Xiang presents him in a favorable light whereas the chapter on Gaozu portrays him in more darker colors</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=295}} At the end of most of the chapters, Sima usually wrote a commentary in which he judged how the individual lived up to traditional Chinese values like filial piety, humility, self-discipline, hard work and concern for the less fortunate</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=295}} Sima analyzed the records and sorted out those that could serve the purpose of ''Shiji''</span>
				<span class='text'>He intended to discover the patterns and principles of the development of human history</span>
				<span class='text'>Sima also emphasized, for the first time in Chinese history, the role of individual men in affecting the historical development of China and his historical perception that a country cannot escape from the fate of growth and decay</span>
				<span class='text'>nlike the ''Book of Han'', which was written under the supervision of the imperial dynasty, ''Shiji'' was a privately written history since he refused to write ''Shiji'' as an official history covering only those of high rank</span>
				<span class='text'>The work also covers people of the lower classes and is therefore considered a &quot;veritable record&quot; of the darker side of the dynasty</span>
				<span class='text'>=Literary figure==Sima's ''Shiji'' is respected as a model of biographical literature with high literary value and still stands as a textbook for the study of classical Chinese</span>
				<span class='text'>Sima's works were influential to Chinese writing, serving as ideal models for various types of prose within the neo-classical (&quot;renaissance&quot; Â§çÂè§) movement of the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]]-[[Song dynasty|Song]] period</span>
				<span class='text'>The great use of characterisation and plotting also influenced fiction writing, including the classical short stories of the middle and late medieval period ([[Tang dynasty|Tang]]-[[Ming Dynasty|Ming]]) as well as the vernacular novel of the late imperial period</span>
				<span class='text'>Sima had immense influence on historiography not only in China, but also in Japan and Korea</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=296}} For centuries afterwards, the ''Shiji'' was regarded as the greatest history book written in Asia</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=296}} Sima is little known in the English-speaking world as a full translation of the ''Shiji'' has never been attempted</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfnp|Hughes-Warrington|2000|p=296}}His influence was derived primarily from the following elements of his writing: his skillful depiction of historical characters using details of their speech, conversations, and actions; his innovative use of informal, humorous, and varied language; and the simplicity and conciseness of his style</span>
				<span class='text'>Even the 20th century literary critic [[Lu Xun]] regarded ''Shiji'' as &quot;the historians' most perfect song, a &quot;[[Li Sao]]&quot; without the rhyme&quot;(Âè≤ÂÆ∂‰πãÁªùÂî±ÔºåÊó†Èüµ‰πãÁ¶ªÈ™ö) in his &quot;Hanwenxueshi Gangyao&quot; (Ê±âÊñáÂ≠¶Âè≤Á∫≤Ë¶Å)</span>
				<span class='text'>==Other literary works===Sima's famous letter to his friend Ren An about his sufferings during the Li Ling Affair and his perseverance in writing ''Shiji'' is today regarded as a highly admired example of literary prose style, studied widely in China even today</span>
				<span class='text'>ima Qian wrote eight rhapsodies (''[[Fu (literature)|fu]]'' Ëµã), which are listed in the bibliographic treatise of the ''Book of Han''</span>
