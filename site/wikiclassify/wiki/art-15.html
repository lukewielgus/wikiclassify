				<span class='text'>In Ginsbergs freshman year at Columbia he met fellow undergraduate  who introduced him to a number of future Beat writers including   and </span>
				<span class='text'>They bonded because they saw in one another an excitement about the potential of American youth a potential that existed outside the strict conformist confines of post‚ÄìWorld War II McCarthy era America</span>

				<span class='text'>As Ever The Collected Correspondence of Allen Ginsberg amp Neal Cassady</span>
				<span class='text'> In the first chapter of his 1957 novel  Kerouac described the meeting between Ginsberg and Cassady</span>
				<span class='text'>name Modern   Kerouac saw them as the dark Ginsberg and light Cassady side of their New Vision a perception stemming partly from Ginsbergs association with communism of which Kerouac had become increasingly distrustful</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Ginsberg was never a member of the Communist Party Kerouac named him Carlo Marx in On the Road</span>
				<span class='text'>This was a source of strain in their relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>name Miles Also in New York Ginsberg met  in the Pony Stable Bar</span>
				<span class='text'>Corso recently released from prison was supported by the Pony Stable patrons and was writing poetry there the night of their meeting</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg claims he was immediately attracted to Corso who was straight but understanding of homosexuality after three years in prison</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg was even more struck by reading Corsos poems realizing Corso was spiritually gifted</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg introduced Corso to the rest of his inner circle</span>
				<span class='text'>In their first meeting at the Pony Stable Corso showed Ginsberg a poem about a woman who lived across the street from him and sunbathed naked in the window</span>
				<span class='text'>Amazingly the woman happened to be Ginsbergs girlfriend that he was living with during one of his forays into heterosexuality</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg took Corso over to their apartment</span>
				<span class='text'>There the woman proposed sex with Corso who was still very young and fled in fear</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg introduced Corso to Kerouac and Burroughs and they began to travel together</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg and Corso remained lifelong friends and collaborators</span>
				<span class='text'>name Miles Shortly after this period in Ginsbergs life he became romantically involved with  after meeting her through Alex Greer a philosophy professor at  whom she had dated for a while during the burgeoning Beat generations period of development</span>
				<span class='text'>As a Barnard student Elise Cowen extensively read the poetry of  and  when she met  and Leo Skir among other Beat players</span>
				<span class='text'> As Cowen had felt a strong attraction to darker poetry most of the time Beat poetry seemed to provide an allure to what suggests a shadowy side of her persona</span>
				<span class='text'> While at Barnard Cowen earned the nickname Beat Alice as she had joined a small group of anti establishment artists and visionaries known to outsiders as beatniks and one of her first acquaintances at the college was the beat poet Joyce Johnson who later portrayed Cowen in her books including Minor Characters and Come and Join the Dance which expressed the two womens experiences in the Barnard and Columbia Beat community</span>
				<span class='text'>Through his association with Elise Cowen Ginsberg discovered that they shared a mutual friend Carl Solomon to whom he later dedicated his most famous poem Howl</span>
				<span class='text'>This poem is considered an autobiography of Ginsberg up to 1955 and a brief history of the Beat Generation through its erences to his relationship to other Beat artists of that time</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1948 in an apartment in  Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination while reading the poetry of  later erred to as his Blake vision</span>
				<span class='text'>At first Ginsberg claimed to have heard the voice of God but later interpreted the voice as that of Blake himself reading   and Little Girl Lost also described by Ginsberg as voice of the ancient of days</span>
				<span class='text'>The experience lasted several days</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe</span>
				<span class='text'>He looked at lattice work on the  and realized some hand had crafted that he then looked at the sky and intuited that some hand had crafted that also or rather that the sky was the hand that crafted itself</span>
				<span class='text'>He explained that this hallucination was not inspired by drug use but said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs</span>
				<span class='text'>name Miles  Ginsberg stated living blue hand itself Existence itself was God and I felt a sudden awakening into a totally deeper real universe</span>
				<span class='text'>insberg moved to San Francisco during the 1950s</span>
				<span class='text'>Before Howl and Other Poems was published in 1956 by City Lights Bookshop he worked as a market researcher</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1954 in San Francisco Ginsberg met  1933‚Äì2010 with whom he fell in love and who remained his lifelong partner</span>

				<span class='text'>Ginsbergs mentor  wrote an introductory letter to San Francisco Renaissance figurehead  who then introduced Ginsberg into the San Francisco poetry scene</span>
				<span class='text'>There Ginsberg also met three budding poets and  enthusiasts who had become friends at    and </span>
				<span class='text'>In 1959 along with poets John Kelly   and William Margolis Ginsberg was one of the founders of the Beatitude poetry magazine</span>
				<span class='text'>‚Äî a painter and co founder of the Six Gallery ‚Äì approached Ginsberg in mid 1955 and asked him to organize a poetry reading at the Six Gallery</span>
				<span class='text'>At first Ginsberg used but once he had written a rough draft of Howl he changed his fucking mind as he put it</span>
				<span class='text'>name Raskin   Ginsberg advertised the event as Six Poets at the Six Gallery</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the most important events in Beat mythos known simply as The  took place on October 7 1955</span>
				<span class='text'>name npr  The event in essence brought together the East and West Coast factions of the Beat Generation</span>
				<span class='text'>Of more personal significance to Ginsberg the reading that night included the first public presentation of Howl a poem that brought worldwide fame to Ginsberg and to many of the poets associated with him</span>
				<span class='text'>An account of that night can be found in s novel  describing how change was collected from audience members to buy jugs of wine and Ginsberg reading passionately drunken with arms outstretched</span>
				<span class='text'>insbergs principal work Howl is well known for its opening line I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness starving hysterical naked</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Howl was considered scandalous at the time of its publication because of the rawness of its language</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly after its 1956 publication by San Franciscos  it was banned for obscenity</span>
				<span class='text'>The ban became a  among defenders of the  and was later lifted after Judge Clayton W</span>
				<span class='text'>Horn declared the poem to possess redeeming artistic value</span>
				<span class='text'>name Miles  Ginsberg and  the City Lights manager who was jailed for selling Howl became lifelong friends</span>
				<span class='text'>all Gordon Howl and Other Victories A friend remembers City Lights Shig Murao San Francisco Chronicle 11 28 99</span>
				<span class='text'> Ginsberg claimed at one point that all of his work was an extended biography like Kerouacs Duluoz Legend</span>
				<span class='text'>Howl is not only a biography of Ginsbergs experiences before 1955 but also a history of the Beat Generation</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg also later claimed that at the core of Howl were his unresolved emotions about his schizophrenic mother</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Kaddish deals more explicitly with his mother Howl in many ways is driven by the same emotions</span>
				<span class='text'>Howl chronicles the development of many important friendships throughout Ginsberg‚Äôs life</span>
				<span class='text'> He begins the poem with ‚ÄúI saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness‚Äù which sets the stage for Ginsberg to describe Cassady and Solomon immortalizing them into American literature</span>
				<span class='text'>name Raskin   This madness was the ‚Äúangry fix‚Äù that society needed to function‚Äîmadness was its disease</span>
				<span class='text'>In the poem Ginsberg focused on ‚ÄúCarl Solomon I‚Äôm with you in Rockland‚Äù and thus turned Solomon into an archetypal figure searching for freedom from his ‚Äústraightjacket‚Äù</span>
				<span class='text'>Though erences in most of his poetry reveal much about his biography his relationship to other members of the Beat Generation and his own political views Howl his most famous poem is still perhaps the best place to start</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1957 Ginsberg surprised the literary world by abandoning San Francisco</span>
				<span class='text'>After a spell in  he and Peter Orlovsky joined Gregory Corso in Paris</span>
				<span class='text'>Corso introduced them to a shabby lodging house above a bar at 9 rue G√Æt le Coeur that was to become known as the </span>
				<span class='text'>They were soon joined by Burroughs and others</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a productive creative time for all of them</span>
				<span class='text'>There Ginsberg began his epic poem Kaddish Corso composed Bomb and Marriage and Burroughs with help from Ginsberg and Corso put together  from previous writings</span>
				<span class='text'>This period was documented by the photographer  who moved in at about the same time and took pictures constantly of the residents of the hotel until it closed in 1963</span>
				<span class='text'>During 1962‚Äì3 Ginsberg and Orlovsky travelled extensively across  living half a year at a time in  Kolkata and Benares Varanasi</span>
				<span class='text'>Also during this time he formed friendships with some of the prominent young  poets of the time including  and </span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg had several political connections in India most notably  who helped him extend his stay in India when the authorities were eager to expel him</span>

				<span class='text'>The event attracted an audience of 7000 who heard readings and live and tape performances by a wide variety of figures including Ginsberg       Gregory Corso     and </span>

				<span class='text'>A book featuring images from the film and some of the poems that were performed was also published under the same title by Lorrimer in the UK and Grove Press in US</span>
				<span class='text'>hough the term Beat is most accurately applied to Ginsberg and his closest friends Corso Orlovsky Kerouac Burroughs etc</span>
				<span class='text'>the term Beat Generation has become associated with many of the other poets Ginsberg met and became friends with in the late 1950s and early 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>A key feature of this term seems to be a friendship with Ginsberg</span>
				<span class='text'>Friendship with Kerouac or Burroughs might also apply but both writers later strove to disassociate themselves from the name Beat Generation</span>
				<span class='text'>Part of their dissatisfaction with the term came from the mistaken identification of Ginsberg as the leader</span>

				<span class='text'>name Spontaneous One contribution that is often considered his most significant and most controversial was his openness about homosexuality</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg was an early proponent of freedom for gay people</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1943 he discovered within himself mountains of homosexuality</span>
				<span class='text'>He expressed this desire openly and graphically in his poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>He also struck a note for gay marriage by listing  his lifelong companion as his spouse in his  entry</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequent gay writers saw his frank talk about homosexuality as an opening to speak more openly and honestly about something often before only hinted at or spoken of in metaphor</span>
				<span class='text'>name Deliberate In writing about sexuality in graphic detail and in his frequent use of language seen as indecent he challenged‚Äîand ultimately changed‚Äîobscenity laws</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a staunch supporter of others whose expression challenged obscenity laws  and  for example</span>
				<span class='text'>insberg was a supporter and member of  NAMBLA name PedIJN  saying that Attacks on NAMBLA stink of politics witchhunting for profit humorlessness vanity anger and ignorance </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Im a member of NAMBLA because I love boys too‚Äì everybody does who has a little humanity</span>
				<span class='text'> In Thoughts on NAMBLA a 1994 essay published in the collection  Ginsberg stated NAMBLAs a forum for orm of those laws on youthful sexuality which members deem oppressive a discussion society not a sex club</span>
				<span class='text'>I joined NAMBLA in defense of free speech</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1994 Ginsberg appeared in a documentary on NAMBLA called  playing on  in which he read a graphic ode to youth</span>
				<span class='text'>name PedIJN  Ginsberg also talked often about drug use</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout the 1960s he took an active role in the demystification of LSD and with  worked to promote its common use</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also for many decades an advocate of  legalization and at the same time warned his audiences against the hazards of tobacco in his Put Down Your Cigarette Rag Dont Smoke Dont Smoke Dont Smoke Nicotine Nicotine No   No dont smoke the official Dope Smoke Dope Dope</span>
				<span class='text'>hrough his own drug use and the drug use of his friends and associates Ginsberg became more and more preoccupied with the American governments relationship to drug use within and outside the nation</span>
				<span class='text'>He worked closely with Alfred W</span>
				<span class='text'>McCoy who was writing The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia which tracked the history of the American governments involvement in illegal opium dealing around the world</span>
				<span class='text'>This would affirm Ginsbergs suspicions that the government and the CIA were involved in drug trafficking</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to working with McCoy Ginsberg personally confronted  the director of the CIA in the 1970s but he was simply brushed off as being full of beans</span>
				<span class='text'>Allen wrote many essays and articles researching and compiling evidence of CIAs involvement but it would take ten years and the publication of McCoys book in 1972 before anyone took him seriously</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1978 Ginsberg received a note from the chief editor of the  apologizing for not taking his allegations seriously so many years previous</span>

				<span class='text'>470‚Äì477</span>
				<span class='text'> The political subject is dealt with in his song poem CIA Dope calypso</span>
				<span class='text'>orkThough early on Ginsberg had intentions to be a labor lawyer he wrote poetry for most of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of his very early poetry was written in formal rhyme and meter like that of his father or his idol </span>
				<span class='text'>His admiration for the writing of Jack Kerouac inspired him to take poetry more seriously</span>
				<span class='text'>Though he took odd jobs to support himself in 1955 upon the advice of a psychiatrist Ginsberg dropped out of the working world to devote his entire life to poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after he wrote Howl the poem that brought him and his friends much fame and allowed him to live as a professional poet for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Later in life Ginsberg entered academia teaching poetry as Distinguished Professor of English at  from 1986 until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>ince Ginsbergs poetry is intensely personal and since much of the vitality of those associated with the  comes from mutual inspiration much credit for style inspiration and content can be given to Ginsbergs friends</span>
				<span class='text'>insberg claimed throughout his life that his biggest inspiration was Kerouacs concept of spontaneous prose</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed literature should come from the soul without conscious restrictions</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg was much more prone to revise than Kerouac</span>
				<span class='text'>For example when Kerouac saw the first draft of Howl he disliked the fact that Ginsberg had made editorial changes in pencil transposing negro and angry in the first line for example</span>
				<span class='text'>Kerouac only wrote out his concepts of Spontaneous Prose at Ginsbergs insistence because Ginsberg wanted to learn how to apply the technique to his poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>name Miles The inspiration for Howl was Ginsbergs friend  and Howl is dedicated to Solomon whom Ginsberg also directly addresses in the third section of the poem</span>
				<span class='text'>Solomon was a  and  enthusiast he introduced Ginsberg to  who suffered bouts of depression</span>
				<span class='text'>Solomon wanted to commit suicide but he thought a form of suicide appropriate to dadaism would be to go to a mental institution and demand a lobotomy</span>
				<span class='text'>The institution used giving him many forms of  including </span>
				<span class='text'>Much of the final section of the first part of Howl is a description of this</span>

				<span class='text'>Moloch to whom the second section is addressed is a  to whom children were sacrificed</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg may have gotten the name from the  poem Thou Shalt Not Kill a poem about the death of one of Ginsbergs heroes </span>
				<span class='text'>Moloch is mentioned a few times in the  and erences to Ginsbergs Jewish background are not infrequent in his work</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg said the image of Moloch was inspired by  visions he had of the Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco which appeared to him as a skull he took it as a symbol of the city not specifically San Francisco but all cities</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg later acknowledged in various publications and interviews that behind the visions of the Francis Drake Hotel were memories of the Moloch of s film  1927 and of the woodcut novels of </span>

				<span class='text'>Ward also illustrated a later broadside version of Howl which can be seen in the cited pages</span>
				<span class='text'> Moloch has subsequently been interpreted as any system of control including the conformist society of post‚ÄìWorld War II America focused on material gain which Ginsberg frequently blamed for the destruction of all those outside of societal norms</span>
				<span class='text'>name Miles He also made sure to emphasize that Moloch is a part of all of us the decision to defy socially created systems of control‚Äîand theore go against Moloch‚Äîis a form of self destruction</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the characters Ginsberg erences in Howl such as Neal Cassady and Herbert Huncke destroyed themselves through excessive substance abuse or a generally wild lifestyle</span>
				<span class='text'>The personal aspects of Howl are perhaps as important as the political aspects</span>
				<span class='text'>Carl Solomon the prime example of a best mind destroyed by defying society is associated with Ginsbergs schizophrenic mother the line with mother finally  fucked comes after a long section about Carl Solomon and in Part III Ginsberg says Im with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg later admitted that the drive to write Howl was fueled by sympathy for his ailing mother an issue which he was not yet ready to deal with directly</span>
				<span class='text'>He dealt with it directly with 1959s Kaddish name Miles  which had its first public reading at a  Friday Night meeting possibly due to its associations with </span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsbergs poetry was strongly influenced by  most importantly the American style of Modernism pioneered by William Carlos Williams  specifically William Blake and  the beat and cadence of  specifically that of  musicians such as  and his   practice and Jewish background</span>
				<span class='text'>He considered himself to have inherited the visionary poetic mantle handed down from the English poet and artist William Blake the American poet Walt Whitman and the Spanish poet </span>
				<span class='text'>The power of Ginsbergs verse its searching probing focus its long and lilting lines as well as its  exuberance all echo the continuity of inspiration that he claimed</span>
				<span class='text'>name Miles  name Deliberate  name Spontaneous He corresponded with William Carlos Williams who was then in the middle of writing his epic poem  about the industrial city near his home</span>
				<span class='text'>After attending a reading by Williams Ginsberg sent the older poet several of his poems and wrote an introductory letter</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of these early poems were rhymed and metered and included archaic pronouns like thee</span>
				<span class='text'>Williams disliked the poems and told Ginsberg In this mode perfection is basic and these poems are not perfect</span>
				<span class='text'>name Miles  name Deliberate  name Spontaneous Though he disliked these early poems Williams loved the exuberance in Ginsbergs letter</span>
				<span class='text'>He included the letter in a later part of Paterson</span>
				<span class='text'>He encouraged Ginsberg not to emulate the old masters but to speak with his own voice and the voice of the common American</span>
				<span class='text'>From Williams Ginsberg learned to focus on strong visual images in line with Williams own motto No ideas but in things</span>
				<span class='text'>Studying Williams style led to a tremendous shift from the early formalist work to a loose colloquial free verse style</span>
				<span class='text'>Early breakthrough poems include Bricklayers Lunch Hour and Dream Record</span>
				<span class='text'>name Miles  name Spontaneous Carl Solomon introduced Ginsberg to the work of Antonin Artaud To Have Done with the Judgement of God and Van Gogh The Man Suicided by Society and Jean Genet Our Lady of the Flowers</span>
				<span class='text'> introduced him to other  and Surrealism continued to be an influence for example sections of Kaddish were inspired by s Free Union</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg claimed that the anaphoric repetition of Howl and other poems was inspired by Christopher Smart in such poems as Jubilate Agno</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg also claimed other more traditional influences such as     and even </span>
				<span class='text'>name Miles  name Deliberate Ginsberg also made an intense study of  and the paintings of  from which he adapted a concept important to his work which he called the Eyeball Kick</span>
				<span class='text'>He noticed in viewing C√©zannes paintings that when the eye moved from one color to a contrasting color the eye would  or kick</span>
				<span class='text'>Likewise he discovered that the contrast of two seeming opposites was a common feature in haiku</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg used this technique in his poetry putting together two starkly dissimilar images something weak with something strong an artifact of high culture with an artifact of low culture something holy with something unholy</span>
				<span class='text'>The example Ginsberg most often used was hydrogen jukebox which later became the title of a  composed by  with lyrics drawn from Ginsbergs poems</span>
				<span class='text'>Another example is Ginsbergs observation on Bob Dylan during Dylans hectic and intense 1966 electric guitar tour fuelled by a cocktail of amphetamines  opiates  alcohol  and psychedelics  as a  Clown</span>
				<span class='text'>The phrases eyeball kick and hydrogen jukebox both show up in Howl as well as a direct quote from C√©zanne Pater Omnipotens Aeterna Deus</span>
				<span class='text'>name Deliberate Allen Ginsberg also found inspiration in music</span>
				<span class='text'>He frequently included music in his poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote and recorded music to accompany William Blake‚Äôs Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience</span>
				<span class='text'>He also recorded a hand full of other albums</span>
				<span class='text'>To create music for Howl and Wichita Vortex Sutra he worked with the neo classical composer Philip Glass</span>
				<span class='text'>insberg has worked with inspired and drew inspiration from artists such as Bob Dylan Paul McCartney The Clash Patti Smith Phil Ochs and The Fugs</span>

				<span class='text'> Howl came out during a potentially hostile literary environment less welcoming to non traditional free verse poetry there was a renewed focus on form and structure among academic poets and critics partly inspired by </span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently Ginsberg often had to defend his choice to employ long free verse lines often citing Whitmans free verse used in Leaves of Grass as a precursor</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg claimed Whitmans long line was a dynamic technique few other poets had ventured to develop further and Whitman is also often compared to Ginsberg because their poetry sexualized aspects of the male form</span>
				<span class='text'>name Miles  name Deliberate  name Spontaneous Ginsberg believed strongly that traditional formalist considerations were archaic and did not apply to reality</span>
				<span class='text'>Though some critics like Diana Trilling have pointed to Ginsbergs occasional use of meter for example the anapest of who came back to Denver and waited in vain Ginsberg denied any intention toward meter and claimed instead that his idea of meter followed the natural poetic voice</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg said that he learned from William Carlos Williams that natural speech is occasionally dactylic so poetry that imitates natural speech will sometimes fall into a dactylic structure but only accidentally</span>
				<span class='text'>Like Williams Ginsbergs line breaks were often determined by breath one line in Howl for example should be read in one breath</span>
				<span class='text'>Ginsberg claimed he developed such a long line because he had long breaths</span>
				<span class='text'>any of Ginsbergs early long line experiments contain some sort of  repetition of a fixed base for example who in Howl America in America and this has become a recognizable feature of Ginsbergs style</span>
				<span class='text'> He said later this was a crutch because he lacked confidence he did not yet trust free flight</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1960s after employing it in some sections of Kaddish caw for example he for the most part abandoned the anaphoric form</span>
				<span class='text'>name Deliberate  name Spontaneous Several of his earlier experiments with methods for formatting poems as a whole became regular aspects of his style in later poems</span>
				<span class='text'>In the original draft of Howl each line is in a stepped triadic format reminiscent of </span>
				<span class='text'>But he abandoned the stepped triadic when he developed his long line although the stepped lines showed up later most significantly in the travelogues of The Fall of America</span>
				<span class='text'>Howl and Kaddish arguably his two most important poems are both organized as an inverted pyramid with larger sections leading to smaller sections</span>
				<span class='text'>In America he also experimented with a mix of longer and shorter lines</span>
				<span class='text'>name Deliberate  name Spontaneous In Howl and in his other poetry Ginsberg drew inspiration from the   style of the 19th century American poet </span>
				<span class='text'>insberg Allen Deliberate Prose pp</span>
				<span class='text'>285‚Äì331</span>
				<span class='text'> Both wrote passionately about the promise and betrayal of American democracy the central importance of erotic experience and the spiritual quest for the truth of everyday existence</span>
				<span class='text'> editor of the  called Ginsberg the best known American poet of his generation as much a social force as a literary phenomenon</span>
				<span class='text'>McClatchy added that Ginsberg like Whitman was a bard in the old manner ‚Äì outsized darkly prophetic part exuberance part prayer part rant</span>
				<span class='text'>His work is finally a history of our eras psyche with all its contradictory urges</span>
				<span class='text'>McClatchys barbed eulogies define the essential difference between Ginsberg a beat poet whose writing was </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>journalism raised by combining the recycling genius with a generous mimic empathy to strike audience accessible chords always lyrical and sometimes truly poetic and Kerouac a poet of singular brilliance the brightest luminary of a beat generation he came to symbolise in popular culture</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>though in reality he far surpassed his contemporaries</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Kerouac is an originating genius exploring then answering   like Rimbaud a century earlier by necessity more than by choice   the demands of authentic self expression as applied to the evolving quicksilver mind of Americas only literary virtuoso</span>
