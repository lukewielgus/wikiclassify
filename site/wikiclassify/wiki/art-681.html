				<span class='text'> As the mother of three sons who became kings of France during her lifetime she had extensive, if at times varying, influence in the political life of France</span>
				<span class='text'> For a time she ruled France as its [[regent]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1533, at the age of fourteen, Caterina married Henry, second son of [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]] and [[Claude of France|Queen Claude of France]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the [[Francization|gallicised]] version of her name, '''Catherine de Médicis''',&lt;ref&gt;{{IPA-fr|katʁin də medisis}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was [[List of French consorts|Queen consort of France]] as the wife of King [[Henry II of France]] from 1547 to 1559</span>
				<span class='text'>Throughout his reign, Henry excluded Catherine from participating in state affairs and instead showered favours on his chief mistress, [[Diane de Poitiers]], who wielded much influence over him</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry's death thrust Catherine into the political arena as mother of the frail fifteen-year-old King [[Francis II of France|Francis II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When he died in 1560, she became [[regent]] on behalf of her ten-year-old son [[Charles IX of France|King Charles IX]] and was granted sweeping powers</span>
				<span class='text'>After Charles died in 1574, Catherine played a key role in the reign of her third son, [[Henry III of France|Henry III]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He dispensed with her advice only in the last months of her life</span>
				<span class='text'>atherine's three sons reigned in an age of almost constant civil and religious war in France</span>
				<span class='text'>The problems facing the monarchy were complex and daunting but Catherine was able to keep the monarchy and the state institutions functioning even at a minimum level</span>
				<span class='text'>At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Protestants, or [[Huguenot]]s, as they became known</span>
				<span class='text'>She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, she resorted in frustration and anger to hard-line policies against them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 272</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of 1572, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed in Paris and throughout France</span>
				<span class='text'>ome historians have excused Catherine from blame for the worst decisions of the crown, though evidence for her ruthlessness can be found in her letters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 272</span>
				<span class='text'>For a summary of the fluctuations in Catherine's historical reputation, see the preface to R</span>
				<span class='text'>J</span>
				<span class='text'>Knecht's ''Catherine de' Medici'', 1998: xi–xiv</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In practice, her authority was always limited by the effects of the civil wars</span>
				<span class='text'>Her policies, therefore, may be seen as desperate measures to keep the [[House of Valois|Valois monarchy]] on the throne at all costs, and her  patronage of the arts as an attempt to glorify a monarchy whose prestige was in steep decline</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Without Catherine, it is unlikely that her sons would have remained in power</span>

				<span class='text'>531</span>
				<span class='text'>Clement called Catherine's betrothal to [[Henry II of France|Henry of Orléans]] &quot;the greatest match in the world&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;Fxxxv&quot;&gt;Frieda, 35</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]Catherine was born in [[Florence]], [[Republic of Florence]], as '''Caterina Maria Romula di Lorenzo de' Medici'''</span>
				<span class='text'>he Medici  family were at the time the ''de facto'' rulers of [[republic of Florence|Florence]]: originally bankers, they came to great wealth and power by bankrolling the monarchies of Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Catherine's father, [[Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino|Lorenzo II de' Medici]], was made [[Duke of Urbino]] by his uncle [[Pope Leo X]], and the title reverted to [[Francesco Maria I della Rovere]] after Lorenzo's death</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, even though her father was a duke, Catherine was of relatively low birth</span>
				<span class='text'>However her mother, [[Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne]], the Countess of Boulogne, was from one of the most [[House of La Tour d'Auvergne|prominent and ancient French noble families]]; this prestigious maternal heritage was of benefit to her future marriage to a ''[[fils de France]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to a contemporary chronicler, when Catherine de' Medici was born, her parents, were &quot;as pleased as if it had been a boy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Goro Gheri, 15 April 1519, quoted by Frieda, 14</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Madeleine died on 28 April of [[puerperal fever]] or [[plague (disease)|plague]], and Lorenzo died on 4 May</span>
				<span class='text'>The young couple were married the year before at [[Amboise]] as part of the alliance between King [[Francis I of France]] and Pope Leo against the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I]]</span>
				<span class='text'>King Francis wanted Catherine to be raised at the French court, but Pope Leo had other plans for her</span>
				<span class='text'>He intended to marry her to his brother's illegitimate son, [[Ippolito de' Medici]], and set them up to rule Florence</span>
				<span class='text'>atherine was first cared for by her paternal grandmother, Alfonsina Orsini (wife of [[Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]])</span>
				<span class='text'>After Alfonsina's death in 1520, Catherine joined her cousins and was raised by her aunt, [[Clarice de' Medici|Clarice Strozzi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The death of Pope Leo in 1521 interrupted Medici power briefly, until Cardinal Giulio de' Medici was elected [[Pope Clement VII]] in 1523</span>
				<span class='text'>Clement housed Catherine in the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]] in Florence, where she lived in state</span>
				<span class='text'>The Florentine people called her ''duchessina'' (&quot;the little duchess&quot;), in deference to her unrecognised claim to the [[Duchy of Urbino]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 23–24</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, ''The Medici: Volume II'', 15</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1527, the Medici were overthrown in Florence by a faction opposed to the regime of Clement's representative, Cardinal [[Silvio Passerini]], and Catherine was taken hostage and placed in a series of convents</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The final one, the ''Santissima Annuziata delle Murate'' was her home for three years</span>
				<span class='text'>Mark Strage described these years as &quot;the happiest of her entire life&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;strage13&quot;&gt;Strage, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>13, 15&lt;/ref&gt; Clement had no choice but to crown [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] Holy Roman Emperor in return for his help in retaking the city</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 10–11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In October 1529, Charles's troops laid [[Siege of Florence (1529–1530)|siege to Florence]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As the siege dragged on, voices called for Catherine to be killed and exposed naked and chained to the city walls</span>
				<span class='text'>Some even suggested that she be handed over to the troops to be used for their sexual gratification</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;strage15&quot;&gt;Strage, p</span>
				<span class='text'>5&lt;/ref&gt; The city finally surrendered on 12 August 1530</span>
				<span class='text'>Clement summoned Catherine from her beloved convent to join him in Rome where he greeted her with open arms and tears in his eyes</span>
				<span class='text'>Then he set about the business of finding her a husband</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name= &quot;kxii&quot;&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Marriage==[[File:Henri &amp; Catherine</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Catherine and Henry's marriage, painted seventeen years after the event]]On her visit to Rome, the Venetian envoy described Catherine as &quot;small of stature, and thin, and without delicate features, but having the protruding eyes peculiar to the Medici family&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 31; Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>14</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Suitors, however, lined up for her hand, including [[James V of Scotland]] who sent the [[John Stewart, Duke of Albany|Duke of Albany]] to Clement to conclude a marriage in April and November 1530</span>

				<span class='text'> ''The Letters of James V'', HMSO (1954), p</span>
				<span class='text'>73, 180–2, 189,&lt;/ref&gt; When Francis I of France proposed his second son, [[Henry II of France|Henry, Duke of Orléans]], in early 1533, Clement jumped at the offer</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry was a prize catch for Catherine, who despite her wealth was from commoner origins</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Fxxxv&quot;/&gt;The wedding, a grand affair marked by extravagant display and gift-giving,&lt;ref name=friedaandknecht/&gt; took place in the [[Église Saint-Ferréol les Augustins]] in [[Marseille]] on 28 October 1533</span>

				<span class='text'> The contract was signed on the 27th and the religious ceremony took place the next day</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Prince Henry danced and [[jousting|jousted]] for Catherine</span>
				<span class='text'>The fourteen-year-old couple left their wedding ball at midnight to perform their nuptial duties</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry arrived in the bedroom with King Francis, who is said to have stayed until the marriage was consummated</span>
				<span class='text'>He noted that &quot;each had shown valour in the joust&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=friedaandknecht&gt;Frieda, 53; Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 16</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Clement visited the newlyweds in bed the next morning and added his blessings to the night's proceedings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 53</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Catherine saw little of her husband in their first year of marriage, but the ladies of the court treated her well, impressed with her intelligence and keenness to please</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 54</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The death of Pope Clement VII on 25 September 1534, however, undermined Catherine's standing in the French court</span>
				<span class='text'>The next pope, [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]], broke the alliance with France and refused to pay her huge dowry</span>
				<span class='text'>King Francis lamented, &quot;The girl has come to me stark naked</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''J'ai reçu la fille toute nue</span>
				<span class='text'>'&quot; Frieda, 54</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Prince Henry showed no interest in Catherine as a wife; instead, he openly took mistresses</span>
				<span class='text'>For the first ten years of the marriage, Catherine failed to produce any children</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1537, on the other hand, [[Filippa Duci|Philippa Duci]], one of Henry's mistresses, gave birth to a daughter, whom he publicly acknowledged</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 29–30</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry legitimised the child under the name [[Diane de France]]; he also produced at least two sons by other women</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This proved that Henry was fertile and added to the pressure on Catherine to produce a child</span>
				<span class='text'>==Dauphine===[[File:Henry II, king of France</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|170px|right|[[Henry II of France|Henry, Duke of Orléans]], by [[Corneille de Lyon]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During his childhood, Henry spent almost four and a half years as a hostage in Spain, an ordeal that marked him for life, leaving him introverted and gloomy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 45</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]In 1536, Henry's older brother, [[Francis, Dauphin of France (1518-1536)|Francis]], caught a chill after a game of tennis, contracted a fever, and died, leaving Henry the heir</span>
				<span class='text'>As [[Dauphine of France|Dauphine]], Catherine was now expected to provide a future heir to the throne</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;kxxiv&quot;&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 29</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to the court chronicler [[Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brantôme|Brantôme]], &quot;many people advised the king and the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] to repudiate her, since it was necessary to continue the line of France&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 29</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Divorce was discussed</span>
				<span class='text'>In desperation, Catherine tried every known trick for getting pregnant, such as placing cow dung and ground stags' antlers on her &quot;source of life&quot;, and drinking mule's urine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 67</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; On 19 January 1544, she at last gave birth to a [[Francis II of France|son]], named after King Francis</span>
				<span class='text'>fter becoming pregnant once, Catherine had no trouble doing so again</span>
				<span class='text'>She may have owed her change of luck to the physician [[Jean Fernel]], who had noticed slight abnormalities in the couple's sexual organs and advised them how to solve the problem</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 68</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Catherine quickly conceived again and on 2 April 1545 she bore a daughter, [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elisabeth]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She went on to bear Henry a further eight children, six of whom survived infancy, including the future [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] (born 27 June 1550); the future [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (born 19 September 1551); and [[Francis, Duke of Anjou]] (born 18 March 1555)</span>
				<span class='text'>The long-term future of the [[House of Valois|Valois dynasty]], which had ruled France since the 14th century, seemed assured</span>
				<span class='text'>atherine's new-found ability to bear children, however, failed to improve her marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1538, at the age of nineteen, Henry had taken as his mistress the thirty-eight-year-old [[Diane de Poitiers]], whom he adored for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 60, 95; Heritier, 38–42</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Even so, he respected Catherine's status as his consort</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 114, 132</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When King Francis I died in 1547 Catherine became queen consort of France</span>
				<span class='text'>She was crowned in the [[Basilique Saint-Denis|basilica of Saint-Denis]] on 10 June 1549</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Henry gave the [[Château de Chenonceau|Château of Chenonceau]], which Catherine had wanted for herself, to Diane de Poitiers, who took her place at the centre of power, dispensing patronage and accepting favours</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Diane never regarded Catherine as a threat</span>

				<span class='text'>At times he even felt well enough to dictate letters and listen to music</span>
				<span class='text'>Slowly, however, he lost his sight, speech, and reason, and on 10 July 1559 he died</span>
				<span class='text'>From that day, Catherine took a broken lance as her emblem, inscribed with the words &quot;''lacrymae hinc, hinc dolor''&quot; (&quot;from this come my tears and my pain&quot;), and wore black [[mourning]] in memory of Henry</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]][[Francis II of France|Francis II]] became king at the age of fifteen</span>
				<span class='text'>In what has been called a ''[[coup d'état]]'', the Cardinal of Lorraine and the [[Francis, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]]—whose niece, Mary, Queen of Scots, had married Francis the year before—seized power the day after Henry II's death and quickly moved themselves into the [[Louvre Palace]] with the young couple</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 59; Frieda, 140</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The English ambassador reported a few days later that &quot;the house of Guise ruleth and doth all about the French king&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 60</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For the moment, Catherine worked with the Guises out of necessity</span>
				<span class='text'>She was not strictly entitled to a role in Francis's government, because he was deemed old enough to rule for himself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Morris, 248</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, all his official acts began with the words: &quot;This being the good pleasure of the Queen, my lady-mother, and I also approving of every opinion that she holdeth, am content and command that&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 146</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Catherine did not hesitate to exploit her new authority</span>
				<span class='text'>One of her first acts was to force Diane de Poitiers to hand over the crown jewels and return the [[Château de Chenonceau]] to the crown</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Frieda, 144&quot;&gt;Frieda, 144</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She later did her best to efface or outdo Diane's building work there</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Frieda, 144&quot;/&gt;The Guise brothers set about persecuting the Protestants with zeal</span>
				<span class='text'>Catherine adopted a moderate stance and spoke up against the Guise persecutions, though she had no particular sympathy for the Huguenots, whose beliefs she never shared</span>
				<span class='text'>The Protestants looked for leadership first to [[Antoine of Navarre|Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre]], the [[First Prince of the Blood]], and then, with more success, to his brother, [[Louis, Prince of Condé (1530–1569)|Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condé]], who backed a plot to overthrow the Guises by force</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 154; Holt, 38–39</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When the Guises heard of the plot,&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 64; Holt, 44</span>
				<span class='text'>The incident was known later as the [[Amboise conspiracy|&quot;tumult&quot; or conspiracy of Amboise]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; they moved the court to the fortified [[Château d'Amboise|Château of Amboise]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Duke of Guise launched an attack into the woods around the château</span>
				<span class='text'>His troops surprised the rebels and killed many of them on the spot, including the commander, La Renaudie</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Renaissance France'', 282</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Others they drowned in the river or strung up around the battlements while Catherine and the court watched</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 65–66</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In June 1560, [[Michel de l'Hôpital]] was appointed [[List of Justice Ministers of France|Chancellor of France]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He sought the support of France's constitutional bodies and worked closely with Catherine to defend the law in the face of the growing anarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Ancien Régime'', 32</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Neither saw the need to punish Protestants who worshipped in private and did not take up arms</span>
				<span class='text'>On 20 August 1560, Catherine and the chancellor advocated this policy to an assembly of notables at [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Historians regard the occasion as an early example of Catherine's statesmanship</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, Condé raised an army and in autumn 1560 began attacking towns in the south</span>
				<span class='text'>Catherine ordered him to court and had him imprisoned as soon as he arrived</span>
				<span class='text'>He was tried in November, found guilty of offences against the crown, and sentenced to death</span>
				<span class='text'>His life was saved by the illness and death of the king, as a result of an infection or an [[abscess]] in his ear</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 151; Knecht, 72; Guy, 119</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;When Catherine had realized Francis was going to die, she made a pact with Antoine de Bourbon by which he would renounce his right to the regency of the future king, [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], in return for the release of his brother Condé</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, 154; Hoogvliet, 105</span>
				<span class='text'>The regency was traditionally the preserve of the princes of the blood</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As a result, when Francis died on 5 December 1560, the Privy Council appointed Catherine as governor of France (''gouvernante de France''), with sweeping powers</span>
				<span class='text'>She wrote to her daughter Elisabeth: &quot;My principal aim is to have the honour of God before my eyes in all things and to preserve my authority, not for myself, but for the conservation of this kingdom and for the good of all your brothers&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>The Venetian ambassador Giovanni Michiel described Charles as &quot;an admirable child, with fine eyes, gracious movements, though he is not robust</span>
				<span class='text'>He favours physical exercise that is too violent for his health, for he suffers from shortness of breath&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Frieda, 203</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]At first Catherine kept the nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close to her, and slept in his chamber</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda,  178, 180</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She presided over his council, decided policy, and controlled state business and patronage</span>
				<span class='text'>However, she was never in a position to control the country as a whole, which was on the brink of civil war</span>
				<span class='text'>In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown</span>
				<span class='text'>The challenges Catherine faced were complex and in some ways difficult for her to comprehend as a foreigner</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Ancien Régime'', 28</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;She summoned church leaders from both sides to attempt to solve their doctrinal differences</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite her optimism, the resulting [[Colloquy of Poissy]] ended in failure on 13 October 1561, dissolving itself without her permission</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Manetsch, 22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Catherine failed because she saw the religious divide only in political terms</span>
				<span class='text'>In the words of historian R</span>
				<span class='text'>J</span>
				<span class='text'>Knecht, &quot;she underestimated the strength of religious conviction, imagining that all would be well if only she could get the party leaders to agree&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 80</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In January 1562, Catherine issued the tolerant [[Edict of Saint-Germain]] in a further attempt to build bridges with the Protestants</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Renaissance France'', 311; Sutherland, ''Ancien Régime'', 11–12</span>
				<span class='text'>The edict, also known as the Edict of Toleration and the Edict of January, was significant for effectively recognising the existence of Protestant churches and permitting their worship outside city walls</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 1562, however, in an incident known as the [[Massacre of Vassy]], the Duke of Guise and his men attacked worshipping Huguenots in a barn at [[Wassy|Vassy (Wassy)]], killing 74 and wounding 104</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 87; Frieda, 188</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Guise, who called the massacre &quot;a regrettable accident&quot;, was cheered as a hero in the streets of Paris while the Huguenots called for revenge</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda,  188–89</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The massacre lit the fuse that sparked the [[French Wars of Religion]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For the next thirty years, France found itself in a state of either civil war or armed truce</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 140</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Within a month [[Louis, Prince of Condé (1530–1569)|Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condé]], and [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Admiral Gaspard de Coligny]] had raised an army of 1,800</span>
				<span class='text'>They formed an alliance with England and seized town after town in France</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 191</span>
				<span class='text'>The rebels signed the [[Treaty of Hampton Court (1562)|Treaty of Hampton Court]] with [[Elizabeth I of England]], giving her [[Le Havre]] (to be exchanged later for [[Calais]]), in return for her support</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Catherine met Coligny, but he refused to back down</span>
				<span class='text'>She therefore told him: &quot;Since you rely on your forces, we will show you ours&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 89</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  The royal army struck back quickly and laid siege to Huguenot-held [[Rouen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Catherine visited the deathbed of [[Antoine of Navarre|Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre]], after he was fatally wounded by an [[arquebus]] shot</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 192–93</span>
				<span class='text'>His wife, [[Jeanne d'Albret]], remained [[queen regnant]] of Navarre; and her eight-year-old son [[Henry IV of France|Henry]] became First Prince of the Blood</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Catherine insisted on visiting the field herself and when warned of the dangers laughed, &quot;My courage is as great as yours&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 90</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Catholics took Rouen, but their triumph was short lived</span>
				<span class='text'>On 18 February 1563, a spy called [[Jean de Poltrot|Poltrot de Méré]] fired an arquebus into the back of the [[Claude, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]], at the siege of Orléans</span>
				<span class='text'>The murder triggered an aristocratic [[feud|blood feud]] that complicated the French civil wars for years to come</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 91; Carroll, 126; Sutherland, ''Ancien Régime'', 17</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Catherine, however, was delighted with the death of her ally</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;If Monsieur de Guise had perished sooner&quot;, she told the Venetian ambassador, &quot;peace would have been achieved more quickly&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 91–92</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; On 19 March 1563, the [[Edict of Amboise]], also known as the Edict of Pacification, ended the war</span>
				<span class='text'>Catherine now rallied both Huguenot and Catholic forces to retake [[Le Havre]] from the English</span>
				<span class='text'>===Huguenots====On 17 August 1563, Charles IX was declared of age at the [[Parlement]] of Rouen, but he was never able to rule on his own and showed little interest in government</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 268; Sutherland, ''Ancien Régime'', 20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Catherine decided to launch a drive to enforce the [[Edict of Amboise]] and revive loyalty to the crown</span>
				<span class='text'>To this end, she set out with Charles and the court on a [[royal entry|progress]] around France that lasted from January 1564 until May 1565</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Ancien Régime'', 15</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Catherine held talks with the Protestant Queen [[Jeanne III of Navarre]] at [[Mâcon]] and [[Nérac]]</span>
				<span class='text'>She also met her daughter [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elisabeth]] at [[Bayonne]] near the Spanish border, amidst lavish [[Catherine de' Medici's court festivals|court festivities]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] excused himself from the occasion</span>
				<span class='text'>He sent the [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] to tell Catherine to scrap the Edict of Amboise and to find punitive solutions to the problem of heresy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 104, 107–8; Frieda, 224</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1566, through the ambassador to the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Guillaume de Grandchamp de Grantrie]], and because of a long-standing [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]], [[Charles IX of France]] and Catherine de Medicis proposed to the Ottoman Court a plan to resettle French [[Huguenots]] and French and German [[Lutherans]] in Ottoman-controlled [[Moldavia]], in order to create a military colony and a buffer against the [[Habsburg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This plan also had the added advantage of removing the Huguenots from [[France]], but it failed to interest the Ottomans</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Taken unawares, the court fled to Paris in disarray</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 234; Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 147</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The war was ended by the [[Peace of Longjumeau]] of 22–23 March 1568, but civil unrest and bloodshed continued</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 239; Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 118</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The [[Surprise of Meaux]] marked a turning point in Catherine's policy towards the Huguenots</span>
				<span class='text'>From that moment, she abandoned compromise for a policy of repression</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 120</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She told the Venetian ambassador in June 1568 that all one could expect from Huguenots was deceit, and she praised the Duke of Alba's reign of terror in the Netherlands, where [[Calvinist]]s and rebels were put to death in the thousands</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; &quot;We have come to the determination to die, all of us&quot;, Jeanne wrote to Catherine, &quot;rather than abandon our God, and our religion&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 132</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Catherine called Jeanne, whose decision to rebel posed a dynastic threat to the Valois, &quot;the most shameless woman in the world&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 241</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the [[Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], signed on 8 August 1570 because the royal army ran out of cash, conceded wider toleration to the Huguenots than ever before</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wood, 28</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Catherine looked to further Valois interests by grand dynastic marriages</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1570, Charles IX married [[Elisabeth of Austria (1554-1592)|Elisabeth of Austria]], daughter of [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]]</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1579, François, Duke of Alençon, visited Elizabeth, who affectionately dubbed him &quot;her frog&quot; but, as always, proved elusive</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After Catherine's daughter Elisabeth died in childbirth in 1568, she had touted her youngest daughter [[Margaret of Valois|Margaret]] as a bride for [[Philip II of Spain]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Now she sought a marriage between Margaret and [[Henry III of Navarre]], with the aim of uniting Valois and Bourbon interests</span>
				<span class='text'>Margaret, however, was secretly involved with [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Henry of Guise]], the son of the late Duke of Guise</span>
				<span class='text'>When Catherine found this out, she had her daughter brought from her bed</span>
				<span class='text'>Catherine and the king then beat her, ripping her nightclothes and pulling out handfuls of her hair</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 257; Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 135</span>

				<span class='text'>Jeanne replied: &quot;Pardon me if, reading that, I want to laugh, because you want to relieve me of a fear that I've never had</span>
				<span class='text'>I've never thought that, as they say, you eat little children&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bryson, 282</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When Jeanne did come to court, Catherine pressured her hard,&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne d'Albret wrote to her son, Henry: &quot;I am not free to talk with either the King or Madame, only the Queen Mother, who goads me [''me traite á la fourche'']&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; playing on Jeanne's hopes for her beloved son</span>
				<span class='text'>Jeanne finally agreed to the marriage between her son and Margaret, so long as Henry could remain a Huguenot</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A smoking arquebus was discovered in a window, but the culprit had made his escape from the rear of the building on a waiting horse</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 254, 304–5; Holt, 83</span>
				<span class='text'>The investigators traced the house and horse to the Guises and claimed to have found evidence that the would-be killer was [[Charles de Louviers de Maurevert]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Coligny was carried to his lodgings at the Hôtel de Béthisy, where the surgeon [[Ambroise Paré]] removed a bullet from his elbow and amputated a damaged finger with a pair of scissors</span>
				<span class='text'>Catherine, who was said to have received the news without emotion, made a tearful visit to Coligny and promised to punish his attacker</span>
				<span class='text'>Many historians have blamed Catherine for the attack on Coligny</span>
				<span class='text'>Others point to the Guise family or a Spanish-papal plot to end Coligny's influence on the king</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 154–57</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The [[St</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pettegree, 154&quot;/&gt; There is no reason to believe she was not party to the decision when on 23 August Charles IX ordered, &quot;Then kill them all! Kill them all!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Holt, 84</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;br /&gt;• [[Gaspard de Saulx|Marshal Tavannes]] recalled that Catherine had summoned a war council in the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries Gardens]] (so as not to be overheard) to plan the next move: &quot;Because the attempt on the Admiral would cause a war, she, and the rest of us, agreed that it would be advisable to bring battle in Paris&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> It is almost certain, however, that when Charles gave the order &quot;Kill them all!&quot;, he meant those drawn up on a list by Catherine, and not, as has often been claimed, all Huguenots</span>
				<span class='text'>Frieda, 306–8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The thinking was clear</span>
				<span class='text'>Catherine and her advisers expected a Huguenot uprising to avenge the attack on Coligny</span>
				<span class='text'>They chose therefore to strike first and wipe out the Huguenot leaders while they were still in Paris after the wedding</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holt, 84</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The slaughter in Paris lasted for almost a week</span>
				<span class='text'>It spread to many parts of France, where it persisted into the autumn</span>
				<span class='text'>In the words of historian [[Jules Michelet]], &quot;St Bartholomew was not a day, but a season&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Morris, 252</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; On 29 September, when Navarre knelt before the altar as a Roman Catholic, having converted to avoid being killed, Catherine turned to the ambassadors and laughed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 324</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; From this time dates the legend of the wicked Italian queen</span>
				<span class='text'>Huguenot writers branded Catherine a scheming Italian, who had acted on [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s principles to kill all enemies in one blow</span>

				<span class='text'>As [[Henry III of France|Henry III]], he often showed more interest in pious devotions than in government</span>
				<span class='text'>]===Reign of Henry III===Two years later, Catherine faced a new crisis with the death of Charles IX at the age of twenty-three</span>
				<span class='text'>His dying words were &quot;oh, my mother&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 350</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The day before he died, he named Catherine regent, since his brother and heir, Henry the Duke of Anjou, was in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], where he had been elected [[List of Polish monarchs#Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|king]] the year before</span>
				<span class='text'>However, three months after his coronation at [[Wawel Cathedral]], Henry abandoned that throne and returned to France in order to become king of France</span>
				<span class='text'> Catherine wrote to Henry of Charles IX's death: &quot;I am grief-stricken to have witnessed such a scene and the love which he showed me at the end&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>My only consolation is to see you here soon, as your kingdom requires, and in good health, for if I were to lose you, I would have myself buried alive with you</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Henry was Catherine's favourite son</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike his brothers, he came to the throne as a grown man</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also healthier, though he suffered from weak lungs and constant fatigue</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 375</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His interest in the tasks of government, however, proved fitful</span>
				<span class='text'>He depended on Catherine and her team of secretaries until the last few weeks of her life</span>
				<span class='text'>He often hid from state affairs, immersing himself in acts of piety, such as [[pilgrimage]]s and [[flagellation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 232, 240, 247</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, also famous for his circle of favorites, called Les Mignons (from ''mignon'', French for &quot;the darlings&quot; or &quot;the dainty ones&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a term used by polemicists in the toxic atmosphere of the French Wars of Religion and taken up by the people of Paris, to designate the favourites of Henry III of France, from his return from Poland to reign in France in 1574, to his assassination in 1589, a disastrous end to which the perception of effeminate weakness contributed</span>
				<span class='text'>1] The mignons were frivolous and fashionable young men, to whom public malignity attributed heterodox sexuality, rumors that some historians have found to be a factor in the disintegration of the late Valois monarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to the contemporary chronicler Pierre de l'Estoile,[2] they made themselves &quot;exceedingly odious, as much by their foolish and haughty demeanour, as by their effeminate and immodest dress, but above all by the immense gifts the king made to them</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The [[Anne de Joyeuse|Joyeuse]] wedding in 1581 occasioned one of the most extravagant display of the reign</span>
				<span class='text'>enry married [[Louise de Lorraine-Vaudémont]] in February 1575, two days after his coronation</span>
				<span class='text'>His choice thwarted Catherine's plans for a political marriage to a foreign princess</span>
				<span class='text'>Rumours of Henry's inability to produce children were by that time in wide circulation</span>
				<span class='text'>The papal [[nuncio]] Salviati observed, &quot;it is only with difficulty that we can imagine there will be offspring&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>physicians and those who know him well say that he has an extremely weak constitution and will not live long</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 369</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As time passed and the likelihood of children from the marriage receded, Catherine's youngest son, [[Francis, Duke of Anjou|Francis, Duke of Alençon]], known as &quot;Monsieur&quot;, played upon his role as heir to the throne, repeatedly exploiting the anarchy of the civil wars, which were by now as much about noble power struggles as religion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Ancien Régime'', 22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Catherine did all in her power to bring Francis back into the fold</span>
				<span class='text'>On one occasion, in March 1578, she lectured him for six hours about his dangerously subversive behaviour</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 205</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1576, in a move that endangered Henry's throne, Francis allied with the Protestant princes against the crown</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holt, 104</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; On 6 May 1576, Catherine gave in to almost all Huguenot demands in the [[Edict of Beaulieu]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The treaty became known as the ''Peace of Monsieur'' because it was thought that Francis had forced it on the crown</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Holt, 105–6; Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 186; Frieda, 384–87</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Francis died of [[tuberculosis|consumption]] in June 1584, after a disastrous intervention in the Low Countries during which his army had been massacred</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 212–13; Frieda, 406–7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Catherine wrote, the next day: &quot;I am so wretched to live long enough to see so many people die before me, although I realize that God's will must be obeyed, that He owns everything, and that he lends us only for as long as He likes the children whom He gives us</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 217</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The death of her youngest son was a calamity for Catherine's dynastic dreams</span>
				<span class='text'>Under [[Salic law]], by which only males could ascend the throne, the Huguenot Henry of Navarre now became heir presumptive to the French crown</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]Catherine had at least taken the precaution of marrying Margaret, her youngest daughter, to Navarre</span>
				<span class='text'>Margaret, however, became almost as much of a thorn in Catherine's side as Francis, and in 1582, she returned to the French court without her husband</span>
				<span class='text'>Catherine was heard yelling at her for taking lovers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 404</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Catherine sent [[Pomponne de Bellièvre]] to Navarre to arrange Margaret's return</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1585, Margaret fled Navarre again</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 414</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She retreated to her property at [[Agen]] and begged her mother for money</span>
				<span class='text'>Catherine sent her only enough &quot;to put food on her table&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 415</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Moving on to the fortress of Carlat, Margaret took a lover called d'Aubiac</span>
				<span class='text'>Catherine asked Henry to act before Margaret brought shame on them again</span>
				<span class='text'>In October 1586, therefore, he had Margaret locked up in the [[Château d'Usson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>D'Aubiac was executed, though not, despite Catherine's wish, in front of Margaret</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 416; Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 254–55</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Her role in his government became that of chief executive and roving diplomat</span>
				<span class='text'>She travelled widely across the kingdom, enforcing his authority and trying to head off war</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1578, she took on the task of pacifying the south</span>
				<span class='text'>At the age of fifty-nine, she embarked on an eighteen-month journey around the south of France to meet Huguenot leaders face to face</span>
				<span class='text'>Her efforts won Catherine new respect from the French people</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She was under no illusions, however</span>

				<span class='text'>Catherine told him it would be better if he took off his boots and ate something, after which they could talk at length</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 412</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;]]Many leading Roman Catholics were appalled by Catherine's attempts to appease the Huguenots</span>
				<span class='text'>After the Edict of Beaulieu, they had started forming local leagues to protect their religion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 185; Frieda, 386</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The death of the heir to the throne in 1584 prompted the Duke of Guise to assume the leadership of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He planned to block Henry of Navarre's succession and place Henry's Catholic uncle [[Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon|Cardinal Charles de Bourbon]] on the throne instead</span>
				<span class='text'>In this cause, he recruited the great Catholic princes, nobles and prelates, signed the [[treaty of Joinville]] with Spain, and prepared to make war on the &quot;heretics&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; By 1585, Henry III had no choice but to go to war against the League</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 251</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Henry was unable to fight the Catholics and the Protestants at once, both of whom had stronger armies than his own</span>
				<span class='text'>In the [[Treaty of Nemours]], signed on 7 July 1585, he was forced to give in to all the League's demands, even that he pay its troops</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, ''Renaissance France'', 440</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He went into hiding to fast and pray, surrounded by a bodyguard known as &quot;[[The forty-five guards|the Forty-five]]&quot;, and left Catherine to sort out the mess</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Henry did not tell Catherine of his plan for a solution to his problems</span>
				<span class='text'>On 23 December 1588, he asked the Duke of Guise to call on him at the [[Château de Blois]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As Guise entered the king's chamber, the Forty-five plunged their blades into his body, and he died at the foot of the king's bed</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; She was inspired by the example of her father-in-law, [[Francis I of France|King Francis I of France]], who had hosted the leading artists of Europe at his court, and by her [[Medici]] ancestors</span>
				<span class='text'>In an age of civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display</span>
				<span class='text'>Once in control of the royal purse, she launched a programme of artistic patronage that lasted for three decades</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time, she presided over a distinctive late [[French Renaissance]] culture in all branches of the arts</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 220</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;An [[inventory]] drawn up at the [[Hôtel de la Reine]] after Catherine's death shows her to have been a keen collector</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 240–41</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; There were also hundreds of portraits, for which a vogue had developed during Catherine's lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'>Many portraits in her collection were by [[Jean Clouet]] (1480–1541) and his son [[François Clouet]] (c</span>
				<span class='text'>1510 – 1572)</span>
				<span class='text'>François Clouet drew and painted portraits of all Catherine's family and of many members of the court</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After Catherine's death, a decline in the quality of French portraiture set in</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1610, the school patronised by the late Valois court and brought to its pinnacle by François Clouet had all but died out</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Dimier, 308–19; Jollet, 17–18</span>

				<span class='text'>1594), few of whose works survive, and [[Antoine Caron]] (c</span>
				<span class='text'>1521 – 1599), who became Catherine's official painter after working at [[Fontainebleau]] under [[Francesco Primaticcio|Primaticcio]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Caron's vivid [[Mannerism]], with its love of ceremonial and its preoccupation with massacres, reflects the neurotic atmosphere of the French court during the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Blunt, 98, 100</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Many of Caron's paintings, such as those of the ''Triumphs of the Seasons'', are of [[allegory|allegorical]] subjects that echo the [[Catherine de' Medici's court festivals|festivities]] for which Catherine's court was famous</span>
				<span class='text'>His designs for the [[Valois Tapestries]] celebrate the ''fêtes'', picnics, and mock battles of the &quot;magnificent&quot; entertainments hosted by Catherine</span>
				<span class='text'>They depict events held at Fontainebleau in 1564; at [[Bayonne]] in 1565 for the summit meeting with the Spanish court; and at the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries]] in 1573 for the visit of the Polish ambassadors who presented the Polish crown to Catherine's son [[Henry III of France|Henry of Anjou]]</span>

				<span class='text'>They were usually dedicated to the ideal of peace in the realm and based on [[Mythology|mythological]] themes</span>
				<span class='text'>To create the necessary dramas, music, and scenic effects for these events, Catherine employed the leading artists and architects of the day</span>
				<span class='text'>Historian Frances Yates has called her &quot;a great creative artist in festivals&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Yates, 68</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Catherine gradually introduced changes to the traditional entertainments: for example, she increased the prominence of dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments</span>
				<span class='text'>A distinctive new art form, the ''[[ballets de cour|ballet de cour]]'', emerged from these creative advances</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Yates, 51; Strong, 102, 121–22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Owing to its synthesis of dance, music, verse, and setting, the production of the ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'' in 1581 is regarded by scholars as the first authentic ballet</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lee, 44</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Catherine de' Medici's great love among the arts was architecture</span>
				<span class='text'> &quot;As the daughter of the Medici&quot;, suggests French art historian Jean-Pierre Babelon, &quot;she was driven by a passion to build and a desire to leave great achievements behind her when she died</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Babelon, 263</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After Henry II's death, Catherine set out to immortalise her husband's memory and to  enhance the grandeur of the Valois monarchy through a series of costly building projects</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 79, 455; Sutherland, ''Ancien Régime'', 6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; These included work on châteaux at Montceaux-en-Brie, [[Saint-Maur-des-Fossés]], and Chenonceau</span>
				<span class='text'>Catherine built two new palaces in Paris: the Tuileries and the Hôtel de la Reine</span>
				<span class='text'>She was closely involved in the planning and supervising of all her architectural schemes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 228</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Catherine had emblems of her love and grief carved into the stonework of her buildings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 223</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Poets lauded her as the new Artemisia, after [[Artemisia II of Caria]], who built the [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum]] at [[Halicarnassus]] as a tomb for her dead husband</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 266; Hoogvliet, 108</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As the centrepiece of an ambitious new chapel, she commissioned a magnificent tomb for Henry at the basilica of Saint Denis</span>
				<span class='text'>It was designed by [[Francesco Primaticcio]] (1504–1570), with sculpture by Germain Pilon (1528–1590)</span>
				<span class='text'>Art historian Henri Zerner has called this monument &quot;the last and most brilliant of the royal tombs of the Renaissance&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = &quot;zccclxxvix&quot;&gt;Zerner, 379</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Catherine also commissioned [[Germain Pilon]] to carve the marble sculpture that contains Henry II's heart</span>
				<span class='text'>A poem by Ronsard, engraved on its base, tells the reader not to wonder that so small a vase can hold so large a heart, since Henry's real heart resides in Catherine's breast</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hoogvliet, 111</span>
				<span class='text'>Ronsard may be referring to Artemisia, who drank the ashes of her dead husband, which became part of her own body</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Although Catherine spent ruinous sums on the arts,&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 168</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; most of her patronage left no permanent legacy</span>

				<span class='text'> In fact, a large population of Italians — bankers, silk-weavers, philosophers, musicians, and artists, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]]— had emigrated to France to promote the burgeoning [[Renaissance]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, popular culture frequently attributes Italian culinary influence and forks in France to Catherine</span>
				<span class='text'>he earliest known reference to Catherine as the popularizer of Italian culinary innovation is the entry for “cuisine” in [[Diderot]] and [[d’Alembert]]’s ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' published in 1754, which describes [[haute cuisine]] as decadent and effeminate and explains that fussy sauces and fancy fricassees arrived in France via “that crowd of corrupt Italians who served at the court of Catherine de’ Medici</span>
