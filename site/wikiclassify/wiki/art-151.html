				<span class='text'>Although Haeckel's ideas are important to the history of [[evolutionary theory]], and although he was a competent [[invertebrate]] [[anatomist]] most famous for his work on [[radiolaria]], many speculative concepts that he championed are now considered incorrect</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Haeckel advanced a version of the earlier [[recapitulation theory]] previously set out by [[√âtienne Serres]] in the 1820s and supported by followers of [[√âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] including [[Robert Edmond Grant]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|1989|pp=53‚Äì53, 86‚Äì88, 337‚Äì340}}&lt;/ref&gt; It proposed a link between [[ontogeny]] (development of form) and [[phylogeny]] (evolutionary descent), summed up by Haeckel in the phrase &quot;ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>His concept of recapitulation has been refuted in the form he gave it (now called &quot;strong recapitulation&quot;), in favour of the ideas [[Karl Ernst von Baer#Baer's laws (embryology)|first advanced by Karl Ernst von Baer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The strong recapitulation hypothesis views ontogeny as repeating forms of the ancestors, while weak recapitulation means that what is repeated (and built upon) is the ancestral embryonic development process</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richardson and Keuck, (Biol</span>
				<span class='text'>Review (2002), 77, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>495‚Äì528) show that it is a simplification to suppose that Haeckel held the recapitulation theory in its strong form</span>
				<span class='text'>They quote Haeckel as saying &quot;If [recapitulation] was always complete, it would be a very easy task to construct whole phylogeny on the basis of ontogeny</span>
				<span class='text'> ‚Ä¶ There is certainly, even now, a number of lower vertebrate animals (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>some Anthozoa and Vermes) where we are authorised to interpret each embryological form directly as the historical representation or portrait-like silhouette of an extinct ancestral form</span>
				<span class='text'>But in a great majority of animals, including man, this is not possible because the infinitely varied conditions of existence have led the embryonic forms themselves to be changed and to partly lose their original condition (Haeckel, 1903: pp</span>
				<span class='text'>435‚Äì436)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Haeckel supported the theory with [[embryo drawings]] that have since been shown to be oversimplified and in part inaccurate, and the theory is now considered an oversimplification of quite complicated relationships</span>
				<span class='text'>Haeckel introduced the concept of [[heterochrony]], the change in timing of [[embryonic development]] over the course of evolution</span>
				<span class='text'>aeckel was a flamboyant figure, who sometimes took great, non-scientific leaps from available evidence</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, at the time when Darwin published ''[[On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection]]'' (1859), Haeckel postulated that evidence of human evolution would be found in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]])</span>
				<span class='text'> At that time, no remains of human ancestors had yet been found</span>
				<span class='text'> He described these theoretical remains in great detail and even named the as-yet unfound species, ''Pithecanthropus alalus'', and instructed his students such as [[Richard Hertwig|Richard]] and [[Oskar Hertwig]] to go and find it</span>
				<span class='text'>ne student did find some remains: a Dutchman named [[Eug√®ne Dubois]] searched the [[East Indies]] from 1887 to 1895, discovering the remains of [[Java Man]] in 1891, consisting of a skullcap, thighbone, and a few teeth</span>
				<span class='text'>These remains are among the oldest hominid remains ever found</span>
				<span class='text'>Dubois classified Java Man with Haeckel's ''[[Pithecanthropus]]'' label, though they were later reclassified as ''[[Homo erectus]]''</span>

				<span class='text'> ---&gt;The [[creationism|creationist]] [[polygenism]] of [[Samuel George Morton]] and [[Louis Agassiz]], which presented human [[race (classification of human beings)|races]] as separately created [[species]], was rejected by [[Charles Darwin]], who argued for the [[Monogenism|monogenesis]] of the [[human]] species and the [[recent African origin of modern humans|African origin of modern humans]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast to most of Darwin's supporters, Haeckel put forward a doctrine of evolutionary polygenism based on the ideas of the linguist [[August Schleicher]], in which several different language groups had arisen separately from speechless prehuman ''Urmenschen'', which themselves had evolved from simian ancestors</span>
				<span class='text'>These separate languages had completed the transition from animals to man, and, under the influence of each main branch of languages, humans had evolved ‚Äì in a kind of [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] use-inheritance ‚Äì as separate species, which could be subdivided into races</span>
				<span class='text'>From this Haeckel drew the implication that languages with the most potential formed human species with the most potential, led by the Semitic and Indo-Germanic groups, with Berber, Jewish, Greco-Roman and Germanic varieties to the fore</span>

				<span class='text'>Human language as such probably developed only after the species of speechless Urmenschen or Affenmenschen had split into several species or kinds</span>
				<span class='text'>With each of these human species, language developed on its own and independently of the others</span>
				<span class='text'>At least this is the view of Schleicher, one of the foremost authorities on this subject</span>
				<span class='text'>Ä¶ If one views the origin of the branches of language as the special and principal act of becoming human, and the species of humankind as distinguished according to their language stem, then one can say that the different species of men arose independently of one another</span>
				<span class='text'>aeckel's view can be seen as a forerunner of the views of [[Carleton S</span>
				<span class='text'>Coon|Carleton Coon]], who also believed that human races evolved independently and in parallel with each other</span>
				<span class='text'>These ideas eventually fell from favour</span>
				<span class='text'>aeckel also applied the hypothesis of polygenism to the modern diversity of human groups</span>
				<span class='text'>He became a key figure in [[social darwinism]] and leading proponent of [[scientific racism]], stating for instance:&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Creation'', 6th edition (1914), volume 2, page 429</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;:The Caucasian, or Mediterranean man (''Homo Mediterraneus''), has from time immemorial been placed at the head of all the races of men, as the most highly developed and perfect</span>
				<span class='text'>It is generally called the Caucasian race, but as, among all the varieties of the species, the Caucasian branch is the least important, we prefer the much more suitable appellation proposed by [[Friedrich M√ºller (linguist)|Friedrich M√ºller]], namely, that of ''Mediterranese''</span>
				<span class='text'>For the most important varieties of this species, which are moreover the most eminent actors in what is called &quot;Universal History,&quot; first rose to a flourishing condition on the shores of the Mediterranean</span>
				<span class='text'>Ä¶ This species alone (with the exception of the Mongolian) has had an actual history; it alone has attained to that degree of civilisation which seems to raise men above the rest of nature</span>
				<span class='text'>aeckel divided human beings into ten races, of which the [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] was the highest and the primitives were doomed to extinction</span>

				<span class='text'>Developmental series were used to show stages within a species, but inconsistent views and stages made it even more difficult to compare different species</span>
				<span class='text'>It was agreed by all European evolutionists that all [[vertebrate]]s looked very similar at an early stage, in what was thought of as a common ideal type, but there was a continuing debate from the 1820s between the Romantic [[recapitulation theory]] that human embryos developed through stages of the forms of all the major groups of adult animals, literally manifesting a sequence of organisms on a [[great chain of being|linear chain of being]], and [[Karl Ernst von Baer]]'s opposing view that the early general forms diverged into four major groups of specialised forms without ever resembling the adult of another species, showing affinity to an [[archetype]] but no relation to other types or any [[transmutation of species]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By the time Haeckel was teaching he was able to use a textbook with woodcut illustrations written by his own teacher [[Albert von K√∂lliker]], which purported to explain human development while also using other mammalian embryos to claim a coherent sequence</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the significance to ideas of transformism, this was not really polite enough for the new popular science writing, and was a matter for medical institutions and for experts who could make their own comparisons</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; It mentioned von Baer's 1828 anecdote (misattributing it to [[Louis Agassiz]]) that at an early stage embryos were so similar that it could be impossible to tell whether an unlabelled specimen was of a mammal, a bird, or of a reptile, and Darwin's own research using embryonic stages of [[barnacle]]s to show that they are [[crustacean]]s, while cautioning against the idea that one organism or embryonic stage is &quot;higher&quot; or &quot;lower&quot;, or more or less evolved</span>

				<span class='text'>He used [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] to reconstruct the [[evolutionary history of life]], in the absence of fossil evidence using embryology as evidence of ancestral relationships</span>
				<span class='text'>He invented new terms, including [[ontogeny]] and [[phylogeny]], to present his evolutionised recapitulation theory that &quot;ontogeny recapitulated phylogeny&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The two massive volumes sold poorly, and were heavy going: with his limited understanding of German, Darwin found them impossible to read</span>
				<span class='text'>Haeckel's publisher turned down a proposal for a &quot;''strictly scholarly'' and ''objective''&quot; second edition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=hopwood2006 /&gt;{{rp|269‚Äì270}}=== Embryological drawings ===[[File:Tree of life by Haeckel</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|right|thumb|220px|Tree of Life by Haeckel]]Haeckel's aim was a reformed morphology with evolution as the organising principle of a cosmic synthesis unifying science, religion, and art</span>
				<span class='text'>He was giving successful &quot;popular lectures&quot; on his ideas to students and townspeople in [[Jena]], in an approach pioneered by his teacher [[Rudolf Virchow]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To meet his publisher's need for a popular work he used a student's transcript of his lectures as the basis of his ''Nat√ºrliche Sch√∂pfungsgeschichte'' of 1868, presenting a comprehensive presentation of evolution</span>
				<span class='text'>In the Spring of that year he drew figures for the book, synthesising his views of specimens in Jena and published pictures to represent types</span>
				<span class='text'>After publication he told a colleague that the images &quot;are completely exact, partly copied from nature, partly assembled from all illustrations of these early stages that have hitherto become known</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; There were various styles of [[embryological drawings]] at that time, ranging from more schematic representations to &quot;naturalistic&quot; illustrations of specific specimens</span>
				<span class='text'>Haeckel believed privately that his figures were both exact and synthetic, and in public asserted that they were schematic like most figures used in teaching</span>
				<span class='text'>The images were reworked to match in size and orientation, and though displaying Haeckel's own views of essential features, they support von Baer's concept that vertebrate embryos begin similarly and then diverge</span>
				<span class='text'>Relating different images on a grid conveyed a powerful evolutionary message</span>
				<span class='text'>As a book for the general public, it followed the common practice of not citing sources</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=hopwood2006 /&gt;{{rp|270‚Äì274}}[[File:Embryo - copies</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|In 1868 Haeckel illustrated von Baer's observation that early embryos of different species could not be told apart by using the same woodcut three times as dog, chick and turtle embryos: he changed this in the next edition</span>
				<span class='text'>]The book sold very well, and while some anatomical experts hostile to Haeckel's evolutionary views expressed some private concerns that certain figures had been drawn rather freely, the figures showed what they already knew about similarities in embryos</span>
				<span class='text'>The first published concerns came from [[Ludwig R√ºtimeyer]], a professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the [[University of Basel]] who had placed fossil mammals in an evolutionary lineage early in the 1860s and had been sent a complimentary copy</span>
				<span class='text'>At the end of 1868 his review in the ''Archiv f√ºr Anthropologie'' wondered about the claim that the work was &quot;popular and scholarly&quot;, doubting whether the second was true, and expressed horror about such public discussion of man's place in nature with illustrations such as the evolutionary trees being shown to non-experts</span>
				<span class='text'>Though he made no suggestion that embryo illustrations should be directly based on specimens, to him the subject demanded the utmost &quot;scrupulosity and conscientiousness&quot; and an artist must &quot;not arbitrarily model or generalise his originals for speculative purposes&quot; which he considered proved by comparison with works by other authors</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, &quot;one and the same, moreover incorrectly interpreted woodcut, is presented to the reader three times in a row and with three different captions as [the] embryo of the dog, the chick, [and] the turtle</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He accused Haeckel of &quot;playing fast and loose with the public and with science&quot;, and failing to live up to the obligation to the truth of every serious researcher</span>
				<span class='text'>Haeckel responded with angry accusations of bowing to religious prejudice, but in the second (1870) edition changed the duplicated embryo images to a single image captioned &quot;embryo of a mammal or bird&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Duplication using galvanoplastic stereotypes ([[Stereotype (printing)|clich√©s]]) was a common technique in textbooks, but not on the same page to represent different eggs or embryos</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1891 Haeckel made the excuse that this &quot;extremely rash foolishness&quot; had occurred in undue haste but was &quot;bona Ô¨Åde&quot;, and since repetition of incidental details was obvious on close inspection, it is unlikely to have been intentional deception</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=hopwood2006 /&gt;{{rp|275‚Äì276;282‚Äì286}}The revised 1870 second edition of 1,500 copies attracted more attention, being quickly followed by further revised editions with larger print runs as the book became a prominent part of the optimistic, nationalist, anticlerical &quot;culture of progress&quot; in [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s new [[German Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The similarity of early vertebrate embryos became common knowledge, and the illustrations were praised by experts such as [[Michael Foster (physiologist)|Michael Foster]] of the [[University of Cambridge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the introduction to his 1871 ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'', Darwin gave particular praise to Haeckel, writing that if ''Nat√ºrliche Sch√∂pfungsgeschichte'' &quot;had appeared before my essay had been written, I should probably never have completed it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The first chapter included an illustration: &quot;As some of my readers may never have seen a drawing of an embryo, I have given one of man and another of a dog, at about the same early stage of development, carefully copied from two works of undoubted accuracy&quot; with a footnote citing the sources and noting that &quot;H√§ckel has also given analogous drawings in his ''Sch√∂pfungsgeschichte</span>
				<span class='text'>'&quot; The fifth edition of Haeckel's book appeared in 1874, with its frontispiece a heroic portrait of Haeckel himself, replacing the previous controversial image of the heads of apes and humans</span>

				<span class='text'>Haeckel took particular care over the illustrations, changing to the leading zoological publisher Wilhelm Engelmann of Leipzig and obtaining from them use of illustrations from their other textbooks as well as preparing his own drawings including a dramatic double page illustration showing &quot;early&quot;, &quot;somewhat later&quot; and &quot;still later&quot; stages of 8 different vertebrates</span>
