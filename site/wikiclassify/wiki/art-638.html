				<span class='text'>{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=157}}As a member of the board and the executive committee, Kohl pushed towards a party reform, supporting liberal stances in education and social policies, including employee participation</span>
				<span class='text'>However, when a proposal by the board was put to vote at a party convention in early 1971 in [[D√ºsseldorf]], Kohl was unable to prevail against protest coming from the conservative wing of the party around [[Alfred Dregger]] and the sister party [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]], costing him support at the liberal wing of the party</span>
				<span class='text'>To make matters worse, in a mistake during the voting process, Kohl himself voted against the proposal, further angering his supporters, such as party treasurer [[Walther Leisler Kiep]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Schwarz|2012|pages=158-159}}Nevertheless, when Kiesinger stepped down as party chairman in 1971, Kohl was a candidate for his succession</span>

				<span class='text'>After Barzel announced in 10 May 1973 that he would not run for the post of party chairman again, Kohl succeeded him at a party convention in [[Saarbr√ºcken]] on 12 June 1973, amassing 520 of 600 votes, with him as the only candidate</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Schwarz|2012|pages=164-165}} He would hold the position until 1998</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Schwarz|2012|p=166}}===The 1976 Bundestag election===In the [[German federal election, 1976|1976 federal election]], Kohl was the CDU/CSU's candidate for chancellor</span>
				<span class='text'>The CDU/CSU coalition performed very well, winning 48</span>
				<span class='text'>% of the vote</span>
				<span class='text'>However they were kept out of government by the centre-left cabinet formed by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] and [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)]], led by Social Democrat [[Helmut Schmidt]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Kohl then retired as minister-president of Rhineland-Palatinate to become the leader of the CDU/CSU in the [[Bundestag]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was succeeded by Bernhard Vogel</span>
				<span class='text'>==Leader of the opposition===In the [[German federal election, 1980|1980 federal elections]], Kohl had to play second fiddle, when CSU-leader [[Franz Josef Strau√ü]] became the CDU/CSU's candidate for chancellor</span>
				<span class='text'>Strau√ü was also unable to defeat the SPD/FDP alliance</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike Kohl, Strau√ü did not want to continue as the leader of the CDU/CSU and remained Minister-President of [[Bavaria]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Kohl remained as leader of the opposition, under the third Schmidt cabinet (1980‚Äì82)</span>
				<span class='text'>On 17 September 1982, a conflict of economic policy occurred between the governing SPD/FDP coalition partners</span>
				<span class='text'>The FDP wanted to radically liberalise the labour market, while the SPD preferred greater job security</span>
				<span class='text'>The FDP began talks with the CDU/CSU to form a new government</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}==Chancellor of West Germany=====Rise to power===On 1 October 1982, the CDU proposed a [[constructive vote of no confidence]] which was supported by the FDP</span>
				<span class='text'>The motion carried</span>
				<span class='text'>Three days later, the Bundestag voted in a [[Cabinet Kohl I|new CDU/CSU-FDP coalition cabinet]], with Kohl as chancellor</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of the important details of the new coalition had been hammered out on 20 September, though minor details were reportedly still being hammered out as the vote took place</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Kohl's election was done according to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], it came amid some controversy</span>
				<span class='text'> The FDP had fought its 1980 campaign on the side of the SPD and even placed Chancellor Schmidt on some of their campaign posters</span>
				<span class='text'>There were also doubts that the new government had the support of a majority of the people</span>
				<span class='text'>In answer, the new government aimed at new elections at the earliest possible date</span>
				<span class='text'> Polls suggested that a clear majority was indeed in reach</span>
				<span class='text'> As the Basic Law only allows the dissolution of parliament after an unsuccessful confidence motion, Kohl had to take another controversial move: he called for a confidence vote only a month after being sworn in, in which members of his coalition abstained</span>
				<span class='text'>[[President of Germany|President]] [[Karl Carstens]] then dissolved the Bundestag and called new elections</span>
				<span class='text'>he move was controversial, as the coalition parties denied their votes to the same man they had elected Chancellor a month before and whom they wanted to re-elect after the parliamentary election</span>
				<span class='text'>However, this step was condoned by the German [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] as a legal instrument and was again applied (by SPD Chancellor [[Gerhard Schr√∂der]] and his [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Green]] allies) in 2005</span>

				<span class='text'>Some opposition members of the Bundestag asked the Federal Constitutional Court to declare the whole proceeding unconstitutional</span>
				<span class='text'>It denied their claim, but did set restrictions on a similar move in the future</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Cabinet Kohl II|second Kohl cabinet]] pushed through several controversial plans, including the stationing of [[NATO]] midrange missiles, against major opposition from the peace movement</span>
				<span class='text'>On 24 January 1984, Kohl spoke before the [[Israel]]i [[Knesset]], as the first Chancellor of the post-war generation</span>
				<span class='text'>In his speech, he used liberal journalist G√ºnter Gaus' famous sentence that he had &quot;the mercy of a late birth&quot; (&quot;Gnade der sp√§ten Geburt&quot;)</span>

				<span class='text'>The photograph, which depicted their minutes long handshake became an important symbol of French-German reconciliation</span>
				<span class='text'>Kohl and Mitterrand developed a close political relationship, forming an important motor for [[European integration]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Together, they laid the foundations for European projects, like [[Eurocorps]] and [[Arte]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This French-German cooperation also was vital for important European projects, like the [[Treaty of Maastricht]] and the Euro</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1985, Kohl and US President [[Ronald Reagan]], as part of a plan to observe the 40th anniversary of [[V-E Day]], saw an opportunity to demonstrate the strength of the friendship that existed between Germany and its former foe</span>
				<span class='text'>During a November 1984 visit to the White House, Kohl appealed to Reagan to join him in symbolizing the reconciliation of their two countries at a German military cemetery</span>
				<span class='text'>As Reagan visited Germany as part of the [[G8|G6]] conference in [[Bonn]], the pair visited [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] [[concentration camp]] on 5 May, and more controversially, the German military cemetery at [[Bitburg]], discovered to hold 49 members of the [[Waffen-SS]]</span>

				<span class='text'>]Following the breach of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the collapse of the East German Communist regime in 1989, Kohl's handling of the East German issue would become the turning point of his chancellorship</span>
				<span class='text'>Kohl, like most West Germans, was initially caught unaware when the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] was toppled in late 1989</span>
				<span class='text'>However, well aware of his constitutional mandate to seek German unity, he immediately moved to make it a reality</span>
				<span class='text'>Taking advantage of the historic political changes occurring in East Germany, Kohl presented a ten-point plan for &quot;Overcoming of the division of Germany and Europe&quot; without consulting his coalition partner, the FDP, or the Western Allies</span>
				<span class='text'>In February 1990, he visited the Soviet Union seeking a guarantee from [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] that the USSR would allow German reunification to proceed</span>
				<span class='text'>One month later, the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] ‚Äî the renamed SED ‚Äî was roundly defeated by a grand coalition headed by the East German counterpart of Kohl's CDU, which ran on a platform of speedy reunification</span>

				<span class='text'>This treaty stipulated that when reunification took place, it would be under the quicker provisions of Article 23 of the Basic Law</span>
				<span class='text'> That article stated that any new states could adhere to the Basic Law by a simple majority vote</span>
				<span class='text'> The alternative would have been the more protracted route of drafting a completely new constitution for the newly reunified country, as provided by Article 146 of the Basic Law</span>
				<span class='text'> However, an Article 146 reunification would have opened up contentious issues in West Germany, and would have been impractical in any case since by then East Germany was in a state of utter collapse</span>
				<span class='text'> In contrast, an Article 23 reunification could be completed in as little as six months</span>
				<span class='text'>ver the objections of [[Deutsche Bundesbank|Bundesbank]] president [[Karl Otto P√∂hl]], he allowed a 1:1 exchange rate for wages, interest and rent between the [[German mark|West]] and [[East German mark|East Marks]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the end, this policy would seriously hurt companies in the [[new federal states]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Together with Foreign Minister [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]], Kohl was able to resolve talks with the former Allies of World War II to allow [[German reunification]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He received assurances from Gorbachev that a reunified Germany would be able to choose which international alliance it wanted to join, although Kohl made no secret that he wanted the reunified Germany to inherit West Germany's seats at NATO and the EC</span>
				<span class='text'> reunification treaty was signed on 31 August 1990, and was overwhelmingly approved by both parliaments on 20 September 1990</span>
				<span class='text'>On 3 October 1990, East Germany officially ceased to exist, and its territory joined the Federal Republic as the five states of [[Brandenburg]], Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, [[Saxony]], Saxony-Anhalt and [[Thuringia]]</span>
				<span class='text'> These states had been the original five states of East Germany before being abolished in 1952, and had been reconstituted in August</span>
				<span class='text'> East and West Berlin were reunited as the capital of the enlarged Federal Republic</span>
				<span class='text'>After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Kohl confirmed that [[Historical Eastern Germany|historically German territories]] east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] were definitively part of [[Poland]], thereby relinquishing any claim Germany had to them</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1993, Kohl confirmed, via treaty with the Czech Republic, that Germany would no longer bring forward territorial claims as to the pre-1945 [[ethnic German]] so-called [[Sudetenland]]</span>
