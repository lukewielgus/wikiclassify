				<span class='text'>In the Madrigals of War Monteverdi has organized poetry that describes the pursuits of love through the allegory of war the hunt for love and the battle to find love</span>
				<span class='text'>In the second half of the book the Madrigals of Love Monteverdi organized poetry that describes the unhappiness of being in love unfaithfulness and ungrateful lovers who feel no shame</span>
				<span class='text'>In his previous madrigal collections Monteverdi usually set poetry from one or two poets he was in contact with through the court where he was employed</span>
				<span class='text'>The Madrigals of War and Love represent an overview of the poets he has dealt with throughout his life the classical poetry of  poetry by his contemporaries      and  or anonymous poets who Monteverdi found and adapted to his needs</span>

				<span class='text'> Hor cheâ€™l ciel e la terra eâ€™l vento tace Now that the sky earth and wind are silent Sonnet by ## is the first significant poetic work of the collection in which Monteverdi splits into two sections</span>
				<span class='text'>In the first section his poetry introduces the idea of the wars of love in which he yearns for someone to love him</span>
				<span class='text'>## War is my condition full of anger and grief and only when thinking of her do I find some peace</span>
				<span class='text'>## In the second section Thus from a single bright and living fountain Cosi sol dâ€™una chiara fonte viva the symbolism of war continues#### One hand alone cures me and wounds me</span>

				<span class='text'> and includes the dramatic scene in which the orchestra and voices form two separate entities acting as counterparts</span>
				<span class='text'>Most likely Monteverdi was inspired to try this arrangement because of the two opposite balconies in San Marco</span>
				<span class='text'>What made this composition also stand out is that it is the first time Monteverdi used string  fast repetition of the same tone and  plucking strings with fingers for special effect in dramatic scenes</span>
