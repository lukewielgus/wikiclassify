				<span class='text'>The focus of the game prior to Gretzky's arrival, he said, especially among the Canadian teams, was on the player with the puck—in getting the puck to a star player who would make the big play</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Gretzky reversed that</span>
				<span class='text'>He knew he wasn't big enough, strong enough, or even fast enough to do what he wanted to do if others focused on him</span>
				<span class='text'>Like a magician, he had to direct attention elsewhere, to his four teammates on the ice with him, to create the momentary distraction in order to move unnoticed into the open ice where size and strength didn't matter</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Gretzky made his opponents compete with five players, not one, and he made his teammates full partners to the game</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;In the past, defenders and teams had learned to devise strategies to stop opponents with the puck</span>
				<span class='text'>Without the puck, that was interference</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;The Soviets and Gretzky changed the NHL game,&quot; says Dryden</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Gretzky, the kid from Brantford with the Belarusian name, was the acceptable face of Soviet hockey</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;I get a feeling about where a teammate is going to be,&quot; he said</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;A lot of times, I can turn and pass without even looking</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Young&quot;/&gt;Veteran Canadian journalist [[Peter Gzowski]] says that Gretzky seemed to be able to, in effect, slow down time</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfn|Gzowski|2004|pp=203–204}} &quot;There is an unhurried grace to everything Gretzky does on the ice</span>
				<span class='text'>Winding up for the slapshot, he will stop for an almost imperceptible moment at the top of his arc, like a golfer with a rhythmic swing</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; &quot;Gretzky uses this room to insert an extra beat into his actions</span>
				<span class='text'>In front of the net, eyeball to eyeball with the goaltender … he will … hold the puck one … extra instant, upsetting the anticipated rhythm of the game, extending the moment</span>
				<span class='text'>… He distorts time, and not only by slowing it down</span>
				<span class='text'>Sometimes he will release the puck before he appears to be ready, threading the pass through a maze of players precisely to the blade of a teammate's stick, or finding a chink in a goaltender's armour and slipping the puck into it … before the goaltender is ready to react</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Gzowski|2004|pp=174–175}}===Major coaching influences===However, Gretzky denied that he had any exotic innate abilities</span>
				<span class='text'>He said that many of his advantages were a result of his father's brilliant coaching</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;blockquote&gt;Some say I have a '[[Extrasensory perception|sixth sense]]' … Baloney</span>
				<span class='text'>I've just learned to guess what's going to happen next</span>
				<span class='text'>It's anticipation</span>
				<span class='text'>It's not God-given, it's Wally-given</span>
				<span class='text'>He used to stand on the blue line and say to me, 'Watch, this is how everybody else does it</span>
				<span class='text'> Then he'd shoot a puck along the boards and into the corner and then go chasing after it</span>
				<span class='text'>Then he'd come back and say, 'Now, this is how the smart player does it</span>
				<span class='text'> He'd shoot it into the corner again, only this time he cut across to the other side and picked it up over there</span>
				<span class='text'>Who says anticipation can't be taught?{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=87}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Gretzky learned much about hockey from his father on a backyard rink at his home</span>
				<span class='text'>Walter Gretzky had been an outstanding Junior B hockey player</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|MacGregor|1999|p=20}} He cultivated a love of hockey in his sons and provided them with a backyard rink and drills to enhance their skills</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|MacGregor|1999|p=19}} &lt;!-- Asked about Wayne's development, Walter and replied, &quot;Wayne always did like hockey</span>
				<span class='text'>Even when he was three years old—and it just kind of happened</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|MacGregor|1999|p=18}} Wayne was asked about how it happened</span>
				<span class='text'>Where it happened was &quot;right in my own backyard</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|MacGregor|1999|p=19}} --&gt; On the backyard rink, nicknamed the &quot;Wally Coliseum&quot;, winter was total hockey immersion with Walter as mentor-teacher as well as teammate</span>
				<span class='text'>Walter's drills were his own invention, but were ahead of their time in Canada</span>
				<span class='text'>Gretzky would later remark that the Soviet National Team's practice drills, which impressed Canada in 1972, had nothing to offer him: &quot;I'd been doing these drills since I was three</span>
				<span class='text'>My Dad was very smart</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Gretzky|Davidson|1999|p=2}}In his autobiography, Gretzky describes how at practices his dad would drill him on the fundamentals of smart hockey:&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Him: &quot;Where's the last place a guy looks before he passes it?&quot;Me: &quot;The guy he's passing to</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Him: &quot;Which means</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Me: &quot;Get over there and intercept it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Him: &quot;Where do you skate?&quot;Me: &quot;To where the puck is going, not where it's been</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Him: &quot;If you get cut off, what are you gonna do?&quot;Me: &quot;Peel</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Him: &quot;Which way?&quot;Me: &quot;Away from the guy, not towards him</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=88}}&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Wayne also salutes his coach at the Edmonton Oilers, Glen (&quot;Slats&quot;) Sather, as an important influence in his development as a hockey player</span>
				<span class='text'>Gretzky played for 10 years with the Oilers, with Sather as coach</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;It's as if my father raised me until age 17, then turned me over to Slats and said, 'You take him from here</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wayne Gretzky 1997 6&quot;/&gt;===Early start===Where Gretzky differed from others in his development was in the extraordinary commitment of time on the ice</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;From the age of three to the age of 12, I could easily be out there for eight to 10 hours a day,&quot; Gretzky has said</span>

				<span class='text'>I'd get up in the morning, skate from 7:00 to 8:30, go to school, come home at 3:30, stay on the ice until my mom insisted I come in for dinner, eat in my skates, then go back out until 9:00</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfn|Redmond|1993|pp=12–13}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; When asked how he managed, at age ten, to score 378 goals in a single season, Gretzky explained,&lt;blockquote&gt;See, kids usually don't start playing hockey until they're six or seven</span>
				<span class='text'>Ice isn't grass</span>
				<span class='text'>It's a whole new surface and everybody starts from ground zero</span>
				<span class='text'>… By the time I was ten, I had eight years on skates instead of four, and a few seasons' worth of ice time against ten-year-olds</span>
				<span class='text'>So I had a long head start on everyone else</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Gretzky|Reilly|1990|p=19}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;===Study of game===Much has been written about Gretzky's highly developed hockey instincts, but he once explained that what appeared to be instinct was, in large part, the effect of his relentless study and practice of the game, in cooperation with his coaches</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, he developed a deep understanding of its shifting patterns and dynamics</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter Gzowski says that the best of the best athletes in all sports understand the game so well, and in such detail, that they can instantly recognize and capitalize upon emerging patterns of play</span>
				<span class='text'>Analyzing Gretzky's hockey skills, he says, &quot;What we take to be creative genius is in fact a reaction to a situation that he has stored in his brain as deeply and firmly as his own phone number</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Gzowski presented this theory to Gretzky, and he fully agreed</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Gretzky said</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;That's a hundred percent right</span>
				<span class='text'>It's all practice</span>
				<span class='text'>I got it from my Dad</span>
				<span class='text'>Nine out of ten people think it's instinct, and it isn't</span>
				<span class='text'>Nobody would ever say a doctor had learned his profession by instinct; yet in my own way I've put in almost as much time studying hockey as a medical student puts in studying medicine</span>
