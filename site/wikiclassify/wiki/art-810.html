				<span class='text'> He is probably best-known today for his invention of the [[Dewar flask]], which he used in conjunction with extensive research into the liquefaction of gases</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also particularly interested in atomic and molecular [[spectroscopy]], working in these fields for more than 25 years</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life==James Dewar was born in [[Kincardine-on-Forth]] in 1842, the youngest of six boys</span>
				<span class='text'> He lost his parents at the age of 15</span>
				<span class='text'> He was educated at [[Dollar Academy]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he studied under [[Lyon Playfair, 1st Baron Playfair|Lord Playfair]], and later became Lord Playfair's assistant</span>
				<span class='text'>Dewar also studied under [[Friedrich August Kekul√© von Stradonitz|August Kekul√©]] at [[Ghent University|Ghent]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Career==In 1875, Dewar was elected Jacksonian professor of natural experimental philosophy at the [[University of Cambridge]], becoming a fellow of [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=DWR875J|name=Dewar, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a member of the [[Royal Institution]] and later, replaced Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>[[John Hall Gladstone]] in the role of Fullerian Professor of Chemistry in 1877</span>
				<span class='text'>Dewar was also the President of the [[Chemical Society]] in 1897 and the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1902, as well as serving on the [[Royal Commission]] established to examine London's water supply from 1893 to 1894 and the Committee on Explosives</span>
				<span class='text'>Whilst he was serving on the Committee on Explosives, [[Sir Frederick Augustus Abel|Frederick Augustus Abel]] and he developed [[cordite]], a smokeless gunpowder alternative</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1867 Dewar described several chemical formulas for [[benzene]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the Royal Society'', 1867, vol</span>
				<span class='text'>6, p</span>
				<span class='text'>82&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, one of the formulae, which does not represent benzene correctly and was not advocated by Dewar, is sometimes still called [[Dewar benzene]]</span>

				<span class='text'>55, p</span>
				<span class='text'>645&lt;/ref&gt;His scientific work covers a wide field ‚Äì his earlier papers cover a wide range of topics: [[organic chemistry]], [[hydrogen]] and its physical constants, high-temperature research, the temperature of the sun and of the [[electric spark]], electrophotometry, and the chemistry of the [[electric arc]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ith Professor [[John Gray McKendrick|J</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>McKendrick]], of Glasgow, he investigated the [[physiological]] action of light, and examined the changes which take place in the electrical condition of the [[retina]] under its influence</span>
				<span class='text'>With Professor [[George Downing Liveing|G</span>
				<span class='text'>D</span>
				<span class='text'>Liveing]], one of his colleagues at Cambridge, he began in 1878 a long series of [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] observations, the later of which were devoted to the spectroscopic examination of various gaseous elements separated from atmospheric air by the aid of low temperatures;  he was joined by Professor [[John Ambrose Fleming|J</span>
				<span class='text'>A</span>
				<span class='text'>Fleming]], of [[University College London]], in the investigation of the electrical behaviour of substances cooled to very low temperatures</span>
				<span class='text'>[Image:Dewar James flask</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|150px|Sir James Dewar at work]]His name is most widely known in connection with his work on the [[liquefaction]] of the so-called permanent gases and his researches at temperatures approaching [[absolute zero]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His interest in this branch of physics and chemistry dates back at least as far as 1874, when he discussed the &quot;Latent Heat of Liquid Gases&quot; before the British Association</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1878, he devoted a Friday evening lecture at the [[Royal Institution]] to the then-recent work of [[Louis Paul Cailletet]] and [[Raoul Pictet]], and exhibited for the first time in Great Britain the working of the Cailletet apparatus</span>
				<span class='text'>Six years later, again at the Royal Institution, he described the researches of [[Zygmunt Florenty Wr√≥blewski]] and [[Karol Olszewski]], and illustrated for the first time in public the [[Liquefaction of gases|liquefaction]] of [[oxygen]] and air</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon afterwards, he built a machine from which the liquefied gas could be drawn off through a valve for use as a cooling agent, before using the liquid oxygen in research work related to meteorites; about the same time, he also obtained oxygen in the solid state</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Ri 2014 - Thermos flask - James Dewar (27)</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|James Dewar's vacuum flask in the museum of the [[Royal Institution]]]]By 1891, he had designed and built, at the Royal Institution, machinery which yielded liquid oxygen in industrial quantities, and towards the end of that year, he showed that both liquid oxygen and liquid ozone are strongly attracted by a magnet</span>
				<span class='text'>About 1892, the idea occurred to him of using vacuum-jacketed vessels for the storage of liquid gases ‚Äì the Dewar flask (otherwise known as a Thermos or [[vacuum flask]]) ‚Äì the invention for which he became most famous</span>
				<span class='text'>The vacuum flask was so efficient at keeping heat out, it was found possible to preserve the liquids for comparatively long periods, making examination of their optical properties possible</span>
				<span class='text'>Dewar did not profit from the widespread adoption of his vacuum flask ‚Äì he lost a court case against [[Thermos L</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Thermos]] concerning the patent for his invention</span>
				<span class='text'>While Dewar was recognised as the inventor, because he did not patent his invention, no way to stop Thermos from using the design was possible</span>

				<span class='text'>tml |title=Dewar, James |accessdate=22 May 2008 |last=James |first=Frank |work=Chemistry Explained |publisher=Advameg Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt;He next experimented with a high-pressure hydrogen jet by which low temperatures were realised through the [[Joule‚ÄìThomson effect]], and the successful results he obtained led him to build at the Royal Institution a large [[regenerative cooling]] refrigerating machine</span>
				<span class='text'>Using this machine in 1898, [[liquid hydrogen]] was collected for the first time, solid [[hydrogen]] following in 1899</span>
				<span class='text'>He tried to liquefy the last remaining gas, [[helium]], which condenses into a liquid at ‚àí268</span>
				<span class='text'>&amp;nbsp;¬∞C, but owing to a number of factors, including a lack of helium with which to work, Dewar was preceded by [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] as the first person to produce [[liquid helium]], in 1908</span>
				<span class='text'>Onnes would later be awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his research into the properties of matter at low temperatures ‚Äì Dewar was nominated several times, but never successful in winning the Nobel Prize</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name='nobelref1' /&gt;In 1905, he began to investigate the gas-absorbing powers of [[charcoal]] when cooled to low temperatures, and applied his research to the production of high vacuums, which were useful for further experiments in atomic physics</span>
				<span class='text'>Dewar continued his research work into the properties of elements at low temperatures, specifically low-temperature [[calorimetry]], until the outbreak of [[World War I]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Royal Institution laboratories lost a number of staff to the war effort, both in fighting and scientific roles, and after the war, Dewar had little interest in restarting the serious research work which went on before the war</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortages of scholars necessarily compounded the problems</span>
				<span class='text'>His research during and after the war mainly involved investigating [[surface tension]] in soap bubbles, rather than further work into the properties of matter at low temperatures</span>
				<span class='text'>=Royal Institution Christmas Lectures==Dewar was invited to deliver several [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]]:&lt;br&gt;:''A Soap Bubble'' (1878):''Atoms'' (1880):''Alchemy in Relation to Modern Science'' (1883):''The Story of a Meteorite'' (1885):''The Chemistry of Light and Photography'' (1886):''Clouds and Cloudland'' (1888):''Frost and Fire'' (1890):''Air: Gaseous and Liquid'' (1893):''Christmas Lecture Epilogues'' (1912)==Honours and awards==Whilst Dewar was never recognised by the [[Swedish Academy]], he was recognised by many other institutions both before and after his death, in Britain and overseas</span>
				<span class='text'>[[The Royal Society]] elected him a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in June 1877 and bestowed their [[Rumford Medal|Rumford]] (1894), [[Davy Medal|Davy]] (1909), and [[Copley Medal]] (1916) medals upon him for his work, as well as inviting him to deliver their [[Bakerian Lecture]] in 1901</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1904, he was the first British subject to receive the [[Lavoisier Medal]] of the French Academy of Sciences, and in 1906, he was the first to be awarded the [[Matteucci Medal]] of the Italian Society of Sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>He was knighted in 1904 and awarded the Gunning Victoria Jubilee Prize for 1900‚Äì1904 by the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], and in 1908, he was awarded the [[Albert Medal (Royal Society of Arts)|Albert Medal]] of [[Royal Society of Arts|The Society of Arts]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A [[Dewar (crater)|lunar crater]] was named in his honour</span>
				<span class='text'>ames Dewar died in London in 1923, still holding the office of Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution, having refused to retire</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name='nobelref1'/&gt; He was cremated at the [[Golders Green Crematorium]], where his ashes remain</span>
