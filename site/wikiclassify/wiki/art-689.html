				<span class='text'>He died on his 37th birthday; according to different sources, his birth and death both occurred on [[Good Friday]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The matter has been much discussed, as both cannot be true</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; known as '''Raphael''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|f|eɪ|əl}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|r|æ|f|i|əl|,_|ˌ|r|A:|f|aɪ|ˈ|ɛ|l}}), was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[painter]] and [[architect]] of the [[High Renaissance]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His work is admired for its clarity of form, ease of composition, and visual achievement of the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] ideal of human grandeur</span>
				<span class='text'>Together with [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]], he forms the traditional trinity of great masters of that period</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See, for example {{cite book |first1=Hugh |last1=Honour |first2=John |last2=Fleming |title=A World History of Art |year=1982 |publisher=Macmillan Reference Books |location=London |isbn=9780333235836 |oclc=8828368 |page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;Raphael was enormously productive, running an unusually large workshop and, despite his death at 37, leaving a large body of work</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of his works are found in the [[Vatican Palace]], where the frescoed [[Raphael Rooms]] were the central, and the largest, work of his career</span>
				<span class='text'>The best known work is ''[[The School of Athens]]'' in the Vatican [[Stanza della Segnatura]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After his early years in Rome much of his work was executed by his workshop from his drawings, with considerable loss of quality</span>
				<span class='text'>He was extremely influential in his lifetime, though outside Rome his work was mostly known from his collaborative [[printmaking]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After his death, the influence of his great rival Michelangelo was more widespread until the 18th and 19th centuries, when Raphael's more serene and harmonious qualities were again regarded as the highest models</span>
				<span class='text'>His career falls naturally into three phases and three styles, first described by [[Giorgio Vasari]]: his early years in [[Umbria]], then a period of about four years (1504–1508) absorbing the artistic traditions of [[Florence]], followed by his last hectic and triumphant twelve years in Rome, working for two Popes and their close associates</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|[[Giovanni Santi]], Raphael's father; ''Christ supported by two angels'', c</span>
				<span class='text'>490]]Raphael was born in the small but artistically significant central Italian city of [[Urbino]] in the [[Marche]] region,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Urbino: The Story of a Renaissance City|first= June |last=Osborne|page=39 on the population, as a &quot;few thousand&quot; at most; even today it is only 15,000 without the students of the University}}&lt;/ref&gt; where his father [[Giovanni Santi]] was court painter to the Duke</span>
				<span class='text'>The reputation of the court had been established by [[Federico III da Montefeltro]], a highly successful [[condottiere]] who had been created [[Duke of Urbino]] by [[Pope Sixtus IV|the Pope]] - Urbino formed part of the [[Papal States]] - and who died the year before Raphael was born</span>
				<span class='text'>The emphasis of Federico's court was rather more literary than artistic, but Giovanni Santi was a poet of sorts as well as a painter, and had written a rhymed chronicle of the life of Federico, and both wrote the texts and produced the decor for [[masque]]-like court entertainments</span>
				<span class='text'>His poem to Federico shows him as keen to show awareness of the most advanced North Italian painters, and [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish artists]] as well</span>
				<span class='text'>In the very small court of Urbino he was probably more integrated into the central circle of the ruling family than most court painters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones and Penny, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>1-2&lt;/ref&gt;Federico was succeeded by his son [[Guidobaldo da Montefeltro]], who married [[Elisabetta Gonzaga]], daughter of the ruler of [[Mantua]], the most brilliant of the smaller Italian courts for both music and the visual arts</span>
				<span class='text'>Under them, the court continued as a centre for literary culture</span>
				<span class='text'>Growing up in the circle of this small court gave Raphael the excellent manners and social skills stressed by [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Vasari:207 &amp; passim&lt;/ref&gt; Court life in Urbino at just after this period was to become set as the model of the virtues of the Italian humanist court through [[Baldassare Castiglione]]'s depiction of it in his classic work ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'', published in 1528</span>
				<span class='text'>Castiglione moved to Urbino in 1504, when Raphael was no longer based there but frequently visited, and they became good friends</span>
				<span class='text'>He became close to other regular visitors to the court: [[Bernardo Dovizi|Pietro Bibbiena]] and [[Pietro Bembo]], both later [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], were already becoming well known as writers, and would be in Rome during Raphael's period there</span>
				<span class='text'>Raphael mixed easily in the highest circles throughout his life, one of the factors that tended to give a misleading impression of effortlessness to his career</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not receive a full [[Renaissance humanism|humanistic education]] however; it is unclear how easily he read Latin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny:204&lt;/ref&gt;==Early life and work==His mother Màgia died in 1491 when Raphael was eight, followed on August 1, 1494 by his father, who had already remarried</span>
				<span class='text'>Raphael was thus orphaned at eleven; his formal guardian became his only paternal uncle Bartolomeo, a priest, who subsequently engaged in litigation with his stepmother</span>
				<span class='text'>He probably continued to live with his stepmother when not staying as an apprentice with a master</span>
				<span class='text'>He had already shown talent, according to Vasari, who says that Raphael had been &quot;a great help to his father&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Vasari, at the start of the ''Life''</span>
				<span class='text'>Jones &amp; Penny:5&lt;/ref&gt; A brilliant [[self-portrait]] drawing from his teenage years shows his precocious talent</span>

				<span class='text'>bout</span>
				<span class='text'>om |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father's workshop continued and, probably together with his stepmother, Raphael evidently played a part in managing it from a very early age</span>
				<span class='text'>In Urbino, he came into contact with the works of [[Paolo Uccello]], previously the court painter (d</span>
				<span class='text'>1475), and [[Luca Signorelli]], who until 1498 was based in nearby [[Città di Castello]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones and Penny: 4-5, 8 and 20&lt;/ref&gt;According to Vasari, his father placed him in the workshop of the Umbrian master [[Pietro Perugino]] as an apprentice &quot;despite the tears of his mother&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The evidence of an apprenticeship comes only from Vasari and another source,&lt;ref&gt;Simone Fornari in 1549-50, see Gould:207&lt;/ref&gt; and has been disputed—eight was very early for an apprenticeship to begin</span>
				<span class='text'>An alternative theory is that he received at least some training from [[Timoteo Viti]], who acted as court painter in Urbino from 1495</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny:8&lt;/ref&gt; But most modern historians agree that Raphael at least worked as an assistant to Perugino from around 1500; the influence of Perugino on Raphael's early work is very clear: &quot;probably no other pupil of genius has ever absorbed so much of his master's teaching as Raphael did&quot;, according to [[Heinrich Wölfflin|Wölfflin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;contrasting him with Leonardo and Michelangelo in this respect</span>
				<span class='text'>Wölfflin:73&lt;/ref&gt; Vasari wrote that it was impossible to distinguish between their hands at this period, but many modern [[art historian]]s claim to do better and detect his hand in specific areas of works by Perugino or his workshop</span>
				<span class='text'>Apart from stylistic closeness, their techniques are very similar as well, for example having paint applied thickly, using an oil varnish medium, in shadows and darker garments, but very thinly on flesh areas</span>
				<span class='text'>An excess of resin in the varnish often causes cracking of areas of paint in the works of both masters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones and Penny:17&lt;/ref&gt; The Perugino workshop was active in both [[Perugia]] and [[Florence]], perhaps maintaining two permanent branches</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny:2-5&lt;/ref&gt; Raphael is described as a &quot;master&quot;, that is to say fully trained, in December 1500</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ettlinger &amp; Ettlinger:19&lt;/ref&gt;His first documented work was the ''[[Baronci altarpiece]]'' for the church of Saint [[Nicholas of Tolentino]] in Città di Castello, a town halfway between Perugia and Urbino</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ettlinger &amp; Ettlinger:20&lt;/ref&gt; Evangelista da Pian di Meleto, who had worked for his father, was also named in the commission</span>
				<span class='text'>It was commissioned in 1500 and finished in 1501; now only some cut sections and a preparatory drawing remain</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;It was later seriously damaged during an earthquake in 1789</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the following years he painted works for other churches there, including the ''[[Mond Crucifixion]]'' (about 1503) and the [[Pinacoteca di Brera|Brera]] ''[[The Marriage of the Virgin (Raphael)|Wedding of the Virgin]]'' (1504), and for Perugia, such as the ''[[Oddi altar (Raphael)|Oddi Altarpiece]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He very probably also visited Florence in this period</span>
				<span class='text'>These are large works, some in [[fresco]], where Raphael confidently marshals his compositions in the somewhat static style of Perugino</span>
				<span class='text'>He also painted many small and exquisite [[cabinet painting]]s in these years, probably mostly for the connoisseurs in the Urbino court, like the ''[[Three Graces (Raphael)|Three Graces]]'' and ''[[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Michael (Raphael)|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Michael]]'', and he began to paint [[Madonna (art)|Madonnas]] and portraits</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones and Penny:5-8&lt;/ref&gt; In 1502 he went to [[Siena]] at the invitation of another pupil of [[Perugino]], [[Pinturicchio]], &quot;being a friend of Raphael and knowing him to be a draughtsman of the highest quality&quot; to help with the [[cartoon]]s, and very likely the designs, for a fresco series in the [[Piccolomini Library]] in [[Siena Cathedral]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;One surviving preparatory drawing appears to be mostly by Raphael; quotation from Vasari by - Jones and Penny:20&lt;/ref&gt; He was evidently already much in demand even at this early stage in his career</span>

				<span class='text'>1506–7, [[National Gallery, London]] ]]Raphael led a &quot;nomadic&quot; life, working in various centres in Northern Italy, but spent a good deal of time in Florence, perhaps from about 1504</span>
				<span class='text'>Although there is traditional reference to a &quot;Florentine period&quot; of about 1504–8, he was possibly never a continuous resident there</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gould:207-8&lt;/ref&gt; He may have needed to visit the city to secure materials in any case</span>
				<span class='text'>There is a letter of recommendation of Raphael, dated October 1504, from the mother of the next Duke of Urbino to the [[Gonfaloniere of Florence]]: &quot;The bearer of this will be found to be Raphael, painter of Urbino, who, being greatly gifted in his profession has determined to spend some time in Florence to study</span>
				<span class='text'>And because his father was most worthy and I was very attached to him, and the son is a sensible and well-mannered young man, on both accounts, I bear him great love</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Penny:5&lt;/ref&gt;As earlier with Perugino and others, Raphael was able to assimilate the influence of Florentine art, whilst keeping his own developing style</span>
				<span class='text'>Frescos in Perugia of about 1505 show a new monumental quality in the figures which may represent the influence of [[Fra Bartolomeo]], who Vasari says was a friend of Raphael</span>
				<span class='text'>But the most striking influence in the work of these years is [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who returned to the city from 1500 to 1506</span>
				<span class='text'>Raphael's figures begin to take more dynamic and complex positions, and though as yet his painted subjects are still mostly tranquil, he made drawn studies of fighting nude men, one of the obsessions of the period in Florence</span>
				<span class='text'>Another drawing is a portrait of a young woman that uses the three-quarter length pyramidal composition of the just-completed ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', but still looks completely Raphaelesque</span>
				<span class='text'>Another of Leonardo's compositional inventions, the pyramidal ''Holy Family'', was repeated in a series of works that remain among his most famous easel paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>There is a drawing by Raphael in the [[Royal Collection]] of [[Leda and the Swan#In painting|Leonardo's lost ''Leda and the Swan'']], from which he adapted the [[contrapposto]] pose of his own ''Saint Catherine of Alexandria''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[National Gallery, London]] Jones &amp; Penny:44&lt;/ref&gt; He also perfects his own version of Leonardo's [[sfumato]] modelling, to give subtlety to his painting of flesh, and develops the interplay of glances between his groups, which are much less enigmatic than those of Leonardo</span>
				<span class='text'>But he keeps the soft clear light of Perugino in his paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny:21-45&lt;/ref&gt;Leonardo was more than thirty years older than Raphael, but Michelangelo, who was in Rome for this period, was just eight years his senior</span>
				<span class='text'>Michelangelo already disliked Leonardo, and in Rome came to dislike Raphael even more, attributing conspiracies against him to the younger man</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Vasari, Michelangelo:251&lt;/ref&gt; Raphael would have been aware of his works in Florence, but in his most original work of these years, he strikes out in a different direction</span>
				<span class='text'>His ''[[Deposition (Raphael)|Deposition of Christ]]'' draws on classical [[sarcophagi]] to spread the figures across the front of the picture space in a complex and not wholly successful arrangement</span>
				<span class='text'>Wöllflin detects the influence of the Madonna in Michelangelo's ''[[Doni Tondo]]'' in the kneeling figure on the right, but the rest of the composition is far removed from his style, or that of Leonardo</span>
				<span class='text'>Though highly regarded at the time, and much later forcibly removed from Perugia by the [[Borghese]], it stands rather alone in Raphael's work</span>
				<span class='text'>His classicism would later take a less literal direction</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|''[[The Deposition (Raphael)|Deposition of Christ]]'', 1507, drawing from Roman sarcophagi&lt;/gallery&gt;==Roman period=====The Vatican &quot;Stanze&quot;===By the end of 1508, he had moved to Rome, where he lived for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>He was invited by the new [[Pope Julius II]], perhaps at the suggestion of his architect [[Donato Bramante]], then engaged on St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter's, who came from just outside Urbino and was distantly related to Raphael</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny:49, differing somewhat from Gould:208 on the timing of his arrival&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Michelangelo, who had been kept hanging around in Rome for several months after his first summons,&lt;ref&gt;Vasari:247&lt;/ref&gt; Raphael was immediately commissioned by Julius to fresco what was intended to become the Pope's private library at the [[Vatican Palace]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;although Julius was no great reader—an inventory compiled after his death has a total of 220 books, large for the time, but hardly requiring such a receptacle</span>
				<span class='text'>There was no room for bookcases on the walls, which were in cases in the middle of the floor, destroyed in the 1527 Sack of Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>Jones &amp; Penny:4952&lt;/ref&gt; This was a much larger and more important commission than any he had received before; he had only painted one altarpiece in Florence itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Several other artists and their teams of assistants were already at work on different rooms, many painting over recently completed paintings commissioned by Julius's loathed predecessor, [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]], whose contributions, and [[coat of arms|arms]], Julius was determined to efface from the palace</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny:49&lt;/ref&gt; Michelangelo, meanwhile, had been commissioned to paint the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Raffael 072</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|''[[The Parnassus]]'', 1511, [[Stanza della Segnatura]]]]This first of the famous &quot;Stanze&quot; or &quot;[[Raphael Rooms]]&quot; to be painted, now always known as the ''[[Stanza della Segnatura]]'' after its use in Vasari's time, was to make a stunning impact on Roman art, and remains generally regarded as his greatest masterpiece, containing ''[[The School of Athens]]'', ''[[The Parnassus]]'' and the ''[[Disputation of the Holy Sacrament|Disputa]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Raphael was then given further rooms to paint, displacing other artists including Perugino and Signorelli</span>
				<span class='text'>He completed a sequence of three rooms, each with paintings on each wall and often the ceilings too, increasingly leaving the work of painting from his detailed drawings to the large and skilled workshop team he had acquired, who added a fourth room, probably only including some elements designed by Raphael, after his early death in 1520</span>
				<span class='text'>The death of Julius in 1513 did not interrupt the work at all, as he was succeeded by Raphael's last Pope, the [[Medici]] [[Pope Leo X]], with whom Raphael formed an even closer relationship, and who continued to commission him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny:49-128&lt;/ref&gt; Raphael's friend Cardinal Bibbiena was also one of Leo's old tutors, and a close friend and advisor</span>
				<span class='text'>aphael was clearly influenced by Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling in the course of painting the room</span>
				<span class='text'>Vasari said Bramante let him in secretly, and the scaffolding was taken down in 1511 from the first completed section</span>
				<span class='text'>The reaction of other artists to the daunting force of Michelangelo was the dominating question in Italian art for the following few decades, and Raphael, who had already shown his gift for absorbing influences into his own personal style, rose to the challenge perhaps better than any other artist</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the first and clearest instances was the portrait in ''The School of Athens'' of Michelangelo himself, as [[Heraclitus]], which seems to draw clearly from the Sybils and ''ignudi'' of the Sistine ceiling</span>
				<span class='text'>Other figures in that and later paintings in the room show the same influences, but as still cohesive with a development of Raphael's own style</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny:101-105&lt;/ref&gt; Michelangelo accused Raphael of plagiarism and years after Raphael's death, complained in a letter that &quot;everything he knew about art he got from me&quot;, although other quotations show more generous reactions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blunt:76, Jones &amp; Penny:103-5&lt;/ref&gt;These very large and complex compositions have been regarded ever since as among the supreme works of the [[grand manner]] of the High [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]], and the &quot;classic art&quot; of the post-antique West</span>
				<span class='text'>They give a highly [[idealism|idealised]] depiction of the forms represented, and the compositions, though very carefully conceived in [[drawing]]s, achieve &quot;sprezzatura&quot;, a term invented by his friend Castiglione, who defined it as &quot;a certain nonchalance which conceals all artistry and makes whatever one says or does seem uncontrived and effortless </span>

				<span class='text'>Other portraits were of his own friends, like Castiglione, or the immediate Papal circle</span>
				<span class='text'>Other rulers pressed for work, and King [[Francis I of France]] was sent two paintings as [[diplomatic gift]]s from the Pope</span>

				<span class='text'>He also designed some of the decoration for the Villa Madama, the work in both villas being executed by his workshop</span>
				<span class='text'>ne of his most important papal commissions was the [[Raphael Cartoons]] (now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]), a series of 10 [[cartoon]]s, of which seven survive, for tapestries with scenes of the lives of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]] and [[Saint Peter]], for the [[Sistine Chapel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The cartoons were sent to [[Brussels]] to be woven in the workshop of [[Pier van Aelst]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is possible that Raphael saw the finished series before his death—they were probably completed in 1520</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny:133-147&lt;/ref&gt; He also designed and painted the ''[[Vatican loggias|Loggie]]'' at the Vatican, a long thin gallery then open to a courtyard on one side, decorated with Roman-style [[grottesche]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny:192-197&lt;/ref&gt; He produced a number of significant altarpieces, including [[The Ecstasy of St</span>

				<span class='text'>His last work, on which he was working up to his death, was a large ''[[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Transfiguration]]'', which together with ''[[Christ Falling on the Way to Calvary (Raphael)|Il Spasimo]]'' shows the direction his art was taking in his final years—more proto-[[Baroque]] than [[Mannerist]]</span>

				<span class='text'>507  ]]Vasari says that Raphael eventually had a workshop of fifty pupils and assistants, many of whom later became significant artists in their own right</span>
				<span class='text'>This was arguably the largest workshop team assembled under any single [[old master]] painter, and much higher than the norm</span>
				<span class='text'>They included established masters from other parts of Italy, probably working with their own teams as sub-contractors, as well as pupils and journeymen</span>
				<span class='text'>We have very little evidence of the internal working arrangements of the workshop, apart from the works of art themselves, often very difficult to assign to a particular hand</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones and Penny:146-147, 196-197, and Pon:82-85&lt;/ref&gt;The most important figures were [[Giulio Romano]], a young pupil from Rome (only about twenty-one at Raphael's death), and [[Gianfrancesco Penni]], already a Florentine master</span>
				<span class='text'>They were left many of Raphael's drawings and other possessions, and to some extent continued the workshop after Raphael's death</span>
				<span class='text'>Penni did not achieve a personal reputation equal to Giulio's, as after Raphael's death he became Giulio's less-than-equal collaborator in turn for much of his subsequent career</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Perino del Vaga]], already a master, and [[Polidoro da Caravaggio]], who was supposedly promoted from a labourer carrying building materials on the site, also became notable painters in their own right</span>
				<span class='text'>Polidoro's partner, [[Maturino da Firenze]], has, like Penni, been overshadowed in subsequent reputation by his partner</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Giovanni da Udine]] had a more independent status, and was responsible for the decorative [[stucco]] work and grotesques surrounding the main frescoes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones and Penny:147, 196&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the artists were later scattered, and some killed, by the violent [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome in 1527]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Vasari:207 &amp; 231&lt;/ref&gt; However though both Penni and Giulio were sufficiently skilled that distinguishing between their hands and that of Raphael himself is still sometimes difficult,&lt;ref&gt;See for example, the [[Raphael Cartoons]]&lt;/ref&gt; there is no doubt that many of Raphael's later wall-paintings, and probably some of his easel paintings, are more notable for their design than their execution</span>

				<span class='text'>Most of his work there was altered or demolished after his death and the acceptance of Michelangelo's design, but a few drawings have survived</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny:215-218&lt;/ref&gt;He designed several other buildings, and for a short time was the most important architect in Rome, working for a small circle around the Papacy</span>
				<span class='text'>Julius had made changes to the street plan of Rome, creating several new thoroughfares, and he wanted them filled with splendid palaces</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny:210-211&lt;/ref&gt;An important building, the [[Palazzo Branconio dell'Aquila]] for Leo's Papal [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] [[Giovanbattista Branconio dell'Aquila|Giovanni Battista Branconio]], was completely destroyed to make way for [[Bernini]]'s ''piazza'' for St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter's, but drawings of the façade and courtyard remain</span>
				<span class='text'>The façade was an unusually richly decorated one for the period, including both painted panels on the top story (of three), and much sculpture on the middle one</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny:221-222&lt;/ref&gt;The main designs for the Villa Farnesina were not by Raphael, but he did design, and paint, the [[Chigi Chapel]] for the same patron, [[Agostino Chigi]], the Papal Treasurer</span>
				<span class='text'>Another building, for Pope Leo's doctor, the ''Palazzo di Jacobo da Brescia'', was moved in the 1930s but survives; this was designed to complement a palace on the same street by Bramante, where Raphael himself lived for a time</span>

				<span class='text'>Even incomplete, it was the most sophisticated villa design yet seen in Italy, and greatly influenced the later development of the genre; it appears to be the only modern building in Rome of which [[Palladio]] made a measured drawing</span>

				<span class='text'>According to a near-contemporary, when beginning to plan a composition, he would lay out a large number of stock drawings of his on the floor, and begin to draw &quot;rapidly&quot;, borrowing figures from here and there</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Giovanni Battista Armenini]] (1533-1609) ''De vera precetti della pittura''(1587), quoted Pon:115&lt;/ref&gt; Over forty sketches survive for the ''Disputa'' in the Stanze, and there may well have been many more originally; over four hundred sheets survive altogether</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jones &amp; Penny:58 &amp; ff; 400 from Pon:114&lt;/ref&gt; He used different drawings to refine his poses and compositions, apparently to a greater extent than most other painters, to judge by the number of variants that survive: &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>This is how Raphael himself, who was so rich in inventiveness, used to work, always coming up with four or six ways to show a narrative, each one different from the rest, and all of them full of grace and well done</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; wrote another writer after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ludovico Dolce (1508-68), from his ''L'Aretino'' of 1557, quoted Pon:114&lt;/ref&gt; For [[John Shearman]], Raphael's art marks &quot;a shift of resources away from production to research and development&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;quoted Pon:114, from lecture on ''The Organization of Raphael's Workshop'', pub</span>
				<span class='text'>Chicago, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;When a final composition was achieved, scaled-up full-size cartoons were often made, which were then pricked with a pin and &quot;pounced&quot; with a bag of soot to leave dotted lines on the surface as a guide</span>
				<span class='text'>He also made unusually extensive use, on both paper and plaster, of a &quot;blind stylus&quot;, scratching lines which leave only an indentation, but no mark</span>
				<span class='text'>These can be seen on the wall in ''The School of Athens'', and in the originals of many drawings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Not surprisingly, photographs do not show these well, if at all</span>
				<span class='text'>Leonardo sometimes used a blind stylus to outline his final choice from a tangle of different outlines in the same drawing</span>
				<span class='text'>Pon:106-110</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Raphael Cartoons&quot;, as tapestry designs, were fully coloured in a glue [[Distemper (paint)|distemper]] medium, as they were sent to Brussels to be followed by the weavers</span>
				<span class='text'>n later works painted by the workshop, the drawings are often painfully more attractive than the paintings</span>

				<span class='text'>4, Royal Collection Publications, 2007, ISBN 978-1-902163-29-1&lt;/ref&gt; Most Raphael drawings are rather precise—even initial sketches with naked outline figures are carefully drawn, and later working drawings often have a high degree of finish, with shading and sometimes highlights in white</span>
				<span class='text'>They lack the freedom and energy of some of Leonardo's and Michelangelo's sketches, but are nearly always aesthetically very satisfying</span>
				<span class='text'>He was one of the last artists to use [[metalpoint]] (literally a sharp pointed piece of silver or another metal) extensively, although he also made superb use of the freer medium of red or black chalk</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pon:104&lt;/ref&gt; In his final years he was one of the first artists to use female models for preparatory drawings—male pupils (&quot;garzoni&quot;) were normally used for studies of both sexes</span>

				<span class='text'>See also a lengthy analysis in: Landau:118 ff&lt;/ref&gt; A total of about fifty prints were made; some were copies of Raphael's paintings, but other designs were apparently created by Raphael purely to be turned into prints</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The enigmatic relationship is discussed at length by both Landau and Pon in her Chapters 3 and 4</span>

				<span class='text'>He never married, but in 1514 became engaged to Maria Bibbiena, Cardinal Medici Bibbiena's niece; he seems to have been talked into this by his friend the Cardinal, and his lack of enthusiasm seems to be shown by the marriage not having taken place before she died in 1520</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Vasari:230-231&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to have had many affairs, but a permanent fixture in his life in Rome was &quot;La Fornarina&quot;, [[Margarita Luti|Margherita Luti]], the daughter of a baker (''fornaro'') named Francesco Luti from Siena who lived at Via del Governo Vecchio</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Art historians and doctors debate whether the right hand on the left breast in ''[[La Fornarina]]'' reveal a cancerous breast tumour detailed and disguised in a classic pose of love</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was made a &quot;[[Valet de chambre|Groom of the Chamber]]&quot; of the Pope, which gave him status at court and an additional income, and also a knight of the Papal [[Order of the Golden Spur]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Vasari claims he had toyed with the ambition of becoming a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]], perhaps after some encouragement from Leo, which also may account for his delaying his marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;According to Vasari, Raphael's premature death on [[Good Friday]] (April 6, 1520), which was possibly his 37th birthday, was caused by a night of excessive sex with Luti, after which he fell into a fever and, not telling his doctors that this was its cause, was given the wrong cure, which killed him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Various other historians provide different theories: [[Bernardino Ramazzini]] (1700), in his ''De morbis artificum'', noted that painters at the time generally led “sedentary lives and melancholic disposition” and often worked “with mercury- and lead-based materials</span>
				<span class='text'> Bufarale (1915) “diagnosed pneumonia or a military fever” while Portigliotti suggested “pulmonary disease</span>
				<span class='text'> Joannides has stated that “Raphael died of over-work</span>
				<span class='text'>Note also that Raphael's age at death is also debated by some, with Michiel asserting that Raphael died at thirty-four, while Pandolfo Pico and Girolamo Lippomano arguing that Raphael died at thirty-three</span>
				<span class='text'>For all see: Shearman:573</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Vasari also says that Raphael had also been born on a Good Friday, which in 1483 fell on March 28</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Whereas Michiel said he died on his birthday</span>
				<span class='text'>Art historian John Shearman addressed this apparent discrepancy: &quot;The time of death can be calculated from the convention of counting from sundown, which Michaelis puts at 6</span>
				<span class='text'>6 on Friday 6 April, plus half-an-hour to Ave Maria, plus three hours, that is, soon after 10</span>
				<span class='text'>0 pm</span>
				<span class='text'>The coincidence noted between the birth-date and death-date is usually thought in this case (since it refers to the Friday and Saturday in Holy Week, the movable feast rather than the day of the month) to fortify the argument that Raphael was also born on Good Friday, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> 28 March 1483</span>
				<span class='text'>But there is a notable ambiguity in Michiel’s note, not often noticed: ''Morse [[…]] Venerdi Santo venendo il Sabato, giorno della sua Nativita'', may also be taken to mean that his birthday was on Saturday, and in that case the awareness could as well be the date, thus producing a birth-date of 7 April 1483</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Shearman:573</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Whatever the cause, in his acute illness, which lasted fifteen days, Raphael was composed enough to confess his sins, receive the [[last rites]], and to put his affairs in order</span>
				<span class='text'>He dictated his will, in which he left sufficient funds for his mistress's care, entrusted to his loyal servant Baviera, and left most of his studio contents to Giulio Romano and Penni</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>as generally held in the middle of the sixteenth century that Raphael was the ideal balanced painter, universal in his talent, satisfying all the absolute standards, and obeying all the rules which were supposed to govern the arts, whereas Michelangelo was the eccentric genius, more brilliant than any other artists in his particular field, the drawing of the male nude, but unbalanced and lacking in certain qualities, such as grace and restraint, essential to the great artist</span>
				<span class='text'>Those, like [[Lodovico Dolce|Dolce]] and [[Pietro Aretino|Aretino]], who held this view were usually the survivors of [[Renaissance Humanism]], unable to follow Michelangelo as he moved on into Mannerism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blunt:76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Vasari himself, despite his hero remaining Michelangelo, came to see his influence as harmful in some ways, and added passages to the second edition of the ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives]]'' expressing similar views</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|260px|Raphael's sarcophagus]]Raphael's compositions were always admired and studied, and became the cornerstone of the [[Academic art|training of the Academies of art]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His period of greatest influence was from the late 17th to late 19th centuries, when his perfect decorum and balance were greatly admired</span>
				<span class='text'>He was seen as the best model for the [[history painting]], regarded as the highest in the [[hierarchy of genres]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] in his ''Discourses'' praised his &quot;simple, grave, and majestic dignity&quot; and said he &quot;stands in general foremost of the first [i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> best] painters&quot;, especially for his frescoes (in which he included the &quot;Raphael Cartoons&quot;), whereas &quot;Michael Angelo claims the next attention</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not possess so many excellences as Raffaelle, but those he had were of the highest kind</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Echoing the sixteenth-century views above, Reynolds goes on to say of Raphael:&lt;blockquote&gt;The excellency of this extraordinary man lay in the propriety, beauty, and majesty of his characters, his judicious contrivance of his composition, correctness of drawing, purity of taste, and the skilful accommodation of other men’s conceptions to his own purpose</span>
				<span class='text'>Nobody excelled him in that judgment, with which he united to his own observations on nature the energy of Michael Angelo, and the beauty and simplicity of the antique</span>
				<span class='text'>To the question, therefore, which ought to hold the first rank, Raffaelle or Michael Angelo, it must be answered, that if it is to be given to him who possessed a greater combination of the higher qualities of the art than any other man, there is no doubt but Raffaelle is the first</span>
				<span class='text'>But if, according to [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]], the sublime, being the highest excellence that human composition can attain to, abundantly compensates the absence of every other beauty, and atones for all other deficiencies, then Michael Angelo demands the preference</span>

				<span class='text'>tm Online text of Reynold's Discourses] The whole passage is worth reading</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Reynolds was less enthusiastic about Raphael's panel paintings, but the slight sentimentality of these made them enormously popular in the 19th century: &quot;We have been familiar with them from childhood onwards, through a far greater mass of reproductions than any other artist in the world has ever had</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot; wrote [[Heinrich Wölfflin|Wölfflin]], who was born in 1862, of Raphael's Madonnas</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wölfflin:82,&lt;/ref&gt;In Germany Raphael had an immense influence on religious art of the [[Nazarene movement]] and [[Düsseldorf school of painting]] in the 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast in England the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] explicitly reacted against his influence (and that of his admirers such as &quot;Sir Sploshua&quot;), seeking to return to styles before what they saw as his baneful influence</span>
				<span class='text'>According to a critic whose ideas greatly influenced them, [[John Ruskin]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;The doom of the arts of Europe went forth from that chamber [the Stanza della Segnatura], and it was brought about in great part by the very excellencies of the man who had thus marked the commencement of decline</span>
				<span class='text'>The perfection of execution and the beauty of feature which were attained in his works, and in those of his great contemporaries, rendered finish of execution and beauty of form the chief objects of all artists; and thenceforward execution was looked for rather than thought, and beauty rather than veracity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;And as I told you, these are the two secondary causes of the decline of art; the first being the loss of moral purpose</span>
				<span class='text'>Pray note them clearly</span>
				<span class='text'>In mediæval art, thought is the first thing, execution the second; in modern art execution is the first thing, and thought the second</span>
				<span class='text'>And again, in mediæval art, truth is first, beauty second; in modern art, beauty is first, truth second</span>
				<span class='text'>The mediæval principles led up to Raphael, and the modern principles lead down from him</span>
