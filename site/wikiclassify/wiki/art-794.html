				<span class='text'>His papers were distributed among various city and university libraries, with the largest collection held in the Mencken Room at the central branch of Baltimore's [[Enoch Pratt Free Library]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Early life==Mencken was born in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], on September 12, 1880</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the son of [[August Mencken, Sr</span>
				<span class='text'>], a [[cigar]] factory owner of [[German American|German ancestry]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When Henry was three, his family moved into a new home at 1524 Hollins Street facing  Union Square park in the [[Union Square, Baltimore|Union Square]] neighborhood of old West Baltimore</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In his best-selling memoir ''[[Happy Days, 1880‚Äì1892|Happy Days]]'', he described his childhood in Baltimore as &quot;placid, secure, uneventful and happy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Happy Days'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>vii&lt;/ref&gt;When he was nine years old, he read [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|Huckleberry Finn]]'', which he later described as &quot;the most stupendous event in my life&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;St</span>
				<span class='text'>Petersburg Times&amp;nbsp;‚Äì September 23, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; He became determined to become a writer himself, and read voraciously</span>
				<span class='text'>In one winter while in high school he read [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]] and then &quot;proceeded backward to [[Joseph Addison|Addison]], [[Richard Steele|Steele]], [[Alexander Pope|Pope]], [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]] and the other magnificos of the Eighteenth century&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He read the entire canon of Shakespeare, and became an ardent fan of [[Kipling]] and [[Thomas Huxley]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Goldberg | 1925 | pp = 90‚Äì3}}  As a boy, Mencken also had practical interests, photography and chemistry in particular, and eventually had a home chemistry laboratory which he used to perform experiments of his own devising, some of them inadvertently dangerous</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Newspaper Days, 1899‚Äì1906'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>58&lt;/ref&gt;He began his primary education in the mid-1880s at Professor Knapp's School located on the east side of Holliday Street between East Lexington and Fayette Streets, next to the [[Holliday Street Theatre]] and across from the newly constructed [[Baltimore City Hall]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The site today is the War Memorial and City Hall Plaza laid out in 1926 in memory of World War I dead</span>
				<span class='text'> At fifteen, in June 1896, he graduated as valedictorian from the [[Baltimore Polytechnic Institute]]</span>
				<span class='text'>BPI was a mathematics, technical and science-oriented public high school, founded in 1883, which was then located on old Courtland Street just north of East Saratoga Street</span>

				<span class='text'>e worked for three years in his father's cigar factory</span>
				<span class='text'>He disliked the work, especially the sales aspect of it, and resolved to leave, with or without his father's blessing</span>
				<span class='text'>In early 1898 he took a class in writing at one of the country's first correspondence schools (the Cosmopolitan University)</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn | Goldberg | 1925 | p = 93}}  This was to be the entirety of Mencken's formal education in journalism, or indeed in any other subject</span>
				<span class='text'>On his father's death a few days after Christmas in the same year, the business reverted to his uncle and Mencken was free to pursue his career in journalism</span>
				<span class='text'>He had applied in February 1899 to the ''Morning Herald'' newspaper (which became the ''[[Baltimore Morning Herald]]'' in 1900), and had been hired as a part-timer there, but still kept his position at the factory for a few months</span>
				<span class='text'> In June he was hired on as a full-time reporter</span>
				<span class='text'>=Career==Mencken served as a reporter for six years at the ''Herald</span>
				<span class='text'>' Less than two and a half years after the [[Great Baltimore Fire]], the paper was purchased in June 1906 by [[Charles H</span>
				<span class='text'>Grasty]], owner/editor of ''[[Baltimore News-American|The News]]'' since 1892, and competing owner/publisher Gen</span>
				<span class='text'>Felix Agnus, of the town's oldest (since 1773) and largest daily ''[[Baltimore News-American|The Baltimore American]]</span>
				<span class='text'>' They proceeded to divide up the staff, assets and resources of ''The Herald'' between them</span>
				<span class='text'> Mencken then moved to ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', where he worked for Charles H</span>
				<span class='text'>Grasty</span>
				<span class='text'>He continued to contribute to  ''The Sun,''  ''The Evening Sun'' (founded 1910) and ''The Sunday Sun'' full-time until 1948, when he ceased to write following a [[stroke]]</span>
				<span class='text'>encken began writing the editorials and opinion pieces that made his name at ''The Sun</span>
				<span class='text'>' On the side, he wrote short stories, a novel, and even poetry‚Äìwhich he later revealed</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1908, he became a literary critic for the magazine ''[[The Smart Set]]'', and in 1924, he and [[George Jean Nathan]] founded and edited ''[[The American Mercury]]'', published by [[Alfred A</span>
				<span class='text'>Knopf]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It soon developed a national circulation and became highly influential on college campuses across America</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1933, Mencken resigned as editor</span>
				<span class='text'>=Personal life=====Marriage===In 1930, Mencken married [[Sara Haardt]], a [[German American]] professor of English at [[Goucher College]] in Baltimore and an author eighteen years his junior</span>
				<span class='text'>Haardt had led efforts in Alabama to ratify the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The two met in 1923, after Mencken delivered a lecture at Goucher; a seven-year courtship ensued</span>
				<span class='text'>The marriage made national headlines, and many were surprised that Mencken, who once called marriage &quot;the end of hope&quot; and who was well known for mocking relations between the sexes, had gone to the altar</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The Holy Spirit informed and inspired me,&quot; Mencken said</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Like all other infidels, I am superstitious and always follow hunches: this one seemed to be a superb one</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Even more startling, he was marrying an Alabama native, despite his having written scathing essays about the [[American South]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Haardt was in poor health from [[tuberculosis]] throughout their marriage and died in 1935 of [[meningitis]], leaving Mencken grief-stricken</span>

				<span class='text'>He ceased writing for the Baltimore ''Sun'' for several years, focusing on his memoirs and other projects as editor, while serving as an adviser for the paper that had been his home for nearly his entire career</span>

				<span class='text'>==Last days===On November 23, 1948, Mencken suffered a [[stroke]] that left him aware and fully conscious but nearly unable to read or write, and able to speak only with some difficulty</span>
				<span class='text'>After his stroke, Mencken enjoyed listening to [[Classical music|European classical music]] and, after some recovery of his ability to speak, talking with friends, but he sometimes referred to himself in the past tense, as if already dead</span>
				<span class='text'> During the last year of his life, his friend and biographer [[William Manchester]] read to him daily</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;}}==The man of ideas==In his capacity as editor and man of ideas, Mencken became close friends with the leading literary figures of his time, including [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[F</span>

				<span class='text'>Knopf (person)|Alfred Knopf]], as well as a mentor to several young reporters, including [[Alistair Cooke]]</span>
				<span class='text'> He also championed artists whose works he considered worthy</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, he asserted that books such as ''Caught Short! A Saga of Wailing Wall Street'' (1929), by [[Eddie Cantor]] (ghost-written by [[David Freedman]]) did more to pull America out of the [[Great Depression]] than all government measures combined</span>
				<span class='text'>He also mentored [[John Fante]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] illustrated an edition of Mencken's book ''Europe After 8:15''</span>
				<span class='text'>encken also published many works under various pseudonyms, including [[Owen Hatteras]], John H Brownell, William Drayham, WLD Bell, and Charles Angoff</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As a ghost-writer for the physician Leonard K Hirshberg, he wrote a series of articles and (in 1910) most of a book about the care of babies</span>
				<span class='text'>encken admired German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]‚Äîhe was the first writer to provide a scholarly analysis in English of Nietzsche's views and writings‚Äîand [[Joseph Conrad]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His humor and satire owe much to [[Ambrose Bierce]] and [[Mark Twain]]</span>
				<span class='text'> He did much to defend [[Dreiser]], despite freely admitting his faults, including stating forthrightly that Dreiser often wrote badly and was a gullible man</span>
				<span class='text'>Mencken also expressed his appreciation for [[William Graham Sumner]] in a 1941 collection of Sumner's essays, and regretted never having known Sumner personally</span>
				<span class='text'> In contrast, Mencken was scathing in his criticism of the German philosopher [[Hans Vaihinger]] whom he described as &quot;an extremely dull author&quot; and whose famous book ''Philosophy of 'As If''' he dismissed as an unimportant &quot;foot-note to all existing systems</span>

				<span class='text'>He believed that every community produced a few people of clear superiority</span>
				<span class='text'>He considered groupings on a par with hierarchies, which led to a kind of natural [[elitism]] and natural [[aristocracy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Superior&quot; individuals, in Mencken's view, were those wrongly oppressed and disdained by their own communities, but nevertheless distinguished by their will and personal achievement‚Äînot by race or birth</span>

				<span class='text'>Mencken said, &quot;There is no other Jew in Baltimore who seems suitable,&quot; according to the article</span>
				<span class='text'>And the diary quoted him as saying of blacks, in September 1943, &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>t is impossible to talk anything resembling discretion or judgment to a colored woman</span>
				<span class='text'>They are all essentially child-like, and even hard experience does not teach them anything</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; However, Mencken opposed [[lynching]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, he had this to say about a Maryland incident:{{quote|Not a single bigwig came forward in the emergency, though the whole town knew what was afoot</span>
				<span class='text'>Any one of a score of such bigwigs might have halted the crime, if only by threatening to denounce its perpetrators, but none spoke</span>
				<span class='text'>So Williams was duly hanged, burned and mutilated</span>
				<span class='text'>}Mencken also wrote: &quot;I admit freely enough that, by careful breeding, supervision of environment and education, extending over many generations, it might be possible to make an appreciable improvement in the stock of the American negro, for example, but I must maintain that this enterprise would be a ridiculous waste of energy, for there is a high-caste white stock ready at hand, and it is inconceivable that the negro stock, however carefully it might be nurtured, could ever even remotely approach it</span>
				<span class='text'>The educated negro of today is a failure, not because he meets insuperable difficulties in life, but because he is a negro</span>
				<span class='text'>He is, in brief, a low-caste man, to the manner born, and he will remain inert and inefficient until fifty generations of him have lived in civilization</span>
				<span class='text'>And even then, the superior white race will be fifty generations ahead of him</span>

				<span class='text'>Mencken, Individualist [1910], p</span>
				<span class='text'>116&lt;/ref&gt;===Democracy===Rather than dismissing [[democratic governance]] as a [[Argumentum ad populum|popular fallacy]] or treating it with open contempt, Mencken's response to it was a publicized sense of amusement</span>
				<span class='text'>His feelings on this subject (like his casual feelings on many other such subjects) are sprinkled throughout his writings over the years, very occasionally taking center-stage with the full force of Mencken's prose:{{quote|Democracy gives [the beatification of mediocrity] a certain appearance of objective and demonstrable truth</span>
				<span class='text'>The mob man, functioning as citizen, gets a feeling that he is really important to the world‚Äîthat he is genuinely running things</span>
				<span class='text'>Out of his maudlin herding after rogues and [[Charlatan|mountebanks]] there comes to him a sense of vast and mysterious power‚Äîwhich is what makes archbishops, police sergeants, the grand [[goblin]]s of the [[Ku Klux Klan|Ku Klux]] and other such magnificoes happy</span>
				<span class='text'>And out of it there comes, too, a conviction that he is somehow wise, that his views are taken seriously by his betters‚Äîwhich is what makes United States Senators, fortune tellers and Young Intellectuals happy</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, there comes out of it a glowing consciousness of a high duty triumphantly done which is what makes hangmen and husbands happy</span>
				<span class='text'>}This sentiment is fairly consistent with Mencken's distaste for common notions and the philosophical outlook he unabashedly set down throughout his life as a writer (drawing on Friedrich Nietzsche and [[Herbert Spencer]], among others)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>igeye</span>
				<span class='text'>om/mencken</span>
				<span class='text'>tm Mencken's essay &quot;Last Words&quot; on the illusory merits of democracy</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;Mencken wrote as follows about the difficulties of good men reaching national office when such campaigns must necessarily be conducted remotely:{{quote|The larger the mob, the harder the test</span>
				<span class='text'>In small areas, before small electorates, a first-rate man occasionally fights his way through, carrying even the mob with him by force of his personality</span>
				<span class='text'>But when the field is nationwide, and the fight must be waged chiefly at second and third hand, and the force of personality cannot so readily make itself felt, then all the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre‚Äîthe man who can most easily adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum</span>
				<span class='text'>he Presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men</span>
				<span class='text'>As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people</span>
				<span class='text'>We move toward a lofty ideal</span>
				<span class='text'>On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mencken, Baltimore ''Evening Sun'', July 26, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;}}===Science===Mencken supported biology and the theory of evolution by Charles Darwin, but spoke unfavorably of physics and mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>In Charles Angoff‚Äôs record, Mencken said:{{quote|[Isaac Newton] was a mathematician, which is mostly hogwash, too</span>
				<span class='text'>Imagine measuring infinity! That's a laugh</span>

				<span class='text'>141&lt;/ref&gt;}}In response Angoff said ‚ÄúWell, without mathematics there wouldn't be any engineering, no chemistry, no physics</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù Mencken responded: ‚ÄúThat's true, but it's reasonable mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>Addition, subtraction, multiplication, fractions, division, that's what real mathematics is</span>
				<span class='text'>The rest is baloney</span>

				<span class='text'>Peirce in the ''American Mercury''</span>
				<span class='text'>‚ÄúSo you believe in that garbage, too ‚Äî theories of knowledge, infinity, laws of probability</span>

				<span class='text'>194&lt;/ref&gt;Mencken also repeated these opinions multiple times in articles for the ''American Mercury''</span>
				<span class='text'>He said mathematics is simply a fiction, compared with individual facts that make up science</span>
				<span class='text'>In a review for Vaihinger's ''The Philosophy of &quot;As If‚Äù'', he said:{{quote|The human mind, at its present stage of development, cannot function without the aid of fictions, but neither can it function without the aid of facts -- save, perhaps, when it is housed in the skull of a university professor of philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the two, the facts are enormously the more important</span>
				<span class='text'>In certain metaphysical fields, e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>those of mathematics, law, theology, osteopathy and ethics -- the fiction will probably hold out for many years, but elsewhere the fact slowly ousts it, and that ousting is what is called intellectual progress</span>
				<span class='text'>Very few fictions remain in use in anatomy, or in plumbing and gas-fitting; they have even begun to disappear from economics</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}Mencken also wrote a review for Eddington‚Äôs book, ''The Mysterious Universe'', in which he said that mathematics is not necessary for physics</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead of ‚Äúmathematical speculation‚Äù, Mencken believed physicists should just directly look at the facts in the laboratory like chemists:{{quote|If chemists were similarly given to fanciful and mystical guessing, they would have hatched a quantum theory forty years ago to account for the variations that they observed in atomic weights</span>
				<span class='text'>But they kept on plugging away in their laboratories without calling in either mathematicians or theologians to aid them, and eventually they discovered the isotopes, and what had been chaos was reduced to the most exact sort of order</span>

				<span class='text'>One of the most absurd of all spiritualists is Sir Oliver Lodge</span>

				<span class='text'>As commonly encountered, they lack many of the qualities that mark the civilized man: courage, dignity, incorruptibility, ease, confidence</span>
				<span class='text'>They have vanity without pride, voluptuousness without taste, and learning without wisdom</span>

				<span class='text'>On November 27, 1938, Mencken writes (''[[Baltimore Sun]]''), &quot;It is to be hoped that the poor Jews now being robbed and mauled in Germany will not take too seriously the plans of various politicians to rescue them</span>
