				<span class='text'>When Elijah finds her and asks to be fed, she says that she does not have sufficient food to keep her and her own son alive</span>
				<span class='text'>Elijah tells her that God will not allow her supply of flour or oil to run out, saying, &quot;Don't be afraid</span>
				<span class='text'>this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: 'The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the Lord gives rain on the land</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; She feeds him the last of their food, and Elijah's promise miraculously comes true; thus, by an act of faith the woman received the promised blessing</span>
				<span class='text'>God gave her &quot;[[manna]]&quot; from heaven even while he was withholding food from his unfaithful people in the promised land</span>
				<span class='text'>Some time later the widow's son dies and the widow cries, &quot;Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?&quot; Moved by a faith like that of [[Abraham]] (Romans 4:17, Hebrews 11:19), Elijah prays that God might restore her son so that the veracity and trustworthiness of God's word might be demonstrated</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|17:22|HE}} relates how God &quot;heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This is the first instance of raising the dead recorded in Scripture</span>
				<span class='text'>This non-Israelite widow was granted the best covenant blessing in the person of her son, the only hope for a widow in ancient society</span>
				<span class='text'>The widow cried, &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he word of the Lord from your mouth is the truth</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; She made a confession that the Israelites had failed to make</span>
				<span class='text'>fter more than three years of drought and famine, God tells Elijah to return to Ahab and announce the end of the drought: not occasioned by repentance in Israel but by the command of the Lord, who had determined to reveal himself again to his people</span>
				<span class='text'>While on his way, Elijah meets [[Obadiah (1 Kings)|Obadiah]], the head of Ahab's household, who had hidden a hundred prophets of the [[Yahweh|God of Israel]] when Ahab and Jezebel had been killing them</span>

				<span class='text'>Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in Charleston, South Carolina]]When Ahab confronts Elijah, he refers to him as the &quot;troubler of Israel</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Elijah responds by throwing the charge back at Ahab, saying that it is Ahab who has troubled Israel by allowing the worship of [[false god]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>Elijah then berates both the people of Israel and Ahab for their acquiescence in Baal worship</span>
				<span class='text'>‚ÄúHow long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal then follow him‚Äù ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:21|HE}})</span>
				<span class='text'>And the people were silent</span>
				<span class='text'>The Hebrew for this word, &quot;go limping&quot; or &quot;waver&quot;, is the same as that used for &quot;danced&quot; in verse 26, where the prophets of Baal frantically dance</span>
				<span class='text'>Elijah speaks with sharp irony: in the religious ambivalence of Israel, he is portraying here as engaging in a wild and futile religious &quot;dance&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>t this point Elijah proposes a direct test of the powers of Baal and Yahweh</span>
				<span class='text'>The people of Israel, 450 prophets of Baal, and 400 prophets of [[Asherah]] are summoned to [[Mount Carmel, Israel|Mount Carmel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Two altars are built, one for Baal and one for Yahweh</span>
				<span class='text'>Wood is laid on the altars</span>
				<span class='text'>Two oxen are slaughtered and cut into pieces; the pieces are laid on the wood</span>
				<span class='text'>Elijah then invites the priests of Baal to pray for fire to light the sacrifice</span>
				<span class='text'>They pray from morning to noon without success</span>
				<span class='text'>Elijah ridicules their efforts</span>
				<span class='text'>They respond by cutting themselves and adding their own blood to the sacrifice (such mutilation of the body was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic law)</span>
				<span class='text'>They continue praying until evening without success</span>
				<span class='text'>lijah now orders that the altar of Yahweh be drenched with water from &quot;four large jars&quot; poured three times ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:33‚Äì34|NIV}})</span>
				<span class='text'>He asks God to accept the sacrifice</span>
				<span class='text'>Fire falls from the sky, consuming the water, the sacrifice and the stones of the altar itself as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Elijah then orders the death of the prophets of Baal</span>
				<span class='text'>Elijah prays earnestly for rain to fall again on the land</span>
				<span class='text'>Then the rains begin, signaling the end of the famine</span>
				<span class='text'>=== Mount Horeb ====[[Jezebel (Bible)|Jezebel]], enraged that Elijah had ordered the deaths of her priests, threatens to kill Elijah ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:1‚Äì13|HE}})</span>
				<span class='text'>Later Elijah would prophesy about Jezebel's death, because of her sin</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, Elijah flees to [[Beersheba]] in [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], continues alone into the wilderness, and finally sits down under a [[Retama]]ine shrub, praying for death</span>
				<span class='text'>He falls asleep under the tree; the [[angel of the Lord]] touches him and tells him to wake up and eat</span>
				<span class='text'>When he awakens he finds bread and a jar of water</span>
				<span class='text'>He eats, drinks, and goes back to sleep</span>
				<span class='text'>The angel comes a second time and tells him to eat and drink because he has a long journey ahead of him</span>
				<span class='text'>lijah travels for forty days and forty nights to [[Mount Horeb]], where [[Moses]] had received the [[Ten Commandments]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Elijah is the only person described in the Bible as returning to Horeb, after Moses and his generation had left Horeb several centuries before</span>
				<span class='text'>He seeks shelter in a [[Cave of Elijah|cave]]</span>
				<span class='text'>God again speaks to Elijah ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:9|HE}}): &quot;What doest thou here, Elijah?&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Elijah did not give a direct answer to the Lord's question but evades and equivocates, implying that the work the Lord had begun centuries earlier had now come to nothing, and that his own work was fruitless</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike Moses, who tried to defend Israel when they sinned with the golden calf, Elijah bitterly complains over the Israelites' unfaithfulness and says he is the &quot;only one left&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Up until this time Elijah has only the word of God to guide him, but now he is told to go outside the cave and &quot;stand before the Lord</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; A terrible wind passes, but God is not in the wind</span>
				<span class='text'>A great earthquake shakes the mountain, but God is not in the earthquake</span>
				<span class='text'>Then a fire passes the mountain, but God is not in the fire</span>
				<span class='text'>Then a &quot;still small voice&quot; comes to Elijah and asks again, &quot;What doest thou here, Elijah?&quot; Elijah again evades the question and his lament is unrevised, showing that he did not understand the importance of the divine revelation he had just witnessed</span>
				<span class='text'>God then sends him out again, this time to [[Damascus]] to anoint [[Hazael]] as king of [[Syria]], [[Jehu]] as king of [[Israel]], and [[Elisha]] as his replacement</span>

				<span class='text'>]==== Vineyard of Naboth ====Elijah encounters Ahab again in {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|21|HE}}, after Ahab has acquired possession of a vineyard by murder</span>
				<span class='text'>Ahab desires to have the vineyard of [[Naboth]] of [[Jezreel (city)|Jezreel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He offers a better vineyard or a fair price for the land</span>
				<span class='text'>But Naboth tells Ahab that God has told him not to part with the land</span>
				<span class='text'>Ahab accepts this answer with sullen bad grace</span>
				<span class='text'>Jezebel, however, plots a method for acquiring the land</span>
				<span class='text'>She sends letters, in Ahab's name, to the elders and nobles who lived near Naboth</span>
				<span class='text'>They are to arrange a feast and invite Naboth</span>
				<span class='text'>At the feast, false charges of cursing God and Ahab are to be made against him</span>
				<span class='text'>The plot is carried out and Naboth is stoned to death</span>
				<span class='text'>When word comes that Naboth is dead, Jezebel tells Ahab to take possession of the vineyard</span>
				<span class='text'>od again speaks to Elijah and sends him to confront Ahab with a question and a prophecy: &quot;Have you killed and also taken possession?&quot; and, &quot;In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick up your own blood&quot; ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|21:19|HE}})</span>
				<span class='text'>Ahab begins the confrontation by calling Elijah his enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>Elijah responds by throwing the charge back at him, telling him that he has made himself the enemy of God by his own actions</span>
				<span class='text'>Elijah then goes beyond the prophecy he was given and tells Ahab that his entire kingdom will reject his authority; that Jezebel will be eaten by dogs within Jezreel; and that his family will be consumed by dogs as well (if they die in a city) or by birds (if they die in the country)</span>
				<span class='text'>When Ahab hears this he repents to such a degree that God relents in punishing Ahab but will punish Jezebel and their son‚Äî[[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]]</span>

				<span class='text'>]Elijah continues now from Ahab to an encounter with [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The scene opens with Ahaziah seriously injured in a fall</span>
				<span class='text'>He sends to the priests of [[Beelzebub|Baalzebub]] in [[Ekron]], outside the kingdom of Israel, to know if he will recover</span>
				<span class='text'>Elijah intercepts his messengers and sends them back to Ahaziah with a message</span>
				<span class='text'>In typical Elijah fashion, the message begins with a blunt, impertinent question: &quot;Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baalzebub, the god of Ekron?&quot;({{Bibleverse|2|Kings|1:6|HE}})</span>
				<span class='text'>Ahaziah asks the messengers to describe the person who gave them this message</span>
				<span class='text'>They tell him he wore a hairy coat with a leather belt and he instantly recognizes the description as Elijah the Tishbite</span>
				<span class='text'>haziah sends out three groups of soldiers to arrest Elijah</span>
				<span class='text'>The first two are destroyed by fire which Elijah calls down from heaven</span>
				<span class='text'>The leader of the third group asks for mercy for himself and his men</span>
				<span class='text'>Elijah agrees to accompany this third group to Ahaziah, where he gives his prophecy in person</span>
				<span class='text'>=== Departure ====Elijah, in company with [[Elisha]] (Eliseus), approaches the Jordan</span>
				<span class='text'>He rolls up his [[mantle (vesture)|mantle]] and strikes the water ({{Bibleverse|2|Kings|2:8|HE}})</span>
				<span class='text'>The water immediately divides and Elijah and Elisha cross on dry land</span>

				<span class='text'>A letter is sent under the prophet's name to [[Jehoram of Judah]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It tells him that he has led the people of Judah astray in the same way that Israel was led astray</span>
				<span class='text'>The prophet ends the letter with a prediction of a painful death</span>
				<span class='text'>This letter is a puzzle to readers for several reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>First, it concerns a king of the southern kingdom, while Elijah concerned himself with the kingdom of Israel</span>
				<span class='text'>Second, the message begins with &quot;Thus says [[YHVH]], God of your father David</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; rather than the more usual &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>n the name of [[YHVH]] the God of Israel</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Also, this letter seems to come after Elijah's ascension into the whirlwind</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Michael Wilcock]] suggests a number of possible reasons for this letter, among them that it may be an example of a better known prophet's name being substituted for that of a lesser known prophet</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; That day is described as the burning of a great furnace, &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>so that it will leave them neither root nor branch</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; ({{Bibleverse||Malachi|3:19|HE}}) In Christianity it is traditionally believed that Elijah's appearance during the [[transfiguration of Jesus]] fulfilled this prophecy</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, in the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus identifies John the Baptist as the spiritual successor to Elijah: &quot;and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|11:14|ESV}}) Finally, the verses in Malachi are believed to indicate that Elijah has a role in the end-times, immediately before the second coming of Jesus</span>
				<span class='text'>== Textual analysis ===According to Susanne Otto, the Elijah stories were added to the [[Deuteronomistic History]] in four stages</span>
				<span class='text'>The first stage dates from the final edition of the History, about 560 BC, when the three stories of [[Naboth]]‚Äôs vineyard, the death of [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]], and the story of [[Jehu]]‚Äôs coup were included to embody the themes of the reliability of God's word and the cycle of Baal worship and religious reform in the history of the Northern Kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'>The narratives about the [[Omri (King of Israel)|Omri]]de wars were added shortly afterwards to illustrate a newly introduced theme, that the attitude of the king towards the word of the prophets determines the fate of Israel</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Bibleverse|1|Kings|17‚Äì18|HE}} was added in early post-Exilic times (after 538 BC) to demonstrate the possibility of a new life in community with God after the time of judgment</span>
				<span class='text'>In the fifth century BC, {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:1‚Äì18|HE}} and the remaining [[Elisha]] stories were inserted to give prophecy a legitimate foundation in the history of Israel</span>

				<span class='text'>This varied literature does not merely discuss his life, but has created a new history of him, which, beginning with his death{{snd}} or &quot;translation&quot;{{snd}} ends only with the close of the history of the human race</span>
				<span class='text'>The volume of references to Elijah in Jewish Tradition stands in marked contrast to that in the Canon</span>
				<span class='text'>As in the case of most figures of Jewish legend, so in the case of Elijah, the biblical account became the basis of later legend</span>
				<span class='text'>Elijah the precursor of the Messiah, Elijah zealous in the cause of God, Elijah the helper in distress: these are the three leading notes struck by the Aggadah, endeavoring to complete the biblical picture with the Elijah legends</span>
				<span class='text'>His career is extensive, colorful, and varied</span>
				<span class='text'>He has appeared the world over in the guise of a beggar and scholar</span>
				<span class='text'>rom the time of [[Malachi]], who says of Elijah that God will send him before &quot;the great and dreadful day&quot; (Mal</span>
				<span class='text'>3:23), down to the later stories of the Chasidic rabbis, reverence and love, expectation and hope, were always connected in the Jewish consciousness with Elijah</span>
				<span class='text'>== Origin ===Three different theories regarding Elijah's origin are presented in the Aggadah literature:(1) he belonged to the tribe of Gad (Midrash Genensis Rabbah lxxi</span>
				<span class='text'>(2) he was a Benjamite from Jerusalem, identical with the Elijah mentioned in I Chron</span>
				<span class='text'>viii:27(3) he was a priest</span>
				<span class='text'>any Christian Church fathers also (Aphraates, &quot;Homilies,&quot; ed</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;314; Epiphanius, &quot;H√¶res</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|The statue of Elijah at the [[Saint Elias Cathedral]], [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]]]]In spite of Elijah's many miracles, the mass of the Jewish people remained as godless as before</span>
				<span class='text'>A [[midrash]] tells that they even abolished the sign of the covenant, and the prophet had to appear as Israel's accuser before God (Pir·∏≥e R</span>

				<span class='text'>xxix</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>n the same cave where God once appeared to Moses and revealed Himself as gracious and merciful, Elijah was summoned to appear before God</span>
				<span class='text'>By this summons he perceived that he should have appealed to God's mercy, instead of becoming Israel's accuser</span>
				<span class='text'>The prophet, however, remained relentless in his zeal and severity, so that God commanded him to appoint his successor (Tanna debe Eliyahu Zu·π≠a viii</span>

				<span class='text'> Elijah was &quot;translated</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Concerning the place to which Elijah was transferred, opinions differ among Jews and Christians, but the old view was that Elijah was received among the heavenly inhabitants, where he records the deeds of men (·∏≤id</span>

				<span class='text'>ut as early as the middle of the 2nd century, when the notion of translation to heaven was very much changed by Christian theologians, the assertion was made that Elijah never entered into heaven proper (Suk</span>

				<span class='text'>In later literature paradise is generally designated as the abode of Elijah (compare Pir·∏≥e R</span>

				<span class='text'>PG|thumb|&quot;Chair of Elijah&quot; used during the [[brit milah]] (circumcision) ceremony</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] inscription reads &quot;This is the chair of Elijah, remembered for Good</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;]]At Jewish [[Brit milah|circumcision]] ceremonies, a chair is set aside for the use of the prophet Elijah</span>
				<span class='text'>Elijah is said to be a [[witness]] at all circumcisions when the sign of the [[covenant (religion)|covenant]] is placed upon the body of the child</span>
				<span class='text'>This custom stems from the incident at [[Mount Horeb]] ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19|HE}}): Elijah had arrived at Mount Horeb after the demonstration of God's presence and power on [[Mount Carmel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18|HE}}) God asks Elijah to explain his arrival, and Elijah replies: ‚ÄúI have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts; for the people of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away‚Äù ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:10|HE}})</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Rabbinic tradition, Elijah's words were patently untrue ({{Bibleverse|1|Kings|18:4|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|1|Kings|19:18|HE}}), and since Elijah accused Israel of failing to uphold the covenant, God would require Elijah to be present at every covenant of circumcision</span>

				<span class='text'>Malachi had cited Elijah as the harbinger of the [[Jewish Eschatology|eschaton]]</span>

				<span class='text'>' Jerusalem: Keter Publishing House, 1971</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;One such decision was whether the [[Passover seder]] required four or five cups of wine</span>
				<span class='text'>Each serving of wine corresponds to one of the &quot;four expressions of redemption&quot; in the [[Book of Exodus]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I am the Lord, and ''I will bring you out'' from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and ''I will deliver you'' from their bondage, and ''I will redeem you'' with an out-stretched arm and with great acts of judgment, and ''I will take you'' for my people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians&quot; ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:6‚Äì7|HE}})</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;The next verse, &quot;And ''I will bring you'' into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; I will give it to you for a possession</span>
				<span class='text'>I am the Lord</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:8|HE}}) was not fulfilled until the generation following the Passover story, and the rabbis could not decide whether this verse counted as part of the Passover celebration (thus deserving of another serving of wine)</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, a cup was left for the arrival of Elijah</span>
				<span class='text'>n practice the fifth cup has come to be seen as a celebration of future redemption</span>
				<span class='text'>Today, a place is reserved at the seder table and a cup of wine is placed there for Elijah</span>
				<span class='text'>During the seder, the door of the house is opened and Elijah is invited in</span>
				<span class='text'>Traditionally, the cup is viewed as Elijah‚Äôs and is used for no other purpose</span>

				<span class='text'>Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions about any of the prophet‚Äôs actions</span>

				<span class='text'>The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow</span>

				<span class='text'>As they were leaving, they passed the man‚Äôs wall and saw that it was crumbling</span>

				<span class='text'>They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions</span>

				<span class='text'>He predicted the day of judgment using imagery similar to that of Malachi</span>
				<span class='text'>He also preached that the Messiah was coming</span>
				<span class='text'>All of this was done in a style that immediately recalled the image of Elijah to his audience</span>
				<span class='text'>He wore a coat of camel's hair secured with a leather girdle ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|3:4|9}}, {{Bibleverse||Mark|1:6|9}})</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Luke|9:51‚Äì56|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Jesus rebukes a potential follower who wanted first to return home to say farewell to his family, whereas Elijah permitted this of his replacement Elisha</span>

				<span class='text'>The disciples who are with Him hear the voice of God announce that Jesus is &quot;My beloved Son</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The disciples also see Moses and Elijah appear and talk with Jesus</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter is so struck by the experience that he asks Jesus if they should build three &quot;tabernacles&quot;: one for Elijah, one for Jesus and one for Moses</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;!-- I know that there has been a tabernacle built, I just need to find a source</span>
				<span class='text'>--&gt;There is agreement among some Christian theologians that Elijah appears to hand over the responsibility of the prophets to Jesus as the woman by the well said to Jesus (John 4:19) &quot;I perceive thou art a prophet</span>

				<span class='text'>The two words have very similar pronunciations in post-classical Greek; Elijah rode in his chariot of fire to heaven ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|2:11|9}}) just as Helios drove the chariot of the sun across the sky; and the [[Holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust sacrifice]] offered by Elijah and burned by fire from heaven ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|18:38|9}}) corresponds to the sun warming the earth</span>

				<span class='text'>174&lt;/ref&gt; the usual explanation for this has been that Elias was identified with Helios, who had mountaintop shrines</span>
				<span class='text'>But few shrines of Helios were on mountaintops, and sun-worship was subsumed by Apollo-worship by Christian times, and so could not be confused with Elias</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Delehaye, p</span>

				<span class='text'>174&lt;/ref&gt;The association of Elias with mountaintops seems to come from a different pagan tradition: Elias took on the attributes and the locales associated with [[Zeus]], especially his associations with mountains and his powers over rain, thunder, lighting, and wind</span>

				<span class='text'>That worship also included the worship of nature-powers and procreative powers, as in the Hindu worship of the Lingam, and led to many abuses</span>

				<span class='text'>The [[Qur'an]] states:{{Quote|Verily Elijah was one of the apostles</span>
				<span class='text'>When he said to his people: &quot;Will you not fear [[Allah|God]]? &quot;Will ye call upon Ba'al and leave the Best of Creators, God, your {{LORD}} and Cherisher and the {{LORD}} and Cherisher of your fathers of old?&quot;|Qur'an, chapter 37 ([[As-Saaffat]]), [[ayah|verse]] 123‚Äì126&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|37|123|e=126|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}The [[Qur'an]] makes it clear that the majority of Elijah's people denied the prophet and continued to follow idolatry</span>

				<span class='text'>The Qur'an states:{{Quote|They denied him (Elijah), and will surely be brought to punishment, Except the sincere and devoted Servants of God (among them)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation, Commentary'', ''Note on Elijah''&lt;/ref&gt; Elijah is believed to have preached with zeal to Ahab and his wife [[Jezebel]], who according to Muslim tradition was partly responsible for the worship of [[False god|false idols]] in this area</span>
				<span class='text'>Muslims believe that it was because the majority of people refused to listen to Elijah that Elisha had to continue preaching the message of [[God]] to Israel after him</span>

				<span class='text'>The Holy Bible </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>with a Commentary and Critical Notes, Volume II, London 1836&lt;/ref&gt; Objections to the traditional translation are that ravens are ritually unclean (see {{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11:13‚Äì17|HE}}) as well as physically dirty; it is difficult to imagine any method of delivery of the food which is not disgusting</span>
				<span class='text'>The parallelism with the incident that follows, where Elijah is fed by the widow, also suggests a human, if mildly improbable, agent</span>
				<span class='text'>rof</span>
				<span class='text'>John Gray chooses ''Arabs'', saying &quot;We adopt this reading solely because of its congruity with the sequel, where Elijah is fed by an alien Phoenician woman</span>

				<span class='text'>Old Testament Library, I &amp; II Kings, SCM Press, London, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; His translation of the verses in question is: &lt;blockquote&gt;And the word of Jehovah came to Elijah saying, Go hence and turn eastward and hide thyself in the Wadi Chorath east of the Jordan, and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the wadi, and I have commanded the Arabs to feed thee there</span>
