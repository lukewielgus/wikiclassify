				<span class='text'>Later that year he entered Thomas Morley's Commercial Academy, a [[private school]] founded in 1849 following the bankruptcy of Morley's earlier school</span>
				<span class='text'>The teaching was erratic, the curriculum mostly focused, Wells later said, on producing [[Copperplate script|copperplate handwriting]] and doing the sort of sums useful to tradesmen</span>

				<span class='text'>When his mother returned to work as a lady's maid (at [[Uppark]], a [[English country house|country house]] in [[Sussex]]), one of the conditions of work was that she would not be permitted to have living space for her husband and children</span>
				<span class='text'>Thereafter, she and Joseph lived separate lives, though they never divorced and remained faithful to each other</span>
				<span class='text'>As a consequence, Herbert's personal troubles increased as he subsequently failed as a draper and also, later, as a chemist's assistant</span>
				<span class='text'>Fortunately for Herbert, Uppark had a magnificent library in which he immersed himself, reading many classic works, including [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', and [[Thomas More|More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>After a short apprenticeship at a chemist in nearby [[Midhurst]], and an even shorter stay as a boarder at [[Midhurst Grammar School]], he signed his apprenticeship papers at Hyde's</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1883 Wells persuaded his parents to release him from the apprenticeship, taking an opportunity offered by Midhurst Grammar School again to become a pupil–teacher; his proficiency in Latin and science during his previous, short stay had been remembered</span>

				<span class='text'>These years mark the beginning of his interest in a possible reformation of society</span>
				<span class='text'>At first approaching the subject through Plato's ''Republic'', he soon turned to contemporary ideas of socialism as expressed by the recently formed [[Fabian Society]] and free lectures delivered at [[Kelmscott House]], the home of [[William Morris]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also among the founders of ''The Science School Journal'', a school magazine that allowed him to express his views on literature and society, as well as trying his hand at fiction; a precursor to his novel ''[[The Time Machine]]'' was published in the journal under the title ''[[The Chronic Argonauts]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The school year 1886–87 was the last year of his studies</span>
				<span class='text'>uring 1888 Wells stayed in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], living in [[Basford, Staffordshire|Basford]], and also at the Leopard Hotel in [[Burslem]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The unique environment of [[The Potteries]] was certainly an inspiration</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote in a letter to a friend from the area that &quot;the district made an immense impression on me</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The inspiration for some of his descriptions in ''The War of the Worlds'' is thought to have come from his short time spent here, seeing the iron foundry furnaces burn over the city, shooting huge red light into the skies</span>
				<span class='text'>His stay in The Potteries also resulted in the macabre short story &quot;[[The Cone]]&quot; (1895, contemporaneous with his famous ''The Time Machine''), set in the north of the city</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;Wells in the centre of the town of [[Woking]], England]]Some of his early novels, called &quot;[[scientific romance]]s&quot;, invented several themes now classic in science fiction in such works as ''[[The Time Machine]]'', ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'', ''[[The Invisible Man]]'', ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', ''[[The Sleeper Awakes|When the Sleeper Wakes]]'', and ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He also wrote realistic novels that received critical acclaim, including ''[[Kipps]]'' and a satire on Edwardian advertising, ''[[Tono-Bungay]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Wells also wrote dozens of short stories and novellas, the best known of which is &quot;[[The Country of the Blind]]&quot; (1904)</span>
				<span class='text'>hough ''Tono-Bungay'' is not a science-fiction novel, radioactive decay plays a small but consequential role in it</span>
				<span class='text'>Radioactive decay plays a much larger role in ''[[The World Set Free]]'' (1914)</span>
				<span class='text'>This book contains what is surely his biggest prophetic &quot;hit&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Scientists of the day were well aware that the natural decay of [[radium]] releases energy at a slow rate over thousands of years</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''rate'' of release is too slow to have practical utility, but the ''total amount'' released is huge</span>
				<span class='text'>Wells's novel revolves around an (unspecified) invention that accelerates the process of radioactive decay, producing bombs that explode with no more than the force of ordinary high explosives—but which &quot;continue to explode&quot; for days on end</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Nothing could have been more obvious to the people of the earlier twentieth century&quot;, he wrote, &quot;than the rapidity with which war was becoming impossible&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[but] they did not see it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1932, the physicist and conceiver of [[nuclear chain reaction]] [[Leó Szilárd]] read ''The World Set Free'', a book which he said made a great impression on him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Richard Rhodes]] | year = 1986 | title = The Making of the Atomic Bomb | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York | page = 24 | isbn = 0-684-81378-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;Wells also wrote nonfiction</span>
				<span class='text'>Wells's first nonfiction [[bestseller]] was ''[[Anticipations|Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress upon Human Life and Thought]]'' (1901)</span>
				<span class='text'>When originally serialized in a magazine it was subtitled, &quot;An Experiment in Prophecy&quot;, and is considered his most explicitly [[future|futuristic]] work</span>
				<span class='text'>It offered the immediate political message of the privileged sections of society continuing to bar capable men from other classes from advancement until war would force a need to employ those most able, rather than the traditional upper classes, as leaders</span>
				<span class='text'>Anticipating what the world would be like in the year 2000, the book is interesting both for its hits (trains and cars resulting in the dispersion of populations from cities to suburbs; moral restrictions declining as men and women seek greater sexual freedom; the defeat of German [[militarism]], and the existence of a European Union) and its misses (he did not expect successful [[aircraft]] before 1950, and averred that &quot;my imagination refuses to see any sort of submarine doing anything but suffocate its crew and founder at sea&quot;)</span>

				<span class='text'>The &quot;Outlines&quot; became sufficiently common for [[James Thurber]] to parody the trend in his humorous essay, &quot;An Outline of Scientists&quot;—indeed, Wells's ''Outline of History'' remains in print with a new 2005 edition, while ''A Short History of the World'' has been  re-edited (2006)</span>
				<span class='text'>rom quite early in his career, he sought a better way to organize society, and wrote a number of [[Utopia]]n novels</span>
				<span class='text'>The first of these was ''[[A Modern Utopia]]'' (1905), which shows a worldwide utopia with &quot;no imports but meteorites, and no exports at all&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;''A Modern Utopia''&lt;/ref&gt; two travellers from our world fall into its [[alternate history]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The others usually begin with the world rushing to catastrophe, until people realize a better way of living: whether by mysterious gases from a [[comet]] causing people to behave rationally and abandoning a European war (''[[In the Days of the Comet]]'' (1906)), or a world council of scientists taking over, as in ''[[The Shape of Things to Come]]'' (1933, which he later adapted for the 1936 [[Alexander Korda]] film, ''[[Things to Come]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>This depicted, all too accurately, the impending [[World War II|World War]], with cities being destroyed by aerial bombs</span>
				<span class='text'>He also portrayed the rise of [[fascism|fascist]] dictators in ''The Autocracy of Mr Parham'' (1930) and ''The Holy Terror'' (1939)</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Men Like Gods]]'' (1923) is also a utopian novel</span>
				<span class='text'>Wells in this period was regarded as an enormously influential figure; the critic [[Malcolm Cowley]] stated &quot;by the time he was forty, his influence was wider than any other living English writer&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Wells circa 1918]]Wells contemplates the ideas of [[nature and nurture]] and questions humanity in books such as ''The Island of Doctor Moreau''</span>
				<span class='text'>Not all his scientific romances ended in a Utopia, and Wells also wrote a [[dystopia]]n novel, ''When the Sleeper Wakes'' (1899, rewritten as ''The Sleeper Awakes'', 1910), which pictures a future society where the classes have become more and more separated, leading to a revolt of the masses against the rulers</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Island of Doctor Moreau'' is even darker</span>
				<span class='text'>The narrator, having been trapped on an island of animals vivisected (unsuccessfully) into human beings, eventually returns to England; like [[Gulliver's Travels|Gulliver]] on his return from the [[Houyhnhnm]]s, he finds himself unable to shake off the perceptions of his fellow humans as barely civilised beasts, slowly reverting to their animal natures</span>

				<span class='text'>Since &quot;Barbellion&quot; was the real author's [[pen name]], many reviewers believed Wells to have been the true author of the ''Journal''; Wells always denied this, despite being full of praise for the diaries, but the rumours persisted until Barbellion's death later that year</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1927 a Canadian citizen, [[Florence Deeks]] (1864–1959), unsuccessfully sued Wells for infringement of copyright and breach of trust, claiming that much of ''The Outline of History'' had been plagiarized from her unpublished manuscript,&lt;ref&gt;At the time of the alleged infringement in 1919-20, unpublished works were protected in Canada under common law</span>

				<span class='text'>According to McKillop, the lawsuit was unsuccessful due to the prejudice against a woman suing a well-known and famous male author; McKillop paints a detailed story based on the circumstantial evidence of the case, and suggests that in a more modern court, she would have been successful</span>
				<span class='text'>eeks's manuscript was apparently sent to MacMillan and Company, UK, to check that references to other works did not violate copyright</span>
				<span class='text'>It appeared to go through the hands of one of the editors in the UK who passed it onto Wells, as he knew Wells was thinking of a similar project</span>
				<span class='text'>The net result was that Deeks's eventually rejected work came back and when it was eventually opened, it was found &quot;soiled, thumbed, worn and torn, with over a dozen pages turned down at the corners, and many others creased as if having been bent back in use&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>==Class===Social class was a theme in Wells's ''[[The Time Machine]]'' in which the Time Traveller speaks of the future world, with its two races, as having evolved from:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;the gradual widening of the present (19th century) merely temporary and social difference between the Capitalist and the Labourer</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Even now, does not an East-end worker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of the earth? Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people&amp;nbsp;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Wells has this very same Time Traveller, reflecting his own socialist leanings, refer in a tongue-in-cheek manner to an imagined world of stark class division as &quot;perfect&quot; and with no social problem unsolved</span>
				<span class='text'>His Time Traveller thus highlights how strict class division leads to the eventual downfall of the human race: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Once, life and property must have reached almost absolute safety</span>
				<span class='text'>The rich had been assured of his wealth and comfort, the toiler assured of his life and work</span>
				<span class='text'>No doubt in that perfect world there had been no unemployed problem, no social question left unsolved</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his book ''[[The Way the World is Going]]'', Wells called for a non-Marxist form of [[socialism]] to be set up, that would avoid both [[Class conflict|class war]] and conflict between nations</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===World government===His most consistent political ideal was the [[World government|World State]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He stated in his autobiography that from 1900 onward he considered a World State inevitable</span>
				<span class='text'>He envisioned the state to be a planned society that would advance science, end nationalism, and allow people to progress by merit rather than birth</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[Anticipations]]'' (1900) Wells envisaged that &quot;the great urban region between Chicago and the Atlantic” will unify the English-speaking states, and this larger English-speaking unit, “a New Republic dominating the world,” will by the year 2000 become the means “by which the final peace of the world may be assured forever</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; It will be “a new social Hercules that will strangle the serpents of war and national animosity in his cradle</span>
				<span class='text'> Such a synthesis &quot;of the peoples now using the English tongue, I regard not only as possible, but as a probable, thing</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anticipations]]'', pp 100-101</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The New Republic “will already be consciously and pretty freely controlling the general affairs of humanity before this century closes…” Its principles and opinions “must necessarily shape and determine that still ampler future of which the coming hundred years is but the opening phase</span>
				<span class='text'> The New Republic must ultimately become a &quot;World-State</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Anticipations]]'', p 107</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Wells's 1928 book ''[[The Open Conspiracy]]'' argued that groups of campaigners should begin advocating for a &quot;world commonwealth&quot;, governed by a scientific elite, that would work to eliminate problems such as poverty and warfare</span>

				<span class='text'>68–74</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Wells's article was a strong attack on anti-black discrimination in South Africa</span>
				<span class='text'>Wells claimed he had &quot;the utmost contempt and indignation for the unfairness of the handicaps put upon men of colour&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Summary===In the end Wells's contemporary political impact was limited, excluding his fiction's positivist stance on the leaps that could be made by [[physics]] towards world peace</span>
				<span class='text'>His efforts regarding the [[League of Nations]] became a disappointment as the organization turned out to be a weak one unable to prevent the Second World War, which itself occurred towards the very end of his life and only increased the pessimistic side of his nature</span>
				<span class='text'>In his last book ''[[Mind at the End of Its Tether]]'' (1945) he considered the idea that humanity being replaced by another species might not be a bad idea</span>
				<span class='text'>He also came to refer to the Second World War era as &quot;The Age of Frustration&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>=Religious views==Wells wrote in his book ''God the Invisible King'' (1917) that his idea of God did not draw upon the traditional religions of the world: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;This book sets out as forcibly and exactly as possible the religious belief of the writer</span>
				<span class='text'>[Which] is a profound belief in a personal and intimate God</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Putting the leading idea of this book very roughly, these two antagonistic typical conceptions of God may be best contrasted by speaking of one of them as God-as-Nature or the Creator, and of the other as God-as-Christ or the Redeemer</span>
				<span class='text'>One is the great Outward God; the other is the Inmost God</span>
				<span class='text'>The first idea was perhaps developed most highly and completely in the God of Spinoza</span>
				<span class='text'>It is a conception of God tending to pantheism, to an idea of a comprehensive God as ruling with justice rather than affection, to a conception of aloofness and awestriking worshipfulness</span>
				<span class='text'>The second idea, which is opposed to this idea of an absolute God, is the God of the human heart</span>
				<span class='text'>The writer would suggest that the great outline of the theological struggles of that phase of civilisation and world unity which produced Christianity, was a persistent but unsuccessful attempt to get these two different ideas of God into one focus</span>
