				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In Antioch, over the course of twelve years (386‚Äì397), John gained popularity because of the eloquence of his public speaking at the Golden Church, Antioch's cathedral, especially his insightful expositions of Bible passages and moral teaching</span>
				<span class='text'>The most valuable of his works from this period are his ''[[Homilies]]'' on various books of the Bible</span>
				<span class='text'>He emphasised charitable giving and was concerned with the spiritual and temporal needs of the poor</span>
				<span class='text'>He spoke against abuse of wealth and personal property:&lt;blockquote&gt;Do you wish to honour the body of Christ? Do not ignore him when he is naked</span>

				<span class='text'>When Chrysostom arrived in Antioch, Flavian, the bishop of the city had to intervene with Emperor [[Theodosius I]] on behalf of citizens who had gone on a rampage mutilating statues of the Emperor and his family</span>
				<span class='text'>During the weeks of [[Lent]] in 387, John preached more than twenty homilies in which he entreated the people to see the error of their ways</span>
				<span class='text'>These made a lasting impression on the general population of the city: many pagans converted to Christianity as a result of the homilies</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, Theodosius' vengeance was not as severe as it might have been</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> somewhat more literal in interpreting Biblical events), but he also uses a good deal of the allegorical interpretation more associated with the [[Alexandrian school]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;online&quot;/&gt;John's social and religious world was formed by the continuing and pervasive presence of paganism in the life of the city</span>

				<span class='text'>176)&lt;/ref&gt;}}====Homilies on Jews and Judaizing Christians===={{main|Adversus Judaeos}}During his first two years as a presbyter in Antioch (386‚Äì387), John denounced [[Jew]]s and [[Judaizers|Judaizing Christians]] in a series of eight homilies delivered to Christians in his congregation who were taking part in [[Jewish festivals]] and other Jewish observances</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See Wilken, p</span>
				<span class='text'>xv, and also &quot;John Chrysostom&quot; in ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''&lt;/ref&gt; It is disputed whether the main target were specifically Judaizers or Jews in general</span>
				<span class='text'>His homilies were expressed in the conventional manner, utilizing the uncompromising [[rhetoric]]al form known as the ''psogos'' (Greek: blame, censure)</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=June 2015}}One of the purposes of these homilies was to prevent Christians from participating in Jewish customs, and thus prevent the perceived erosion of Chrysostom's flock</span>
				<span class='text'>In his homilies, John criticized those &quot;Judaizing Christians&quot;, who were participating in Jewish festivals and taking part in other Jewish observances, such as the [[shabbat]], submitted to [[Circumcision in the Bible|circumcision]] and made pilgrimage to Jewish holy places</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wilken, p</span>
				<span class='text'>xv</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;John claimed that on the shabbats and Jewish festivals [[synagogue]]s were full of Christians, especially women, who loved the solemnity of the Jewish liturgy, enjoyed listening to the [[shofar]] on [[Rosh Hashanah]], and applauded famous preachers in accordance with the contemporary custom</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''On the Priesthood'' was well-known already during Chrysostom's lifetime, and is cited by Jerome in 392 in his ''[[De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)|De Viris Illustribus]]'', chapter 129&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he wrote a series of letters to the [[deaconess]] [[St</span>

				<span class='text'>He harmonized the liturgical life of the Church by revising the prayers and rubrics of the [[Divine Liturgy]], or celebration of the Holy Eucharist</span>

				<span class='text'>The saint can be seen in the background on all fours, whilst the princess and their baby dominate the foreground</span>
				<span class='text'>]A late medieval legend (not included in the [[Golden Legend]]) relates that, when John Chrysostom was a [[hermit]] in the desert, he was approached by a royal princess in distress</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;A variant relates that this was [[Genevieve of Brabant]], wife of Count Siegfried of [[Treves]], who was unjustly accused of infidelity and sentenced to death</span>
				<span class='text'>She was led into the forest to be put to death, but her executioners relented and there abandoned her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Saint, thinking she was a demon, at first refused to help her, but the princess convinced him that she was a Christian and would be devoured by wild beasts if she were not allowed to enter his cave</span>
				<span class='text'>He therefore admitted her, carefully dividing the cave in two parts, one for each of them</span>
				<span class='text'>In spite of these precautions, the sin of [[fornication]] was committed, and in an attempt to hide it, the distraught saint took the princess and threw her over a precipice</span>
				<span class='text'>He then went to Rome to beg absolution, which was refused</span>
				<span class='text'>Realising the appalling nature of his crimes, Chrysostom made a vow that he would never rise from the ground until his sins were expiated, and for years he lived like a beast, crawling on all fours and feeding on wild grasses and roots</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequently the princess reappeared, alive, and suckling the saint's baby, who miraculously pronounced his sins forgiven</span>
				<span class='text'>This last scene was very popular from the late 15th century onwards as a subject for engravers and artists</span>
				<span class='text'>The theme was depicted by [[Albrecht D√ºrer]] around 1496,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The skull, however, having been kept at the monastery at [[Vatopedi]]  on [[Mount Athos]] in northern Greece, was not among the relics that were taken by the crusaders in the 13th century</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1655, at the request of [[Alexis of Russia|Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich]], the skull was taken to Russia, for which the monastery was compensated in the sum of 2000 rubles</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1693, having received a request from the Vatopedi Monastery for the return of St John's skull, [[Peter I of Russia|Tsar Peter the Great]] ordered that the skull remain in Russia but that the monastery was to be paid 500 rubles every four years</span>
				<span class='text'>The Russian state archives document these payments up until 1735</span>
				<span class='text'>The skull was kept at the [[Moscow Kremlin]], in the [[Cathedral of the Dormition|Cathedral of the Dormition of the Mother of God]], until 1920, when it was confiscated by the [[Soviets]] and placed in the Museum of Silver Antiquities</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1988, in connection with the 1000th Anniversary of the [[Baptism of Russia]], the head, along with other important relics, was returned to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and kept at the [[Epiphany Cathedral at Yelokhovo|Epiphany Cathedral]], until being moved to the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] after its restoration</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=June 2015}}Today, the monastery at Vatopedi posits a rival claim to possessing the skull of John Chrysostom, and there a skull is venerated by pilgrims to the monastery as that of St John</span>
				<span class='text'>Two sites in Italy also claim to have the saint's skull: the [[Florence Cathedral|Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore]] in Florence and the ''[[Camposanto Monumentale|Dal Pozzo]]'' chapel in Pisa</span>
