				<span class='text'>While teaching and lecturing in this part of his country (the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] region), Bergson found time for private study and original work</span>
				<span class='text'>He crafted his dissertation ''Time and Free Will'', which was submitted, along with a short [[Latin]] thesis on [[Aristotle]] (''Quid Aristoteles de loco senserit''), for his doctoral degree which was awarded by the [[University of Paris]] in 1889</span>
				<span class='text'>The work was published in the same year by [[Félix Alcan]]</span>

				<span class='text'>There, he read [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and gave a course on his theories</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt;  Although Bergson had previously endorsed [[Lamarckism]] and its theory of the [[inheritance of acquired characters|heritability of acquired characteristics]], he came to prefer Darwin's hypothesis of gradual variations, which were more compatible with his continuist vision of life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt;In 1896 he published his second major work, entitled ''Matter and Memory''</span>
				<span class='text'>This rather difficult work investigates the function of the brain and undertakes an analysis of [[perception]] and [[memory]], leading up to a careful consideration of the problems of the relation of body and mind</span>
				<span class='text'>Bergson had spent years of research in preparation for each of his three large works</span>
				<span class='text'>This is especially obvious in ''Matter and Memory'', where he showed a thorough acquaintance with the extensive pathological investigations which had been carried out during the period</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1898 Bergson became ''[[Maître de conférences]]'' at his [[alma mater]], ''l'Ecole Normale Supérieure'', and later in the same year received promotion to a Professorship</span>

				<span class='text'>t the first [[International Congress of Philosophy]], held in Paris during the first five days of August, 1900, Bergson read a short, but important, paper, &quot;Psychological Origins of the Belief in the Law of Causality&quot; (''Sur les origines psychologiques de notre croyance à la loi de causalité'')</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1900 [[Felix Alcan]] published a work which had previously appeared in the ''[[Revue de Paris]]'', entitled ''[[Laughter (book)|Laughter]]'' (''Le rire''), one of the most important of Bergson's minor productions</span>
				<span class='text'>This essay on the meaning of comedy stemmed from a lecture which he had given in his early days in the Auvergne</span>
				<span class='text'>The study of it is essential to an understanding of Bergson's views of life, and its passages dealing with the place of the artistic in life are valuable</span>
				<span class='text'>The main thesis of the work is that [[laughter]] is a corrective evolved to make social life possible for human beings</span>
				<span class='text'>We laugh at people who fail to adapt to the demands of society, if it seems their failure is akin to an inflexible mechanism</span>
				<span class='text'>[[comedy|Comic]] authors have exploited this human tendency to laugh in various ways, and what is common to them is the idea that the comic consists in there being &quot;something mechanical encrusted on the living&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>The two became great friends</span>
				<span class='text'>James's impression of Bergson is given in his Letters under date of 4 October 1908:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;So modest and unpretending a man but such a genius intellectually! I have the strongest suspicions that the tendency which he has brought to a focus, will end by prevailing, and that the present epoch will be a sort of turning point in the history of philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As early as 1880, James had contributed an article in French to the periodical ''La Critique philosophique'', of Renouvier and Pillon, entitled ''[[Le Sentiment de l'Effort]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Four years later, a couple of articles by him appeared in the journal ''Mind'': &quot;What is an Emotion?&quot; and &quot;On some Omissions of Introspective Psychology&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Bergson quoted the first two of these articles in his 1889 work, ''Time and Free Will''</span>
				<span class='text'>In the following years 1890-91 appeared the two volumes of James's monumental work, ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'', in which he refers to a pathological phenomenon observed by Bergson</span>
				<span class='text'>Some writers, taking merely these dates into consideration and overlooking the fact that James's investigations had been proceeding since 1870 (registered from time to time by various articles which culminated in &quot;The Principles&quot;), have mistakenly dated Bergson's ideas as earlier than James's</span>
				<span class='text'>t has been suggested{{By whom|date=September 2009}} that Bergson owes the root ideas of his first book to the 1884 article by James, &quot;On Some Omissions of Introspective Psychology,&quot; which he neither refers to nor quotes</span>
				<span class='text'>This article deals with the conception of thought as a [[stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]], which [[intellect]] distorts by framing into concepts</span>
				<span class='text'>Bergson replied to this insinuation by denying that he had any knowledge of the article by James when he wrote ''Les données immédiates de la conscience''</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The two thinkers appear to have developed independently until almost the close of the century</span>
				<span class='text'>They are further apart in their intellectual position than is frequently supposed</span>
				<span class='text'>Both have succeeded in appealing to audiences far beyond the purely academic sphere, but only in their mutual rejection of &quot;intellectualism&quot; as final is there real unanimity</span>
				<span class='text'>Although James was slightly ahead in the development and enunciation of his ideas, he confessed that he was baffled by many of Bergson's notions</span>
				<span class='text'>James certainly neglected many of the deeper metaphysical aspects of Bergson's thought, which did not harmonize with his own, and are even in direct contradiction</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to this, Bergson can hardly be considered a pragmatist</span>
				<span class='text'>For him, &quot;utility,&quot; far from being a test of truth, was in fact the reverse: a synonym for error</span>
				<span class='text'>evertheless, William James hailed Bergson as an ally</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1903, he wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;I have been re-reading Bergson's books, and nothing that I have read since years has so excited and stimulated my thoughts</span>
				<span class='text'>I am sure that that philosophy has a great future, it breaks through old cadres and brings things into a solution from which new crystals can be got</span>

				<span class='text'>It had induced him, he continued, &quot;to give up logic, squarely and irrevocably&quot; as a method, for he found that &quot;reality, life, experience, concreteness, immediacy, use what word you will, exceeds our logic, overflows, and surrounds it&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>hese remarks, which appeared in James's book ''A Pluralistic Universe'' in 1909, impelled many English and American readers to an investigation of Bergson's philosophy for themselves, but no English translations of Bergson's  major work had yet appeared</span>
				<span class='text'>James, however, encouraged and assisted Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Arthur Mitchell (physician)|Arthur Mitchell]] in his preparation of the English translation of ''Creative Evolution''</span>
				<span class='text'>In August 1910, James died</span>
				<span class='text'>It was his intention, had he lived to see the completion of the translation, to introduce it to the English reading public by a prefatory note of appreciation</span>
				<span class='text'>In the following year the translation was completed and still greater interest in Bergson and his work was the result</span>
				<span class='text'>By coincidence, in that same year (1911), Bergson penned a preface of sixteen pages entitled ''Truth and Reality'' for the French translation of James's book, ''Pragmatism''</span>
				<span class='text'>In it he expressed sympathetic appreciation of James's work, coupled with certain important reservations</span>
				<span class='text'>rom April 5 to 11, Bergson attended the Fourth International Congress of Philosophy held at [[Bologna]], in Italy, where he gave an address on &quot;Philosophical Intuition&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>This subsequently appeared in ''[[The Hibbert Journal]]'' (October, 1911), and since revised, forms the first essay in the collected volume ''Mind-Energy'' (''L'Énergie spirituelle'')</span>
				<span class='text'>In October he again travelled to England, where he had an enthusiastic reception, and delivered at [[University College London]] four lectures on ''La Nature de l'Âme'' [The nature of the soul]</span>

				<span class='text'>In February, at Columbia University, he lectured both in French and English, taking as his subjects: ''Spirituality and Freedom'' and ''The Method of Philosophy''</span>
				<span class='text'>Being again in England in May of the same year, he accepted the Presidency of the [[British Society for Psychical Research]], and delivered to the Society an impressive address: ''Phantoms of Life and Psychic Research'' (Fantômes des vivants et recherche psychique)</span>

				<span class='text'>==Later years===In 1914 the Scottish universities arranged for Bergson to give the famous [[Gifford Lectures]], planning one course for the spring and another for the autumn</span>
				<span class='text'>Bergson delivered the first course, consisting of eleven lectures, under the title of ''The Problem of Personality'', at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in the spring of that year</span>
				<span class='text'>The course of lectures planned for the autumn months had to be abandoned because of the outbreak of war</span>
				<span class='text'>Bergson was not, however, silent during the conflict, and he gave some inspiring addresses</span>
				<span class='text'>As early as 4 November 1914, he wrote an article entitled ''Wearing and Nonwearing forces'' (La force qui s'use et celle qui ne s'use pas), which appeared in that unique and interesting periodical of the ''[[poilu]]s'', ''Le Bulletin des Armées de la République Française''</span>
				<span class='text'>A presidential address, ''The Meaning of the War'', was delivered in December, 1914, to the Académie des sciences morales et politiques</span>

				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, he found time to issue at the request of the Minister of Public Instruction a brief summary of French Philosophy</span>

				<span class='text'>He participated to the negotiations which led to the [[World War I#Entry of the United States|entry of the United States]] in the war</span>

				<span class='text'>Viviani's book ''La Mission française en Amérique'' (1917), contains a preface by Bergson</span>
				<span class='text'>arly in 1918 the ''[[Académie française]]'' received Bergson officially when he took his seat among &quot;The Select Forty&quot; as successor to [[Emile Ollivier]] (the author of the historical work ''L'Empire libéral'')</span>
				<span class='text'>A session was held in January in his honour at which he delivered an address on Ollivier</span>
				<span class='text'>In the war, Bergson saw the conflict of Mind and Matter, or rather of Life and Mechanism; and thus he shows us the central idea of his own philosophy in action</span>
				<span class='text'>To no other philosopher has it fallen, during his lifetime, to have his philosophical principles so vividly and so terribly tested</span>
				<span class='text'>s many of Bergson's contributions to French periodicals remained relatively inaccessible, he agreed to the request of his friends{{Which|date=November 2009}} to have such works collected and published in two volumes</span>
				<span class='text'>The first of these was being planned when war broke out</span>
				<span class='text'>The conclusion of strife was marked by the appearance of a delayed volume in 1919</span>
				<span class='text'>It bears the title ''Spiritual Energy: Essays and Lectures'' (reprinted as ''Mind-Energy'' – ''L'Énergie spirituelle: essais et conférences'')</span>
				<span class='text'>The advocate of Bergson's philosophy in England, Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Wildon Carr]], prepared an English translation under the title ''Mind-Energy''</span>
				<span class='text'>The volume opens with the Huxley Memorial Lecture of 1911, &quot;Life and Consciousness&quot;, in a revised and developed form under the title &quot;Consciousness and Life&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Signs of Bergson's growing interest in social ethics and in the idea of a future life of personal survival are manifested</span>
				<span class='text'>The lecture before the Society for Psychical Research is included, as is also the one given in France, ''L'Âme et le Corps'', which contains the substance of the four London lectures on the Soul</span>
				<span class='text'>The seventh and last article is a reprint of Bergson's famous lecture to the Congress of Philosophy at Geneva in 1904, ''The Psycho-Physiological Paralogism'' (Le paralogisme psycho-physiologique), which now appears as ''Le cerveau et la pensée: une illusion philosophique''</span>
				<span class='text'>Other articles are on the False Recognition, on Dreams, and Intellectual Effort</span>
				<span class='text'>The volume is a most welcome production and serves to bring together what Bergson wrote on the concept of mental force, and on his view of &quot;tension&quot; and &quot;detension&quot; as applied to the relation of matter and mind</span>
				<span class='text'>n June 1920, the [[University of Cambridge]] honoured him with the degree of [[Doctor of Letters]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In order that he might devote his full-time to the great new work he was preparing on ethics, religion, and sociology, the Collège de France relieved Bergson of the duties attached to the Chair of Modern Philosophy there</span>
				<span class='text'>He retained the chair, but no longer delivered lectures, his place being taken by his disciple, the mathematician and philosopher [[Édouard Le Roy]], who supported a [[conventionalism|conventionalist]] stance on the [[foundations of mathematics]], which was adopted by Bergson</span>

				<span class='text'>Like Bergson's, his writings were placed on the Index by the Vatican</span>
				<span class='text'>==Debate with Albert Einstein===Bergson published ''Duration and Simultaneity: Bergson and the Einsteinian Universe'' (''Durée et simultanéité''), a book on [[physics]], which he followed with a polemical conversation with [[Albert Einstein]] at the French Society of Philosophy</span>

				<span class='text'>=Philosophy==Bergson rejected what he saw as the overly mechanistic predominant view of causality (as expressed in, say, [[finalism]])</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued that we must allow space for free will to unfold in an autonomous and unpredictable fashion</span>
				<span class='text'>While Kant saw free will as something beyond time and space and therefore ultimately a matter of faith, Bergson attempted to redefine the modern conceptions of time, space, and causality in his concept of [[Duration (philosophy)|Duration]], making room for a tangible marriage of free will with causality</span>
				<span class='text'>Seeing Duration as a mobile and fluid concept, Bergson argued that one cannot understand Duration through &quot;immobile&quot; analysis, but only through experiential, first-person [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuition]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Creativity===Bergson considers the appearance of novelty as a result of pure undetermined creation, instead of as the predetermined result of mechanistic forces</span>
				<span class='text'>His philosophy emphasises pure mobility, unforeseeable novelty, creativity and freedom; thus one can characterize his system as a [[process philosophy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It touches upon such topics as time and identity, [[free will]], perception, change, memory, consciousness, language, the [[foundation of mathematics]] and the limits of reason</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bergson explores these topics in ''Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness'', in ''Matter and Memory'', in ''Creative Evolution'', and in ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Criticizing [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s theory of knowledge exposed in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and his conception of truth — which he compares to [[Plato]]'s conception of truth as its symmetrical inversion (order of nature/order of thought) — Bergson attempted to redefine the relations between science and metaphysics, intelligence and [[intuition (Bergson)|intuition]], and insisted on the necessity of increasing thought's possibility through the use of intuition, which, according to him, alone approached a knowledge of the absolute and of real life, understood as pure [[Duration (philosophy)|duration]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of his (relative) criticism of intelligence, he makes a frequent use of images and metaphors in his writings in order to avoid the use of [[concept]]s, which (he considers) fail to touch the whole of reality, being only a sort of abstract net thrown on things</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance, he says in ''The Creative Evolution'' (chap</span>
				<span class='text'>II) that thought in itself would never have thought it possible for the human being to swim, as it cannot deduce swimming from walking</span>
				<span class='text'>For swimming to be possible, man must throw itself in water, and only then can thought consider swimming as possible</span>
				<span class='text'>Intelligence, for Bergson, is a practical faculty rather than a pure speculative faculty, a product of evolution used by man to survive</span>
				<span class='text'>If metaphysics is to avoid &quot;false problems&quot;, it should not extend to pure speculation the abstract concepts of intelligence, but rather use intuition</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt;  Indeed, he considers that finalism is unable to explain &quot;duration&quot; and the &quot;continuous creation of life&quot;, as it only explains life as the progressive development of an initially determined program — a notion which remains, for example, in the expression of a &quot;[[genetics|genetic]] program&quot;;&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt;  such a description of finalism was adopted, for instance, by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt; It clearly announces [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s</span>
				<span class='text'>ergson regarded planning beforehand for the future as impossible, since time itself unravels unforeseen possibilities</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, one could always explain a historical event retrospectively by its conditions of possibility</span>
				<span class='text'>But, in the introduction to the ''Pensée et le mouvant'', he explains that such an event created retrospectively its causes, taking the example of the creation of a work of art, for example a symphony: it was impossible to predict what would be the symphony of the future, as if the musician knew what symphony would be the best for his time, he would realize it</span>
				<span class='text'>In his words, the effect created its cause</span>
				<span class='text'>Henceforth, he attempted to find a third way between mechanism and finalism, through the notion of an original impulse, the ''élan vital'', in life, which dispersed itself through evolution into contradictory tendencies (he substituted to the finalist notion of a [[teleological]] aim a notion of an original impulse)</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Bergson argued, Duration is unextended yet heterogeneous, and so its parts cannot be juxtaposed as a succession of distinct parts, with one causing the other</span>
				<span class='text'>Based on this he concluded that determinism is an impossibility and free will pure mobility, which is what Bergson identified as being the Duration</span>

				<span class='text'>One may translate the line and pile commentary upon commentary, but this commentary too shall never grasp the simple dimensional value of experiencing the poem in its originality itself</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===''Élan vital''==={{See also|Élan vital}}Élan vital ranks as Bergson's third essential concept, after Duration and intuition</span>
				<span class='text'>An idea with the goal of explaining evolution, the Élan vital first appeared in 1907’s ''Creative Evolution''</span>
				<span class='text'>Bergson portrays Élan vital as a kind of vital impetus which explains evolution in a less mechanical and more lively manner, as well as accounting for the creative impulse of mankind</span>
				<span class='text'>This concept led several authors to characterize Bergson as a supporter of [[vitalism]]—although he criticized it explicitly in ''The Creative Evolution'', as he thought, against [[Hans Adolf Eduard Driesch|Driesch]] and [[Johannes Reinke]] (whom he cited) that there is neither &quot;purely internal finality nor clearly cut individuality in nature&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;''L'Évolution créatrice'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>42-44; pp</span>
				<span class='text'>226-227&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Hereby lies the stumbling block of vitalist theories (</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> It is thus in vain that one pretends to reduce finality to the individuality of the living being</span>
				<span class='text'>If there is finality in the world of life, it encompasses the whole of life in one indivisible embrace</span>

				<span class='text'>42-43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;===Laughter===In ''[[Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of the Comic]]'', Bergson develops a theory not of laughter itself but of how laughter can be provoked (see his objection to Delage, published in the 23rd edition of the essay)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt; He describes the process of laughter (refusing to give a conceptual definition which would not approach its reality&lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt;), used in particular by comics and [[clown]]s, as the caricature of the mechanism nature of humans (habits, automatic acts, etc</span>
				<span class='text'>, one of the two tendencies of life (degradation towards inert matter and mechanism, and continual creation of new forms)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt; However, Bergson warns us that laughter’s criterion of what should be laughed at is not a moral criterion and that it can in fact cause serious damage to a person’s [[self-esteem]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt;==Reception==From his first publications, Bergson's philosophy attracted strong criticism from different quarters, although he also became very popular and durably influenced [[French philosophy]]</span>
				<span class='text'> The mathematician [[Édouard Le Roy]] became Bergson's main disciple</span>
				<span class='text'>Nonetheless, Suzanne Guerlac has argued that his institutional position at the Collège de France, delivering lectures to a general audience, may have retarded the systematic reception of his thought: &quot;Bergson achieved enormous popular success in this context, often due to the emotional appeal of his ideas</span>
				<span class='text'> But he did not have the equivalent of graduate students who might have become rigorous interpreters of his thought</span>
				<span class='text'> Thus Bergson's philosophy--in principle open and nonsystematic--was easily borrowed piecemeal and altered by enthusiastic admirers&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Still others have characterized his philosophy as a [[emergent materialism|materialist emergentism]] — [[Samuel Alexander]] and [[C</span>
				<span class='text'>Lloyd Morgan]] explicitly claimed Bergson as their forebear</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Fagot-Largeau/&gt; According to Henri Hude (1990, II, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;142), who supports himself on the whole of Bergson's works as well as his now published courses, accusing him of pantheism is a &quot;counter-sense&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Hude alleges that a [[mysticism|mystical experience]], roughly outlined at the end of ''Les Deux sources de la morale et de la religion'', is the inner principle of his whole philosophy, although this has been contested by other commentators</span>
				<span class='text'>[Charles Sanders Peirce]] took strong exception to those who associated him with Bergson</span>
				<span class='text'>In response to a letter comparing his work with that of Bergson he wrote, “a man who seeks to further science can hardly commit a greater sin than to use the terms of his science without anxious care to use them with strict accuracy; it is not very gratifying to my feelings to be classed along with a Bergson who seems to be doing his utmost to muddle all distinctions</span>
				<span class='text'> [[William James]]’s students resisted the assimilation of his work to that of Bergson</span>
				<span class='text'>See, for example, [[Horace Kallen]]’s book on the subject ''James and Bergson''</span>
				<span class='text'>As [[Jean Wahl]] described the “ultimate disagreement” between James and Bergson in his ''System of Metaphysics'': “for James, the consideration of action is necessary for the definition of truth, according to Bergson, action</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ust be kept from our mind if we want to see the truth”{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</span>
				<span class='text'>Gide even went so far as to say that future historians will overestimate Bergson’s influence on art and philosophy just because he was the self-appointed spokesman for “the spirit of the age”</span>
				<span class='text'>s early as the 1890s, Santayana attacked certain key concepts in Bergson’s philosophy, above all his view of the New and the indeterminate:&lt;blockquote&gt;the possibility of a new and unaccountable fact appearing at any time,” he writes in his book on [[Hermann Lotze]], “does not practically affect the method of investigation;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>he only thing given up is the hope that these hypotheses may ever be adequate to the reality and cover the process of nature without leaving a remainder</span>
				<span class='text'>This is no great renunciation; for that consummation of science</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>s by no one really expected</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Santayana and Russell, Bergson projected false claims onto the aspirations of scientific method, claims which Bergson needed to make in order to justify his prior moral commitment to freedom</span>
				<span class='text'>Russell takes particular exception to Bergson’s understanding of number in chapter two of ''Time and Free-will''</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Russell, Bergson uses an outmoded spatial metaphor (“extended images”) to describe the nature of mathematics as well as [[logic]] in general</span>
				<span class='text'>“Bergson only succeeds in making his theory of number possible by confusing a particular collection with the number of its terms, and this again with number in general”, writes Russell (see ''The Philosophy of Bergson''{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} and ''A History of Western Philosophy''{{Page needed|date=September 2010}})</span>
				<span class='text'>urthermore, writers such as Russell, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], and James saw ''élan vital'' as a projection of subjectivity onto the world</span>
				<span class='text'>The external world, according to certain{{Which|date=November 2009}} theories of [[probability]], provides less and less indeterminism with further refinement of scientific method</span>
				<span class='text'>In brief, one should not confuse the moral, psychological, subjective demand for the new, the underivable and the unexplained with the universe</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} One's subjective sense of duration differs the (non-human) world, a difference which, according to the ancient materialist [[Lucretius]] should not be characterized as either one of becoming or being, creation or destruction (''[[De Rerum Natura]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>[Suzanne Guerlac]] has argued that the more recent resurgence of scholarly interest in Bergson is related to the growing influence of his follower [[Deleuze]] within [[continental philosophy]]: &quot;If there is a return to Bergson today, then, it is largely due to Gilles Deleuze whose own work has etched the contours of the New Bergson</span>
				<span class='text'> This is not only because Deleuze wrote about Bergson; it is also because Deleuze's own thought is deeply engaged with that of his predecessor, even when Bergson is not explicitly mentioned</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Guerlac, ''Thinking in Time: An Introduction to Henri Bergson'', Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2006, p</span>
				<span class='text'>175</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Lawlor]] and Valentine Moulard agree with Guerlac that &quot;the recent revitalization of Bergsonism [</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> is almost entirely due to Deleuze</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  They explain that Bergson's concept of multiplicity &quot;is at the very heart of Deleuze's thought, and [[Duration (philosophy)|duration]] is the model for all of Deleuze's 'becomings</span>
				<span class='text'>  The other aspect that attracted Deleuze, which is indeed connected to the first, is Bergson's criticism of the concept of negation in Creative Evolution</span>
				<span class='text'>[</span>
