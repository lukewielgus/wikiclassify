				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;The effect of Derrida's paper was such that by the time the conference proceedings were published in 1970, the title of the collection had become ''The Structuralist Controversy''</span>
				<span class='text'>The conference was also where he met [[Paul de Man]], who would be a close friend and source of great controversy, as well as where he first met the French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]], with whose work Derrida enjoyed a mixed relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>==Phenomenology vs structuralism debate (1959)===In the early 1960s, Derrida began speaking and writing publicly, addressing the most topical debates at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>One of these was the new and increasingly fashionable movement of [[structuralism]], which was being widely favoured as the successor to the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] approach, the latter having been started by Husserl sixty years earlier</span>
				<span class='text'>Derrida's countercurrent take on the issue, at a prominent international conference, was so influential that it reframed the discussion from a celebration of the triumph of structuralism to a &quot;phenomenology vs structuralism debate</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Phenomenology, as envisioned by Husserl, is a method of philosophical inquiry that rejects the rationalist bias that has dominated Western thought since [[Plato]] in favor of a method of reflective attentiveness that discloses the individual's &quot;lived experience;&quot; for those with a more phenomenological bent, the goal was to understand experience by comprehending and describing its genesis, the process of its emergence from an origin or event</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} For the structuralists, this was a false problem, and the &quot;depth&quot; of experience could in fact only be an effect of structures which are not themselves experiential</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}In that context, in 1959, Derrida asked the question: Must not structure have a genesis, and must not the origin, the point of genesis, be ''already'' structured, in order to be the genesis ''of'' something?&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, &quot;'Genesis' and 'Structure' and Phenomenology,&quot; in ''Writing and Difference'' (London: Routledge, 1978), paper originally delivered in 1959 at Cerisy-la-Salle, and originally published in Gandillac, Goldmann &amp; Piaget (eds</span>
				<span class='text'>, ''Genèse et structure'' (The Hague: Morton, 1964), p</span>
				<span class='text'>167:{{quotation|All these formulations have been possible thanks to the initial distinction between different irreducible types of genesis and structure: worldly genesis and transcendental genesis, empirical structure, eidetic structure, and transcendental structure</span>
				<span class='text'>To ask oneself the following historico-semantic question: &quot;What does the notion of genesis ''in general'', on whose basis the Husserlian diffraction could come forth and be understood, mean, and what has it always meant? What does the notion of structure ''in general'', on whose basis Husserl ''operates'' and operates distinctions between empirical, eidetic, and transcendental dimensions mean, and what has it always meant throughout its displacements? And what is the historico-semantic relationship between genesis and structure ''in general''?&quot; is not only simply to ask a prior linguistic question</span>
				<span class='text'>It is to ask the question about the unity of the historical ground on whose basis a transcendental reduction is possible and is motivated by itself</span>
				<span class='text'>It is to ask the question about the unity of the world from which transcendental freedom releases itself, in order to make the origin of this unity appear</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, every structural or &quot;synchronic&quot; phenomenon has a history, and the structure cannot be understood without understanding its genesis</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;If in 1959 Derrida was addressing this question of genesis and structure to Husserl, that is, to phenomenology, then in &quot;Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences&quot; (also in ''Writing and Difference'', and see below), he addresses these same questions to Lévi-Strauss and the structuralists</span>
				<span class='text'>This is clear from the very first line of the paper (p</span>
				<span class='text'>278):{{quotation|Perhaps something has occurred in the history of the concept of structure that could be called an &quot;event,&quot; if this loaded word did not entail a meaning which it is precisely the function of structural—or structuralist—thought to reduce or to suspect</span>
				<span class='text'>}Between these two papers is staked Derrida's philosophical ground, if not indeed his step beyond or outside philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, in order that there be movement, or potential, the origin cannot be some pure unity or simplicity, but must already be articulated—complex—such that from it a &quot;diachronic&quot; process can emerge</span>
				<span class='text'>This originary complexity must not be understood as an original ''positing'', but more like a default of origin, which Derrida refers to as iterability, inscription, or textuality</span>

				<span class='text'> From this point of view, I would even say that the alterity of the other ''inscribes'' in this relationship that which in no case can be &quot;posed</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Inscription, as I would define it in this respect, is not a simple position: it is rather that by means of which every position is ''of itself confounded'' (''différance''): inscription, mark, text and not only ''thesis or theme''-inscription of the ''thesis''</span>
				<span class='text'>}On the phrase &quot;default of origin&quot; as applied to Derrida's work, cf</span>

				<span class='text'> ''Jacques Derrida and the Humanities'' (Cambridge &amp; New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001)</span>
				<span class='text'>Stiegler understands Derrida's thinking of textuality and inscription in terms of a thinking of originary technicity, and in this context speaks of &quot;the originary default of origin that arche-writing constitutes&quot; (p</span>
				<span class='text'>239)</span>
				<span class='text'>See also Stiegler, ''[[Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus]]'' (Stanford: [[Stanford University Press]], 1998)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It is this thought of originary complexity that sets Derrida's work in motion, and from which all of its terms are derived, including &quot;deconstruction&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;It is opposed to the concept of original purity, which destabilises the thought of both &quot;genesis&quot; and &quot;structure&quot;, cf</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Rodolphe Gasché]], ''The Tain of the Mirror'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts, &amp; London: Harvard University Press, 1986), p</span>
				<span class='text'>146:{{quotation|It is an opening that is structural, or the structurality of an opening</span>
				<span class='text'>Yet each of these concepts excludes the other</span>
				<span class='text'>It is thus as little a structure as it is an opening; it is as little static as it is genetic, as little structural as it is historical</span>
				<span class='text'>It can be understood neither from a genetic nor from a structuralist and taxonomic point of view, nor from a combination of both points of view</span>
				<span class='text'>}And note that this complexity of the origin is thus not only spatial but temporal, which is why ''différance'' is a matter not only of difference but of delay or deferral</span>
				<span class='text'>One way in which this question is raised in relation to Husserl is thus the question of the possibility of a phenomenology of ''history'', which Derrida raises in ''Edmund Husserl's Origin of Geometry: An Introduction'' (1962)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Derrida's method consisted in demonstrating the forms and varieties of this originary complexity, and their multiple consequences in many fields</span>
				<span class='text'>He achieved this by conducting thorough, careful, sensitive, and yet transformational readings of philosophical and literary texts, to determine what aspects of those texts run counter to their apparent systematicity (structural unity) or intended sense (authorial genesis)</span>
				<span class='text'>By demonstrating the [[aporia]]s and ellipses of thought, Derrida hoped to show the infinitely subtle ways in which this originary complexity, which by definition cannot ever be completely known, works its structuring and destructuring effects</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cf</span>

				<span class='text'>3–4:{{quotation|One of the more persistent misunderstandings that has thus far forestalled a productive debate with Derrida's philosophical thought is the assumption, shared by many philosophers as well as literary critics, that within that thought just anything is possible</span>
				<span class='text'>Derrida's philosophy is more often than not construed as a license for arbitrary free play in flagrant disregard of all established rules of argumentation, traditional requirements of thought, and ethical standards binding upon the interpretative community</span>
				<span class='text'>Undoubtedly, some of the works of Derrida may not have been entirely innocent in this respect, and may have contributed, however obliquely, to fostering to some extent that very misconception</span>
				<span class='text'>But deconstruction which for many has come to designate the content and style of Derrida's thinking, reveals to even a superficial examination, a well-ordered procedure, a step-by-step type of argumentation based on an acute awareness of level-distinctions, a marked thoroughness and regularity</span>

				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;===1967–1972===Derrida's interests traversed disciplinary boundaries, and his knowledge of a wide array of diverse material was reflected in the three collections of work published in 1967: ''Speech and Phenomena'', ''[[Of Grammatology]]'' and ''Writing and Difference''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;67RonseP4&quot;&gt;Derrida (1967) interview with Henri Ronse, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>4–5 quote: &quot;[''Speech and Phenomena''] is perhaps the essay which I like most</span>
				<span class='text'>Doubtless I could have bound it as a long note to one or the other of the other two works</span>
				<span class='text'>''Of Grammatology'' refers to it and economizes its development</span>
				<span class='text'>But in a classical philosophical architecture, ''Speech</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>' would come first: in it is posed, at a point which appears juridically decisive for reasons that I cannot explain here, the question of the privilege of the voice and of phonetic writing in their relationship to the entire history of the West, such as this history can be represented by the history of metaphysics and metaphysics in its most modern, critical and vigilant form: Husserl's transcendental phenomenology</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;On several occasions Derrida has acknowledged his debt to [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], and stated that without them he would have not said a single word</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;67RonseP8&quot;&gt;Derrida (1967) interview with Henri Ronse, p</span>
				<span class='text'>8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LetterJap&quot;&gt;On the influence of Heidegger, Derrida claims in his &quot;Letter to a Japanese Friend&quot; (''Derrida and [[différance]]'', eds</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Robert Bernasconi]] and [[David Wood (philosopher)|David Wood]]) that the word &quot;déconstruction&quot; was his attempt both to translate and re-appropriate for his own ends the Heideggerian terms ''Destruktion'' and ''Abbau'', via a word from the French language, the varied senses of which seemed consistent with his requirements</span>
				<span class='text'>This relationship with the Heideggerian term was chosen over the Nietzschean term &quot;demolition,&quot; as Derrida shared Heidegger's interest in renovating philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Among the questions asked in these essays are &quot;What is 'meaning', what are its historical relationships to what is purportedly identified under the rubric 'voice' as a value of presence, presence of the object, presence of meaning to consciousness, self-presence in so called living speech and in self-consciousness?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;67RonseP4&quot;/&gt; In another essay in ''Writing and Difference'' entitled &quot;Violence and Metaphysics: An Essay on the Thought of Emmanuel Levinas&quot;, the roots of another major theme in Derrida's thought emerges: the Other as opposed to the Same&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, J</span>

				<span class='text'>It follows the shifting role of ''Geist'' (spirit) through Heidegger's work, noting that, in 1927, &quot;spirit&quot; was one of the philosophical terms that Heidegger set his sights on dismantling</span>

				<span class='text'>eyond these explicit political interventions, however, Derrida was engaged in rethinking politics and the political itself, within and beyond philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>Derrida insisted that a distinct political undertone had pervaded his texts from the very beginning of his career</span>

				<span class='text'>==Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe===[[Jean-Luc Nancy]] and [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]] were among Derrida's first students in France and went on to become well-known and important philosophers in their own right</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite their considerable differences of subject, and often also of method, they continued their close interaction with each other and with Derrida, from the early 1970s</span>
				<span class='text'>errida wrote on both of them, including a long book on Nancy: ''Le Toucher, Jean-Luc Nancy'' (''On Touching—Jean-Luc Nancy'', 2005)</span>
				<span class='text'>==Paul de Man==={{Main|Paul de Man}}Derrida's most prominent friendship in intellectual life was with Paul de Man, which began with their meeting at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and continued until de Man's death in 1983</span>
				<span class='text'>De Man provided a somewhat different approach to deconstruction, and his readings of literary and philosophical texts were crucial in the training of a generation of readers</span>
				<span class='text'>hortly after de Man's death, Derrida authored a book ''Memoires: pour Paul de Man'' and in 1988 wrote an article in the journal ''[[Critical Inquiry]]'' called &quot;Like the Sound of the Sea Deep Within a Shell: Paul de Man's War&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The memoir became cause for controversy, because shortly before Derrida published his piece, it had been discovered by the Belgian literary critic Ortwin de Graef that long before his academic career in the US, de Man had written almost two hundred essays in a pro-Nazi newspaper during the [[History of Belgium#World War II|German occupation of Belgium]], including several that were explicitly [[antisemitic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>errida complicated the notion that it is possible to simply read de Man's later scholarship through the prism of these earlier political essays</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather, any claims about de Man's work should be understood in relation to the entire body of his scholarship</span>
				<span class='text'>Critics of Derrida have argued that he minimizes the antisemitic character of de Man's writing</span>

				<span class='text'>L</span>
				<span class='text'>Austin's theory of the illocutionary act</span>
				<span class='text'>While sympathetic to Austin's departure from a purely denotational account of language to one that includes &quot;force&quot;, Derrida was sceptical of the framework of normativity employed by Austin</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued that Austin had missed the fact that any speech event is framed by a &quot;structure of absence&quot; (the words that are left unsaid due to contextual constraints) and by &quot;iterability&quot; (the constraints on what can be said, given by what has been said in the past)</span>
				<span class='text'>Derrida argued that the focus on [[intentionality]] in speech-act theory was misguided because intentionality is restricted to that which is already established as a possible intention</span>
				<span class='text'>He also took issue with the way Austin had excluded the study of fiction, non-serious or &quot;parasitic&quot; speech, wondering whether this exclusion was because Austin had considered these speech genres governed by different structures of meaning, or simply due to a lack of interest</span>
				<span class='text'>In his brief reply to Derrida, &quot;Reiterating the Differences: A Reply to Derrida&quot;, Searle argued that Derrida's critique was unwarranted because it assumed that Austin's theory attempted to give a full account of language and meaning when its aim was much narrower</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;{{quotation| In the description of the structure called &quot;normal,&quot; &quot;normative,&quot; &quot;central,&quot; &quot;ideal,&quot;this possibility must be integrated as an essential possibility</span>
				<span class='text'>The possibility cannot be treated as though it were a simple accident-marginal or parasitic</span>
				<span class='text'>It cannot be, and hence ought not to be, and this passage from can to ought reflects the entire difficulty</span>
				<span class='text'>In the analysis of so-called normal cases, one neither can nor ought, in all theoretical rigor, to exclude the possibility of transgression</span>
				<span class='text'>Not even provisionally, or out of allegedly methodological considerations</span>
				<span class='text'>It would be a poor method, since this possibility of transgression tells us immediately and indispensably about the structure of the act said to be normal as well as about the structure of law in general</span>
				<span class='text'>}He continued arguing how problematic was establishing the relation between &quot;nonfiction or standard discourse&quot; and &quot;fiction,&quot; defined as its &quot;parasite, “for part of the most originary essence of the latter is to allow fiction, the simulacrum, parasitism, to take place-and in so doing to &quot;de-essentialize&quot; itself as it were”</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Afterwordsp133&quot;&gt;Jacques Derrida, &quot;Afterwords&quot; in ''Limited, Inc</span>
				<span class='text'>' (Northwestern University Press, 1988), p</span>
				<span class='text'>133&lt;/ref&gt; He would finally argue that the indispensable question would then become:&lt;ref name=&quot;Afterwordsp133&quot; /&gt;{{quotation|what is &quot;nonfiction standard discourse,&quot; what must it be and what does this name evoke, once its fictionality or its fictionalization, its transgressive &quot;parasitism,&quot; is always possible (and moreover by virtue of the very same words, the same phrases, the same grammar, etc</span>
				<span class='text'>?  This question is all the more indispensable since the rules, and even the statements of the rules governing the relations of &quot;nonfiction standard discourse&quot; and its fictional&quot;parasites,&quot; are not things found in nature, but laws, symbolic inventions, or conventions, institutions that, in their very normality as well as in their normativity, entail something of the fictional</span>
				<span class='text'>}In the debate, Derrida praises Austin's work, but argues that he is wrong to banish what Austin calls &quot;infelicities&quot; from the &quot;normal&quot; operation of language</span>
				<span class='text'>One &quot;infelicity,&quot; for instance, occurs when it cannot be known whether a given speech act is &quot;sincere&quot; or &quot;merely citational&quot; (and therefore possibly ironic, etc</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Derrida argues that every iteration is necessarily &quot;citational,&quot; due to the graphematic nature of speech and writing, and that language could not work at all without the ever-present and ineradicable possibility of such alternate readings</span>
				<span class='text'>Derrida takes Searle to task for his attempt to get around this issue by grounding final authority in the speaker's inaccessible &quot;intention&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Derrida argues that intention cannot possibly govern how an iteration signifies, once it becomes hearable or readable</span>
				<span class='text'>All speech acts borrow a language whose significance is determined by historical-linguistic context, and by the alternate possibilities that this context makes possible</span>
				<span class='text'>This significance, Derrida argues, cannot be altered or governed by the whims of intention</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1994, Searle argued that the ideas upon which ''deconstruction'' is founded are essentially a consequence of a series of conceptual confusions made by Derrida as a result of his outdated knowledge or are merely banalities</span>
				<span class='text'> He insisted that Derrida's conception of ''iterability'' and its alleged &quot;corrupting&quot; effect on meaning stems from Derrida's ignorance of the [[type–token distinction]] that exists in current [[linguistics]] and [[philosophy of language]]</span>
				<span class='text'> As Searle explains, &quot;Most importantly, from the fact that different tokens of a sentence type can be uttered on different occasions with different intentions, that is, different speaker meanings, nothing of any significance follows about the original speaker meaning of the original utterance token</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Searle 1994&quot;/&gt;In 1995, Searle gave a brief reply to Derrida in ''The Construction of Social Reality''</span>
				<span class='text'>He called Derrida's conclusion &quot;preposterous&quot; and stated that &quot;Derrida, as far as I can tell, does not have an argument</span>
				<span class='text'>He simply declares that there is nothing outside of texts</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>57-160</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Searle's reference here is not to anything forwarded in the debate, but to a mistranslation of the phrase &quot;''il n'y a pas dehors du texte'',&quot; (&quot;There is no outside-text&quot;) which appears in Derrida's ''[[Of Grammatology]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>Johns Hopkins University Press</span>
				<span class='text'>Baltimore, 1976, 158-59&lt;/ref&gt;According to Searle, the consistent pattern of Derrida's rhetoric is: &lt;br&gt;(a) announce a preposterous thesis, e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;there is no outside-text&quot; (''il n'y a pas de hors-texte''); &lt;br&gt;(b) when challenged on ''(a)'' respond that you have been misunderstood and revise the claim in ''(a)'' such that it becomes a truism, e</span>

				<span class='text'>Indeed, the violence of these denunciations derives from the fact that the work accused is part of a whole ongoing process</span>
				<span class='text'>What is unfolding here, like the resistance it necessarily arouses, can't be limited to a personal &quot;oeuvre,&quot; nor to a discipline, nor even to the academic institution</span>
				<span class='text'>Nor in particular to a generation: it's often the active involvement of students and younger teachers which makes certain of our colleagues nervous to the point that they lose their sense of moderation and of the academic rules they invoke when they attack me and my work</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;br&gt;If this work seems so threatening to them, this is because it isn't simply eccentric or strange, incomprehensible or exotic (which would allow them to dispose of it easily), but as I myself hope, and as they believe more than they admit, competent, rigorously argued, and carrying conviction in its re-examination of the fundamental norms and premises of a number of dominant discourses, the principles underlying many of their evaluations, the structures of academic institutions, and the research that goes on within them</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Bataille, Blanchot, Levinas, Heidegger, Nietzsche), leads to a corrosive nihilism</span>
				<span class='text'>{Page needed|date=November 2010}} For example, Wolin argues that the &quot;deconstructive gesture of overturning and reinscription ends up by threatening to efface many of the essential differences between Nazism and non-Nazism&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-262-73101-0&lt;/ref&gt;In 1991, when Wolin published a Derrida interview on Heidegger in the first edition of ''The Heidegger Controversy'', Derrida argued that the interview was an intentionally malicious mistranslation, which was &quot;demonstrably execrable&quot; and &quot;weak, simplistic, and compulsively aggressive&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>As French law requires the consent of an author to translations and this consent was not given, Derrida insisted that the interview not appear in any subsequent editions or reprints</span>
				<span class='text'>Columbia University Press subsequently refused to offer reprints or new editions</span>
				<span class='text'>Later editions of ''The Heidegger Controversy'' by MIT Press also omitted the Derrida interview</span>
				<span class='text'>The matter achieved public exposure owing to a friendly review of Wolin's book by Thomas Sheehan that appeared in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', in which Sheehan characterised Derrida's protests as an imposition of censorship</span>
