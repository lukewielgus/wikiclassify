				<span class='text'>=Early years==Born in [[Paris]], d'Alembert was the [[illegitimate child]] of the writer [[Claudine Gu√©rin de Tencin]] and the chevalier [[Louis-Camus Destouches]], an [[artillery]] officer</span>
				<span class='text'>Destouches was abroad at the time of d'Alembert's birth, and a couple of days after birth his mother left him on the steps of the [[Saint-Jean-le-Rond de Paris]] church</span>
				<span class='text'>According to custom, he was named after the [[patron saint]] of the church</span>
				<span class='text'>D'Alembert was placed in an [[orphanage]] for found children, but his father found him and placed him with the wife of a [[glazier]], Madame Rousseau, with whom he lived for nearly 50 years</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/details/friendsofvoltair00hallrich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Destouches secretly paid for the education of Jean le Rond, but did not want his [[Paternity (law)|paternity]] officially recognized</span>
				<span class='text'>=Studies and adult life==D'Alembert first attended a private school</span>
				<span class='text'>The chevalier Destouches left d'Alembert an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] of 1200 [[French livre|livres]] on his death in 1726</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the influence of the Destouches family, at the age of twelve d'Alembert entered the [[Jansenism|Jansenist]] [[Coll√®ge des Quatre-Nations]] (the institution was also known under the name &quot;Coll√®ge Mazarin&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he studied [[philosophy]], [[law]], and the [[art]]s, graduating  as ''[[Bachelor of Arts|baccalaur√©at en arts]]'' in 1735</span>
				<span class='text'>In his later life, D'Alembert scorned the [[Ren√© Descartes|Cartesian]] principles he had been taught by the Jansenists: &quot;physical promotion, innate ideas and the vortices&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>he Jansenists steered D'Alembert toward an [[ecclesiastical]] career, attempting to deter him from pursuits such as [[poetry]] and [[mathematics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Theology]] was, however, &quot;rather unsubstantial fodder&quot; for d'Alembert</span>
				<span class='text'>He entered law school for two years, and was nominated ''[[Lawyer|avocat]]'' in 1738</span>
				<span class='text'>e was also interested in [[medicine]] and mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>Jean was first registered under the name ''Daremberg'', but later changed it to ''d'Alembert''</span>
				<span class='text'>The name &quot;d'Alembert&quot; was proposed by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] for a suspected (but non-existent) moon of [[Venus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}==Career=={{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Scientists}}In July 1739 he made his first contribution to the field of mathematics, pointing out the errors he had detected in ''[[L'analyse d√©montr√©e]]'' (published 1708 by [[Charles Ren√© Reynaud]]) in a communication addressed to the [[French Academy of Sciences|Acad√©mie des Sciences]]</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time ''L'analyse d√©montr√©e'' was a standard work, which d'Alembert himself had used to study the [[foundations of mathematics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>D'Alembert was also a [[Latin]] scholar of some note and worked in the latter part of his life on a superb translation of [[Tacitus]], for which he received wide praise including that of [[Denis Diderot]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1740, he submitted his second [[science|scientific]] work from the field of [[fluid dynamics|fluid mechanics]] ''M√©moire sur la r√©fraction des corps solides'', which was recognized by [[Alexis Clairault|Clairaut]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In this work d'Alembert theoretically explained [[refraction]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1741, after several failed attempts, d'Alembert was elected into the Acad√©mie des Sciences</span>

				<span class='text'>He authored over a thousand articles for it, including the famous ''[[Preliminary Discourse]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=lange/&gt; In this way, D'Alembert agreed with the [[Idealism|Idealist]] [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] and anticipated the [[Transcendental idealism]] of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]</span>

				<span class='text'>n 1754, d'Alembert was elected a member of the [[Acad√©mie fran√ßaise]], of which he became Permanent Secretary on 9 April 1772</span>

				<span class='text'>nder pressure from [[Jacob Vernes]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and others, d'Alembert eventually made the excuse that he considered anyone who did not accept the Church of Rome to be a Socinianist, and that was all he meant, and he abstained from further work on the encyclopedia following his response to the critique</span>

				<span class='text'>This article, written in conjunction with [[Diderot]], would later form the basis of Rameau's 1750 treatise ''D√©monstration du principe de l'harmonie''</span>
				<span class='text'>D'Alembert wrote a glowing review praising the author‚Äôs deductive character as an ideal scientific model</span>
				<span class='text'>He saw in Rameau‚Äôs music theories support for his own scientific ideas, a fully systematic method with a strongly deductive synthetic structure</span>
				<span class='text'>wo years later in 1752, d'Alembert attempted a fully comprehensive survey of Rameau's works in his ''El√©ments de musique th√©orique et pratique suivant les principes de M</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Emphasizing Rameau's main claim that music was a mathematical science that had a single principle from which could be deduced all the elements and rules of musical practice as well as the explicit Cartesian methodology employed, d'Alembert helped to popularize the work of the composer and advertise his own theories</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;CT&quot;/&gt; He claims to have &quot;clarified, developed, and simplified&quot; the principles of Rameau, arguing that the single idea of the ''[[corps sonore]]'' was not sufficient to derive the entirety of music</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  D'Alembert instead claimed that three principles would be necessary to generate the major [[musical mode]], the minor mode, and the identity of [[octaves]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Because he was not a musician, however, d'Alembert misconstrued the finer points of Rameau's thinking, changing and removing concepts that would not fit neatly into his understanding of music</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough initially grateful, Rameau eventually turned on d'Alembert while voicing his increasing dissatisfaction with [[J</span>

				<span class='text'>A long preliminary discourse d'Alembert wrote for the 1762 edition of his ''El√©mens'' attempted to summarize the dispute and act as a final rebuttal</span>
				<span class='text'>'Alembert also discussed various aspects of the state of music in his celebrated ''Discours pr√©liminaire'' of [[Diderot]]'s ''Encyclop√©die''</span>
				<span class='text'>D'Alembert claims that, compared to the other arts, music, &quot;which speaks simultaneously to the imagination and the senses,&quot; has not been able to represent or imitate as much of reality because of the &quot;lack of sufficient inventiveness and resourcefulness of those who cultivate it</span>
