				<span class='text'>One contemporary source is the ''[[Brief Lives]]'' of [[John Aubrey]], an uneven compilation including first-hand reports</span>
				<span class='text'>In the work, Aubrey quotes Christopher, Milton's younger brother: &quot;When he was young, he studied very hard and sat up very late, commonly till twelve or one o'clock at night&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>in 1629,&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MLTN624J|name=Milton, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ranked fourth of 24&amp;nbsp;honours graduates that year in the University of Cambridge</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Preparing to become an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest, Milton stayed on to obtain his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts degree]] on 3&amp;nbsp;July 1632</span>
				<span class='text'>ilton was probably [[rustication (academia)|rusticated]] (suspended) for quarrelling in his first year with his tutor, Bishop [[William Chappell (bishop)|William Chappell]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was certainly at home in the Lent Term 1626; there he wrote his ''Elegia Prima'', a first Latin [[elegy]], to Charles Diodati, a friend from St Paul's</span>
				<span class='text'>Based on remarks of [[John Aubrey]], Chappell &quot;whipt&quot; Milton</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=OLD/&gt; This story is now disputed, though certainly Milton disliked Chappell</span>

				<span class='text'>178</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] cautiously notes that Milton was &quot;apparently&quot; rusticated, and that the differences between Chappell and Milton may have been either religious or personal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hill 1977 p</span>
				<span class='text'>34</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that, like [[Isaac Newton]] four decades later, Milton was sent home because of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], by which Cambridge was badly affected in 1625</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, in 1626, Milton's tutor was Nathaniel Tovey</span>
				<span class='text'>t Cambridge, Milton was on good terms with [[Edward King (British poet)|Edward King]], for whom he later wrote ''[[Lycidas]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He also befriended Anglo-American dissident and theologian [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Milton tutored Williams in Hebrew in exchange for lessons in Dutch</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer 1955 pp</span>
				<span class='text'>363‚Äì373</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; At Cambridge Milton developed a reputation for poetic skill and general erudition, but experienced alienation from his peers and university life as a whole</span>
				<span class='text'>Watching his fellow students attempting comedy upon the college stage, he later observed 'they thought themselves gallant men, and I thought them fools'</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Milton 1959 pp</span>
				<span class='text'>887‚Äì8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Milton was disdainful of the university curriculum, which consisted of stilted formal debates on abstruse topics, conducted in Latin</span>
				<span class='text'>His own corpus is not devoid of humour, notably his sixth [[wikt:prolusion|prolusion]] and his epitaphs on the death of [[Thomas Hobson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While at Cambridge he wrote a number of his well-known shorter English poems, among them ''On the Morning of Christ's Nativity'', his ''Epitaph on the admirable Dramatick Poet, W</span>

				<span class='text'>He also lived at [[Horton, Berkshire]], from 1635 and undertook six years of self-directed private study</span>
				<span class='text'>Christopher Hill argues that this was not retreat into a rural idyll: Hammersmith was then a &quot;suburban village&quot; falling into the orbit of London, and even Horton was becoming deforested, and suffered from the plague</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hill 1977 p</span>
				<span class='text'>38</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He read both ancient and modern works of [[theology]], philosophy, history, politics, literature and science, in preparation for a prospective poetical career</span>
				<span class='text'>Milton's intellectual development can be charted via entries in his [[commonplace book]] (like a scrapbook), now in the [[British Library]]</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result of such intensive study, Milton is considered to be among the most learned of all English poets</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to his years of private study, Milton had command of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, Spanish, and Italian from his school and undergraduate days; he also added Old English to his linguistic repertoire in the 1650s while researching his ''History of Britain'', and probably acquired proficiency in Dutch soon after</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lewalski 2003 p</span>
				<span class='text'>103</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Milton continued to write poetry during this period of study: his ''[[Arcades (Milton)|Arcades]]'' and ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'' were both commissioned for [[masques]] composed for noble patrons, connections of the Egerton family, and performed in 1632 and 1634 respectively</span>
				<span class='text'>''Comus'' argues for the virtuousness of [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] and [[chastity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>e contributed his [[pastoral]] [[elegy]] ''[[Lycidas]]'' to a memorial collection for one of his Cambridge classmates</span>
				<span class='text'>Drafts of these poems are preserved in Milton‚Äôs poetry notebook, known as the Trinity Manuscript because it is now kept at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n May 1638, Milton embarked upon a tour of France and Italy that lasted up to July or August 1639</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chaney 1985 and 2000</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His travels supplemented his study with new and direct experience of artistic and religious traditions, especially Roman Catholicism</span>
				<span class='text'>He met famous theorists and intellectuals of the time, and was able to display his poetic skills</span>
				<span class='text'>For specific details of what happened within Milton's &quot;[[grand tour]]&quot;, there appears to be just one [[primary source]]: Milton's own ''[[Defensio Secunda]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Although there are other records, including some letters and some references in his other prose tracts, the bulk of the information about the tour comes from a work that, according to [[Barbara Lewalski]], &quot;was not intended as autobiography but as rhetoric, designed to emphasise his sterling reputation with the learned of Europe</span>

				<span class='text'>Milton left France soon after this meeting</span>

				<span class='text'>While there, Milton enjoyed many of the sites and structures of the city</span>
				<span class='text'>His candour of manner and erudite neo-Latin poetry earned him friends in Florentine intellectual circles, and he met the astronomer [[Galileo]], who was under [[house arrest]] at [[Arcetri]], as well as others</span>

				<span class='text'>e left Florence in September to continue to Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>With the connections from Florence, Milton was able to have easy access to Rome's intellectual society</span>
				<span class='text'>His poetic abilities impressed those like Giovanni Salzilli, who praised Milton within an epigram</span>
				<span class='text'>In late October, Milton, despite his dislike for the [[Society of Jesus]], attended a dinner given by the [[English College, Rome]], meeting English Catholics who were also guests, theologian [[Henry Holden]] and the poet [[Patrick Cary]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Milton in fact stayed another seven months on the continent, and spent time at [[Geneva]] with Diodati's uncle after he returned to Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Defensio Secunda'', Milton proclaimed he was warned against a return to Rome because of his frankness about religion, but he stayed in the city for two months and was able to experience [[Carnival]] and meet [[Lukas Holste]], a Vatican librarian, who guided Milton through its collection</span>
				<span class='text'>He was introduced to Cardinal [[Francesco Barberini (1597‚Äì1679)|Francesco Barberini]] who invited Milton to an opera hosted by the Cardinal</span>
				<span class='text'>Around March Milton travelled once again to Florence, staying there for two months, attending further meetings of the academies, and spent time with friends</span>
				<span class='text'>After leaving Florence he travelled through Lucca, Bologna, and Ferrara before coming to [[Venice]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Venice, Milton was exposed to a model of Republicanism, later important in his political writings, but he soon found another model when he travelled to Geneva</span>

				<span class='text'>With frequent passages of real eloquence lighting up the rough controversial style of the period, and deploying a wide knowledge of church history, he vigorously attacked the High-church party of the Church of England and their leader, [[William Laud]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>making unlawful entry&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Eliot 1947 p</span>
				<span class='text'>63</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Literary legacy===Milton's use of [[blank verse]], in addition to his stylistic innovations (such as grandiloquence of voice and vision, peculiar diction and phraseology) influenced later poets</span>
				<span class='text'>At the time, poetic blank verse was considered distinct from its use in verse drama, and ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' was taken as a unique examplar</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury 1908 ii</span>
				<span class='text'>443</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Said [[Isaac Watts]] in 1734, &quot;Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Milton is esteemed the parent and author of blank verse among us&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Watts 1810 iv</span>
				<span class='text'>619</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Miltonic verse&quot; might be synonymous for a century with blank verse as poetry, a new poetic terrain independent from both the drama and the [[heroic couplet]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ack of rhyme was sometimes taken as Milton's defining innovation</span>
				<span class='text'>He himself considered the rhymeless quality of ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' to be an extension of his own personal liberty:{{quote|This neglect then of Rhime&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>is to be esteem'd an example set, the first in English, of ancient liberty recover'd to heroic Poem from the troublesom and modern bondage of Rimeing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Milton 1668 xi</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}This pursuit of freedom was largely a reaction against conservative values entrenched within the rigid heroic couplet</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gordon 2008 p</span>
				<span class='text'>234</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Within a dominant culture that stressed elegance and finish, he granted primacy to freedom, breadth and imaginative suggestiveness, eventually developed into the romantic vision of sublime terror</span>
				<span class='text'>Reaction to Milton's poetic worldview included, grudgingly, acknowledgement that of poet's resemblance to classical writers (Greek and Roman poetry being unrhymed)</span>
				<span class='text'>Blank verse came to be a recognised medium for religious works and for translations of the classics</span>
				<span class='text'>Unrhymed lyrics like [[William Collins (poet)|Collins]]' ''[[Ode to Evening]]'' (in the meter of Milton's translation of [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ode to Pyrrha]]'') were not uncommon after 1740</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Dexter 1922 p</span>
				<span class='text'>46</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Temple of British Worthies John Milton</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Statue of Milton in [[Stowe House|Temple of British Worthies]], [[Stowe, Buckinghamshire|Stowe]]]]A second aspect of Milton's blank verse was the use of unconventional rhythm:{{quote|His blank-verse paragraph, and his audacious and victorious attempt to combine blank and rhymed verse with paragraphic effect in Lycidas, lay down indestructible models and patterns of English verse-rhythm, as distinguished from the narrower and more strait-laced forms of English metre</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury 1908 ii</span>
				<span class='text'>457</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}Before Milton, &quot;the sense of regular rhythm&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>had been knocked into the English head so securely that it was part of their nature&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury 1916 p</span>
				<span class='text'>101</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Heroick measure&quot;, according to [[Samuel Johnson]], &quot;is pure&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>when the accent rests upon every second syllable through the whole line&amp;nbsp; The repetition of this sound or percussion at equal times, is the most complete harmony of which a single verse is capable&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 1751 no</span>
				<span class='text'>86</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Caesura]]l pauses, most agreed, were best placed at the middle and the end of the line</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to support this symmetry, lines were most often octo- or deca-syllabic, with no [[enjambed]] endings</span>
				<span class='text'>To this schema Milton introduced modifications, which included [[hypermetric]]al [[syllable]]s (trisyllabic [[Foot (prosody)|feet]]), [[inversion (prosody)|inversion]] or slighting of [[stress (linguistics)|stresses]], and the shifting of pauses to all parts of the line</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Dexter 1922 p</span>
				<span class='text'>57</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Milton deemed these features to be reflective of &quot;the transcendental union of order and freedom&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury 1908 ii</span>
				<span class='text'>458‚Äì59</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Admirers remained hesitant to adopt such departures from traditional metrical schemes: ‚ÄúThe English&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>had been writing separate lines for so long that they could not rid themselves of the habit‚Äù</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Dexter 1922 p</span>
				<span class='text'>59</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Isaac Watts preferred his lines distinct from each other, as did [[Oliver Goldsmith]], [[Henry Pemberton]], and [[Scott of Amwell]], whose general opinion it was that Milton's frequent omission of the initial unaccented foot was &quot;displeasing to a nice ear&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury 1916 p</span>
				<span class='text'>114</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 18th century that poets (beginning with [[Thomas Gray|Gray]]) began to appreciate &quot;the composition of Milton's harmony&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>how he loved to vary his pauses, his measures, and his feet, which gives that enchanting air of freedom and wilderness to his versification&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gray 1748 ''Observations on English Metre''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;While [[neoclassicism|neo-classical]] diction was as restrictive as its [[prosody (poetry)|prosody]], and narrow imagery paired with uniformity of sentence structure resulted in a small set of 800 nouns circumscribing the vocabulary of 90% of heroic couplets ever written up to the eighteenth century,&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbaum 1996 p</span>
				<span class='text'>40</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and tradition required that the same adjectives attach to the same nouns, followed by the same verbs, Milton's pursuit of liberty extended into his vocabulary as well</span>
				<span class='text'>It included many Latinate [[neologism]]s, as well as obsolete words already dropped from popular usage so completely that their meanings were no longer understood</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1740, [[Francis Peck]] identified some examples of Milton's &quot;old&quot; words (now popular)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;They included &quot;self-same&quot;, &quot;hue&quot;, &quot;minstrelsy&quot;, &quot;murky&quot;, &quot;carol&quot;, and &quot;chaunt&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Among Milton's naturalized Latin words were &quot;humid&quot;, &quot;orient&quot;, &quot;hostil&quot;, &quot;facil&quot;, &quot;fervid&quot;, &quot;jubilant&quot;, &quot;ire&quot;, &quot;bland&quot;, &quot;reluctant&quot;, &quot;palpable&quot;, &quot;fragil&quot;, and &quot;ornate&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Peck 1740 pp</span>
				<span class='text'>110‚Äì111</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The ‚ÄúMiltonian dialect‚Äù as it was called, was emulated by later poets; Pope used the diction of ''Paradise Lost'' in his [[Homer]] translation, while the lyric poetry of Gray and Collins was frequently criticised for their use of ‚Äúobsolete words out of Spenser and Milton‚Äù</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Scott 1785 63</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The language of [[James Thomson (poet)|Thomson]]'s finest poems (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>''[[The Seasons (Thomson poem)|The Seasons]]'', ''[[Castle of Indolence]]'') was self-consciously modelled after the Miltonian dialect, with the same tone and sensibilities as ''Paradise Lost''</span>
				<span class='text'>Following to Milton, English poetry from Pope to [[John Keats]] exhibited a steadily increasing attention to the connotative, the imaginative and poetic, value of words</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Saintsbury 1908 ii</span>
				<span class='text'>468</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Musical settings===Milton's [[ode]] ''At a solemn Musick'' was set for choir and orchestra as ''[[Blest Pair of Sirens]]'' by [[Hubert Parry]] (1848-1918)</span>
				<span class='text'>Milton also wrote the hymn [[Let us with a gladsome mind]], a versification of Psalm 136</span>
