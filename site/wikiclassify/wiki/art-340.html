				<span class='text'>7&lt;/ref&gt;===Work===Hamsun first received wide acclaim with his 1890 novel [[Hunger (Hamsun novel)|''Hunger'' (''Sult'')]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The semiautobiographical work described a young writer's descent into near madness as a result of hunger and poverty in the Norwegian capital of [[Kristiania]] (modern name [[Oslo]])</span>
				<span class='text'>To many, the novel presages the writings of [[Franz Kafka]] and other twentieth-century novelists with its [[internal monologue]] and bizarre logic</span>
				<span class='text'> theme to which Hamsun often returned is that of the perpetual wanderer, an itinerant stranger (often the narrator) who shows up and insinuates himself into the life of small rural communities</span>
				<span class='text'>This wanderer theme is central to the novels ''[[Mysteries (novel)|Mysteries]]'', ''[[Pan (novel)|Pan]]'', ''Under the Autumn Star'', ''The Last Joy'', ''Vagabonds'', ''Rosa'', and others</span>
				<span class='text'> Hamsun‚Äôs prose often contains rapturous depictions of the natural world, with intimate reflections on the Norwegian woodlands and coastline</span>
				<span class='text'>For this reason, he has been linked with the spiritual movement known as [[pantheism]] (&quot;There is no God,&quot; he once wrote</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Only gods</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamsun saw mankind and nature united in a strong, sometimes mystical bond</span>
				<span class='text'>This connection between the characters and their natural environment is exemplified in the novels ''Pan'', ''A Wanderer Plays on Muted Strings'', and the epic ''[[Growth of the Soil]]'', &quot;his monumental work&quot; credited with securing him the [[Nobel Prize in literature]] in [[1920 in literature|1920]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He attributes the cause to Hamsun's deafness</span>
				<span class='text'>Regardless, Dietrich notes that it took Hitler three days to get over his anger</span>

				<span class='text'>tml&lt;/ref&gt;Nevertheless, a week after Hitler's death, [[Knut Hamsun's obituary of Adolf Hitler|Hamsun wrote a eulogy for him]], saying ‚ÄúHe was a warrior, a warrior for mankind, and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2009&quot;/&gt; Following the end of the war, angry crowds [[book burning|burned his books]] in public in major Norwegian cities and Hamsun was confined for several months in a psychiatric hospital</span>
				<span class='text'>amsun was forced to undergo a psychiatric examination, which concluded that he had &quot;permanently impaired mental faculties,&quot; and on that basis the charges of treason were dropped</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, a [[civil liability]] case was raised against him, and in 1948 he had to pay a ruinous sum to the Norwegian government of 325,000 [[Norwegian krone|kroner]] ($65,000 or ¬£16,250 at that time) for his alleged membership in [[Nasjonal Samling]] and for the moral support he gave to the Germans, but was cleared of any direct Nazi affiliation</span>
				<span class='text'>Whether he was a member of Nasjonal Samling or not and whether his mental abilities were impaired is a much debated issue even today</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamsun stated he was never a member of any political party</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} He wrote his last book ''Paa giengrodde Stier'' (''[[On Overgrown Paths]]'') in 1949, a book many take as evidence of his functioning mental capabilities</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} In it, he harshly criticizes the psychiatrists and the judges and, in his own words, proves that he is not mentally ill</span>
				<span class='text'>he Danish author [[Thorkild Hansen]] investigated the trial and wrote the book ''The Hamsun Trial'' (1978), which created a storm in Norway</span>
				<span class='text'>Among other things Hansen stated: &quot;If you want to meet idiots, go to Norway,&quot; as he felt that such treatment of the old Nobel Prize-winning author was outrageous</span>
				<span class='text'>In [[1996 in film|1996]] the Swedish director [[Jan Troell]] based the movie ''Hamsun'' on Hansen's book</span>
