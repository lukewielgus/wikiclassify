				<span class='text'>Who then in that case can rightly separate any unlawful lust whatever from the category of fornication if covetousness is fornication And from this we perceive that because of unlawful lusts not only those of which one is guilty in acts of uncleanness with anothers husband or wife but any unlawful lusts whatever which cause the soul making a bad use of the body to wander from the law of God and to be ruinously and basely corrupted a man may without crime put away his wife and a wife her husband because the Lord makes the cause of fornication an exception which fornication in accordance with the above considerations we are compelled to understand as being general and universal http  www</span>

				<span class='text'>Philosophy of teachingAugustine is considered an influential figure in the history of education</span>
				<span class='text'>A work early in Augustines writings is De Magistro On the Teacher which contains insights about education</span>
				<span class='text'>However his ideas changed as he found better directions or better ways of expressing his ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>In the last years of his life Saint Augustine wrote his Retractationes reviewing his writings and improving specific texts</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry Chadwick believes an accurate translation of retractationes may be reconsiderations</span>
				<span class='text'>Reconsiderations can be seen as an overarching theme of the way Saint Augustine learned</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustines understanding of the search for understanding meaning truth as a restless journey leaves room for doubt development and change</span>
				<span class='text'>name mccloskey Augustine was a strong advocate of critical thinking skills</span>
				<span class='text'>Because written works were still rather limited during this time spoken communication of knowledge was very important</span>
				<span class='text'>His emphasis on the importance of community as a means of learning distinguishes his pedagogy from some others</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustine believed that dialogue dialectic discussion is the best means for learning and this method should serve as a model for learning encounters between teachers and students</span>
				<span class='text'>Saint Augustine‚Äôs dialogue writings model the need for lively interactive dialogue among learners</span>

				<span class='text'>He recommended adapting educational practices to fit the students educational backgrounds the student who has been well educated by knowledgeable teachers the student who has had no education and the student who has had a poor education but believes himself to be well educated</span>
				<span class='text'>f a student has been well educated in a wide variety of subjects the teacher must be caul not to repeat what they have already learned but to challenge the student with material which they do not yet know thoroughly</span>
				<span class='text'>With the student who has had no education the teacher must be patient willing to repeat things until the student understands and sympathetic</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps the most difficult student however is the one with an inferior education who believes he understands something when he does not</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustine stressed the importance of showing this type of student the difference between having words and having understanding and of helping the student to remain humble with his acquisition of knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'> restrained style of teaching ensures the students full understanding of a concept because the teacher does not bombard the student with too much material focuses on one topic at a time helps them discover what they dont understand rather than moving on too quickly anticipates questions and helps them learn to solve difficulties and find solutions to problems</span>
				<span class='text'>ugustine believed that students should be given an opportunity to apply learned theories to practical experience</span>
				<span class='text'> Yet another of Augustines major contributions to education is his study on the styles of teaching</span>
				<span class='text'>He claimed there are two basic styles a teacher uses when speaking to the students</span>
				<span class='text'>The mixed style includes complex and sometimes showy language to help students see the beautiful artistry of the subject they are studying</span>
				<span class='text'>The grand style is not quite as elegant as the mixed style but is exciting and heartfelt with the purpose of igniting the same passion in the students hearts</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustine balanced his teaching philosophy with the traditional  based practice of strict discipline</span>
