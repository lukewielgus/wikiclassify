				<span class='text'>Augustine'' by [[Carlo Crivelli]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]Augustine developed his doctrine of the Church principally in reaction to the [[Donatist]] sect</span>
				<span class='text'>He taught that there is one Church, but that within this Church there are two realities, namely, the visible aspect (the institutional [[Catholic hierarchy|hierarchy]], the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Catholic sacraments]], and the laity) and the invisible (the souls of those in the Church, who are either dead, sinful members or elect predestined for Heaven)</span>
				<span class='text'>The former is the institutional body established by Christ on earth which proclaims salvation and administers the [[sacrament]]s while the latter is the invisible body of the elect, made up of genuine believers from all ages, and who are known only to God</span>
				<span class='text'>The Church, which is visible and societal, will be made up of &quot;wheat&quot; and &quot;tares&quot;, that is, good and wicked people (as per Mat</span>
				<span class='text'>13:30), until the end of time</span>
				<span class='text'>This concept countered the Donatist claim that only those in a [[state (theology)|state of grace]] were the &quot;true&quot; or &quot;pure&quot; church on earth, and that priests and bishops who were not in a state of grace had no authority or ability to confect the sacraments</span>

				<span class='text'>There he conceives of the church as a heavenly city or kingdom, ruled by love, which will ultimately triumph over all earthly empires which are self-indulgent and ruled by pride</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustine followed [[Cyprian]] in teaching that the bishops and priests of the Church are the [[apostolic succession|successors of the Apostles]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gonzalez&quot;/&gt; and that their authority in the Church is God-given</span>
				<span class='text'>==Eschatology===Augustine originally believed in [[premillennialism]], namely that Christ would establish a literal 1,000-year kingdom prior to the general [[resurrection]], but later rejected the belief, viewing it as carnal</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the first theologian to expound a systematic doctrine of [[amillennialism]], although some theologians and Christian historians believe his position was closer to that of modern [[postmillennialism|postmillennialists]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The mediaeval Catholic church built its system of eschatology on Augustinian amillennialism, where Christ rules the earth spiritually through his triumphant church</span>

				<span class='text'>The doctrine of illumination claims that God plays a part in human perception and understanding by illuminating the mind so that human beings can recognize intelligible realities that God presents</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Augustine, illumination is obtainable to all rational minds, and is different from other forms of sense perception</span>
				<span class='text'>It is meant to be an explanation of the conditions required for the mind to have a connection with intelligible entities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=encyclopedia/&gt; Augustine also posed the [[problem of other minds]] throughout different works, most famously perhaps in ''[[On the Trinity]]'' (VIII</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Augustine explained it in this way: &quot;Why therefore is it enjoined upon mind, that it should know itself? I suppose, in order that, it may consider itself, and live according to its own nature; that is, seek to be regulated according to its own nature, viz</span>
				<span class='text'> under Him to whom it ought to be subject, and above those things to which it is to be preferred; under Him by whom it ought to be ruled, above those things which it ought to rule</span>
				<span class='text'>For it does many things through vicious desire, as though in forgetfulness of itself</span>
				<span class='text'>For it sees some things intrinsically excellent, in that more excellent nature which is God: and whereas it ought to remain steadfast that it may enjoy them, it is turned away from Him, by wishing to appropriate those things to itself, and not to be like to Him by His gift, but to be what He is by its own, and it begins to move and slip gradually down into less and less, which it thinks to be more and more</span>

				<span class='text'>Regular sacraments are performed by clergy of the Catholic Church while sacraments performed by schismatics are considered irregular</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, the validity of the sacraments do not depend upon the holiness of the priests who perform them (''[[ex opere operato]]''); therefore, irregular sacraments are still accepted as valid provided they are done in the name of Christ and in the manner prescribed by the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>On this point Augustine departs from the earlier teaching of Cyprian, who taught that converts from schismatic movements must be re-baptised</span>

				<span class='text'>Augustine in His Study]]'' by [[Vittore Carpaccio]], 1502]]Augustine upheld the early Christian understanding of the [[Real Presence]] of Christ in the Eucharist, saying that Christ's statement, &quot;This is my body&quot; referred to the bread he carried in his hands,&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Explanations of the Psalms'' 33:1:10 [405]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Sermons'' 227 [411]&lt;/ref&gt; and that Christians must have faith that the bread and wine are in fact the body and blood of Christ, despite what they see with their eyes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''Sermons'' 272&lt;/ref&gt;Against the [[Pelagians]], Augustine strongly stressed the importance of [[infant baptism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>About the question whether baptism is an absolute necessity for salvation, however, Augustine appears to have refined his beliefs during his lifetime, causing some confusion among later theologians about his position</span>
				<span class='text'>He said in one of his sermons that only the baptized are saved</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''A Sermon to Catechumens on the Creed'', Paragraph 16&lt;/ref&gt; This belief was shared by many early Christians</span>
				<span class='text'>However, a passage from his ''City of God'', concerning the Apocalypse, may indicate that Augustine did believe in an exception for children born to Christian parents</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', Book 20, Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;===Statements on Jews===Against certain Christian movements, some of which rejected the use of Hebrew Scripture, Augustine countered that God had chosen the Jews as a special people,&lt;ref&gt;[[Diarmaid MacCulloch]]</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[The Reformation: A History]]'' (Penguin Group, 2005) p 8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and he considered the scattering of Jewish people by the Roman Empire to be a fulfillment of prophecy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', book 18, chapter 46</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He rejected homicidal attitudes, quoting part of the same prophecy, namely &quot;Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law&quot; (Psalm 59:11)</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustine, who believed Jewish people would be converted to Christianity at &quot;the end of time,&quot; argued that God had allowed them to survive their dispersion as a warning to Christians; as such, he argued, they should be permitted to dwell in Christian lands</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|''[[Saint Augustine in His Cell (Botticelli)|Saint Augustine in His Study]]'' by [[Sandro Botticelli]], 1494, [[Uffizi Gallery]]]]Augustine is considered an influential figure in the history of education</span>
				<span class='text'>A work early in Augustine's writings is ''De Magistro'' (On the Teacher), which contains insights about education</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his ideas changed as he found better directions or better ways of expressing his ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>In the last years of his life Saint Augustine wrote his &quot;Retractationes&quot;, reviewing his writings and improving specific texts</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry Chadwick believes an accurate translation of &quot;retractationes&quot; may be &quot;reconsiderations&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Reconsiderations can be seen as an overarching theme of the way Saint Augustine learned</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustine's understanding of the search for understanding/meaning/truth as a restless journey leaves room for doubt, development and change</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=mccloskey/&gt;Augustine was a strong advocate of critical thinking skills</span>
				<span class='text'>Because written works were still rather limited during this time, spoken communication of knowledge was very important</span>
				<span class='text'>His emphasis on the importance of community as a means of learning distinguishes his pedagogy from some others</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustine believed that dialogue/dialectic/discussion is the best means for learning, and this method should serve as a model for learning encounters between teachers and students</span>
				<span class='text'>Saint Augustine‚Äôs dialogue writings model the need for lively interactive dialogue among learners</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;He recommended adapting educational practices to fit the students' educational backgrounds:* the student who has been well-educated by knowledgeable teachers;* the student who has had no education; and* the student who has had a poor education, but believes himself to be well-educated</span>
				<span class='text'>f a student has been well educated in a wide variety of subjects, the teacher must be careful not to repeat what they have already learned, but to challenge the student with material which they do not yet know thoroughly</span>
				<span class='text'>With the student who has had no education, the teacher must be patient, willing to repeat things until the student understands, and sympathetic</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps the most difficult student, however, is the one with an inferior education who believes he understands something when he does not</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustine stressed the importance of showing this type of student the difference between &quot;having words and having understanding,&quot; and of helping the student to remain humble with his acquisition of knowledge</span>
				<span class='text'> ''restrained'' style of teaching ensures the students' full understanding of a concept because the teacher does not bombard the student with too much material; focuses on one topic at a time; helps them discover what they don't understand, rather than moving on too quickly; anticipates questions; and helps them learn to solve difficulties and find solutions to problems</span>
				<span class='text'>ugustine believed that students should be given an opportunity to apply learned theories to practical experience</span>
				<span class='text'> Yet another of Augustine's major contributions to education is his study on the styles of teaching</span>
				<span class='text'>He claimed there are two basic styles a teacher uses when speaking to the students</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''mixed style'' includes complex and sometimes showy language to help students see the beautiful artistry of the subject they are studying</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''grand style'' is not quite as elegant as the mixed style, but is exciting and heartfelt, with the purpose of igniting the same passion in the students' hearts</span>
				<span class='text'>Augustine balanced his teaching philosophy with the traditional [[Bible]]-based practice of strict discipline</span>
