				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Though conservative, he did originate and advance new theology to the early Church</span>
				<span class='text'>He is perhaps most famous for being the oldest extant Latin writer to use the term ''[[Trinity]]'' (Latin: ''Trinitas''),&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Trinitas&quot; is itself a Latinization of the Greek &quot;he trias&quot; (the Triad), a term that was used earlier than Tertullian by [[Theophilus of Antioch]] in ''Ad Autolycum'' 2</span>
				<span class='text'>5 to refer to God, God's Logos (Jesus), and God's Sophia (Holy Spirit)&lt;/ref&gt; and giving the oldest extant formulation of the Trinitarian terminology later adopted at the [[First Council of Nicaea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In ''Adversus Praxean''; see Barnes for a summary of the work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Other Latin formulations that first appear in his work are &quot;three persons, one substance&quot; as the Latin &quot;tres [[persona]]e, [[Consubstantial|una substantia]]&quot; (itself from the [[Koine Greek]] &quot;treis [[Hypostasis (religion)|hypostases]], [[Ousios|homoousios]]&quot;)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;gonzales&quot; /&gt; He wrote his trinitarian formula after becoming a [[Montanist]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;gonzales&quot; /&gt; However, unlike many [[Church fathers]], he was never recognized as a [[Saint#Christianity|saint]] by the Church, as several of his later teachings on issues such as remarriage for widows and persecution contradicted the teachings of the Church</span>
				<span class='text'>= Life ==Scant reliable evidence exists to inform us about Tertullian's life</span>
				<span class='text'>Most history about him comes from passing references in his own writings</span>
				<span class='text'>oman Africa was famous as the home of orators and this influence can be seen in his style with its archaisms or provincialisms, its glowing imagery and its passionate temper</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a scholar with an excellent education</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote at least three books in Greek</span>
				<span class='text'>In them he refers to himself, but none of these are extant</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to church tradition, he was raised in [[Carthage]]&lt;ref name =&quot;Oxford&quot;&gt;Cross, F</span>

				<span class='text'>2005&lt;/ref&gt; and was thought to be the son of a Roman centurion; Tertullian has been claimed to be a trained lawyer, and an ordained priest</span>
				<span class='text'>These assertions rely on the accounts of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church History]]'', II, ii</span>
				<span class='text'>4, and [[Jerome]]'s ''[[De Viris Illustribus (Jerome)|De viris illustribus]]'' (On famous men) chapter 53</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See introduction to [[Timothy Barnes]], ''Tertullian: A Historical and Literary Study''; however Barnes retracted some of his positions in the 1985 revised edition&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome]] claimed that Tertullian's father held the position of ''centurio proconsularis'' (&quot;aide-de-camp&quot;) in the [[Roman army]] in Africa</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome]], 'Chronicon' 16</span>
				<span class='text'>3-4&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear whether any such position in the Roman military ever existed</span>

				<span class='text'>Might derive from the prior reference---&gt;Further, Tertullian has been thought to be a lawyer based on his use of legal analogies and an identification of him with the jurist Tertullianus, who is quoted in the ''[[Pandects]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Tertullian used a knowledge of Roman law in his writings, his legal knowledge does not demonstrably exceed that of what could be expected from a sufficient Roman education</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Barnes, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>24, 27&lt;/ref&gt; The writings of Tertullianus, a lawyer of the same ''[[cognomen]],'' exist only in fragments and do not denote a Christian authorship</span>
				<span class='text'>(Tertullianus was misidentified only much later with the Christian Tertullian by church historians</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>23&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, any notion of Tertullian being a priest is also questionable</span>
				<span class='text'>In his extant writings, he never describes himself as ordained&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, pg</span>
				<span class='text'>11&lt;/ref&gt; in the church and seems to place himself among the laity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, De Exhortatione Castitatis 7</span>
				<span class='text'> and De Monogamia 12</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;His conversion to Christianity perhaps took place about 197‚Äì198 (cf</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Adolf Harnack]], [[Bonwetsch]], and others), but its immediate antecedents are unknown except as they are conjectured from his writings</span>
				<span class='text'>The event must have been sudden and decisive, transforming at once his own personality</span>
				<span class='text'>He said of himself that he could not imagine a truly Christian life without such a conscious breach, a radical act of conversion: &quot;Christians are made, not born&quot; (''Apol</span>
				<span class='text'>', xviii)</span>
				<span class='text'>wo books addressed to his wife confirm that he was married to a Christian wife</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Book Written to His Wife|url=http://www</span>
				<span class='text'>ewadvent</span>
				<span class='text'>rg/fathers/0404</span>
				<span class='text'>tm}}&lt;/ref&gt;In middle life (about 207), he was attracted to the &quot;New Prophecy&quot; of [[Montanism]], and seems to have split from the mainstream church</span>
				<span class='text'>In the time of [[Augustine]], a group of &quot;Tertullianists&quot; still had a basilica in Carthage which, within that same period, passed to the orthodox Church</span>
				<span class='text'>It is unclear whether the name was merely another for the Montanists&lt;ref&gt;The passage in ''Praedestinatus'' describing the Tertullianists suggests that this might have been the case, as the Tertullianist minister obtains the use of a church in Rome on the grounds that the martyrs to whom it was dedicated were Montanists</span>
				<span class='text'>But the passage is very condensed and ambiguous</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; or that this means Tertullian later split with the Montanists and founded his own group</span>
				<span class='text'>erome&lt;ref&gt;''De viris illustribus'' 53&lt;/ref&gt; says that Tertullian lived to a great age, but there is no reliable source attesting to his survival beyond the estimated year 225 AD</span>
				<span class='text'>In spite of his schism from the Church, he continued to write against heresy, especially [[Gnosticism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, by the doctrinal works he published, Tertullian became the teacher of [[Cyprian]] and the predecessor of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], who, in turn, became the chief founder of Latin theology</span>
				<span class='text'>= Writings ===== General character ===Thirty-one works are extant, together with fragments of more</span>
				<span class='text'>Some fifteen works in Latin or Greek are lost, some as recently as the 9th century (''De Paradiso, De superstitione saeculi, De carne et anima'' were all extant in the now damaged ''[[Codex Agobardinus]]'' in 814 AD)</span>
				<span class='text'>Tertullian's writings cover the whole theological field of the time‚Äî[[apologetics]] against paganism and Judaism, [[polemic]]s, polity, discipline, and morals, or the whole reorganization of human life on a Christian basis; they gave a picture of the religious life and thought of the time which is of the greatest interest to the church historian</span>
				<span class='text'>== Chronology and contents ===The chronology of these writings is difficult to fix with certainty</span>
				<span class='text'>It is in part determined by the [[Montanism|Montanistic]] views that are set forth in some of them, by the author's own allusions to ''this'' writing, or ''that,'' as antedating others (cf</span>
				<span class='text'>Harnack, ''Litteratur'' ii</span>
				<span class='text'>60‚Äì262), and by definite historic data (e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> the reference to the death of [[Septimius Severus]], ''Ad Scapulam'', iv)</span>
				<span class='text'>In his work against [[Marcion]], which he calls his third composition on the Marcionite heresy, he gives its date as the fifteenth year of the reign of Severus (''Adv</span>
				<span class='text'>Marcionem'', i</span>
				<span class='text'>, 15)‚Äîwhich would be approximately the year 208</span>
				<span class='text'>he writings may be divided with reference to the two periods of Tertullian's Christian activity, the Catholic and the Montanist (cf</span>
				<span class='text'>Harnack, ii</span>
				<span class='text'>62 sqq</span>
				<span class='text'>, or according to their subject-matter</span>
				<span class='text'>The object of the former mode of division is to show, if possible, the change of views Tertullian's mind underwent</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the latter mode, which is of a more practical interest, the writings fall into two groups</span>
				<span class='text'>Apologetic and polemic writings, like ''[[Apologeticus]]'', ''De testimonio animae'', the [[anti-Judaism|anti-Jewish]] ''[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Apologetic/An Answer to the Jews|De Adversus Iudaeos]]'', ''Adv</span>
				<span class='text'>Marcionem'', ''Adv</span>
				<span class='text'>Praxeam'', ''Adv</span>
				<span class='text'>Hermogenem'', ''De praescriptione hereticorum'', and ''Scorpiace'' were written to counteract [[Gnosticism]] and other religious or philosophical doctrines</span>
				<span class='text'>The other group consists of practical and disciplinary writings, e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> ''De monogamia'', ''Ad uxorem'', ''De virginibus velandis'', ''De cultu feminarum'', ''De patientia'', ''De pudicitia'', ''De oratione'', and ''Ad martyras''</span>
				<span class='text'>mong his apologetic writings, the ''Apologeticus,'' addressed to the Roman magistrates, is a most pungent defense of Christianity and the Christians against the reproaches of the pagans, and an important legacy of the ancient Church, proclaiming the principle of [[freedom of religion]] as an inalienable human right and demands a fair trial for Christians before they are condemned to death</span>
				<span class='text'>ertullian was the first to disprove such charges as that the Christians sacrificed infants at the [[Eucharist|celebration of the Lord's Supper]] and committed incest</span>
				<span class='text'>He pointed to the commission of such crimes in the pagan world and then proved by the testimony of [[Pliny the Younger]] that Christians pledged themselves not to commit murder, adultery, or other crimes</span>
				<span class='text'>He adduced also the inhumanity of pagan customs such as feeding the flesh of gladiators to beasts</span>
				<span class='text'>He argued that the gods have no existence and thus there is no pagan religion against which Christians may offend</span>
				<span class='text'>Christians do not engage in the foolish worship of the emperors</span>
				<span class='text'>They do better: they pray for them</span>
				<span class='text'>Christians can afford to be put to torture and to death, and the more they are cast down the more they grow; &quot;the blood of the [[martyr]]s is seed&quot; (''[[Apologeticus|Apologeticum]]'', 50)</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ''De Praescriptione'' he develops as its fundamental idea that, in a dispute between the Church and a separating party, the whole [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] lies with the latter, as the Church, in possession of the unbroken tradition, is by its very existence a guarantee of its truth</span>
				<span class='text'>he five books against Marcion, written in 207 or 208, are the most comprehensive and elaborate of his polemical works, invaluable for gauging the early Christian view of Gnosticism</span>
				<span class='text'>Of the moral and ascetic treatises, the ''De patientia'' and ''[[De spectaculis]]'' are among the most interesting, and the ''De pudicitia'' and ''De virginibus velandis'' among the most characteristic</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=January 2010}}Tertullian has been identified by Jo Ann McNamara as the person who originally invested the consecrated virgin as the ‚Äúbride of Christ‚Äù which helped to bring the independent virgin under patriarchal rule</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bitel 2008, p 17&quot;&gt;Bitel 2008, p 17&lt;/ref&gt;== Theology ===== General character ==={{OR section|date=August 2013}}Though thoroughly conversant with the Greek theology, Tertullian remained independent of its metaphysical speculations</span>
				<span class='text'>He had learned from the Greek apologies, and offered a direct contrast to [[Origen of Alexandria]], who drew many of his theories regarding creation from [[Middle Platonism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Tertullian, the prince of realists and practical theologian{{POV-inline|reason=not worthy WP!!|date=April 2013}}, carried his [[philosophical realism|realism]] to the verge of [[materialism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This is evident from his ascription to God of corporeity and his acceptance of the [[Traducianism|traducian theory]] of the origin of the soul</span>
				<span class='text'>He despised Greek philosophy, and, far from looking at [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and other Greek thinkers whom he quotes as forerunners of Christ and the Gospel, he pronounces them the patriarchal forefathers of the heretics (''De anima'', iii</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>He held up to scorn their inconsistency when he referred to the fact that [[Socrates]] in dying ordered a cock to be sacrificed to [[Aesculapius]] (''De anima'', i)</span>
				<span class='text'>Tertullian always wrote under stress of a felt necessity</span>
				<span class='text'>He was never so happy as when he had opponents like [[Marcion]] and [[Praxeas]], and, however abstract the ideas may be which he treated, he was always moved by practical considerations to make his case clear and irresistible</span>
				<span class='text'>It was partly this element which gave to his writings a formative influence upon the theology of the post-Nicene period in the West and has rendered them fresh reading to this day</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he was by nature a polemicist no mention is made of his name by other authors during the 3rd century</span>
				<span class='text'>Lactantius at the opening of the 4th century is the first to do so: Augustine, however, treats him with respect</span>
				<span class='text'>Cyprian, Tertullian's North African compatriot, though nowhere mentioning his name, was well read in his writings, according to Cyprian's secretary in a letter to Jerome</span>
				<span class='text'>== Specific teachings ===Tertullian's main doctrinal teachings are as follows:# The soul was not preexistent, as Plato affirmed, nor subject to [[metempsychosis]] or [[reincarnation]], as the [[Pythagoreans]] held</span>
				<span class='text'>In each individual it is a new product, proceeding equally with the body from the parents, and not created later and associated with the body (''De anima'', xxvii)</span>
				<span class='text'>This position is called [[traducianism]] in opposition to '[[Creationism (soul)|creationism]]', or the idea that each soul is a fresh creation of God</span>
				<span class='text'># The soul's sinfulness is easily explained by its [[traducian]] origin (''De anima'', xxxix)</span>
				<span class='text'>It is in bondage to [[Satan]] (whose works it renounces in baptism), but has seeds of good (''De anima'', xli), and when awakened, it passes to health and at once calls upon God (''Apol</span>
				<span class='text'>', xvii</span>
				<span class='text'> and is naturally Christian</span>
				<span class='text'>It exists in all men alike; it is a culprit and yet an unconscious witness by its impulse to worship, its fear of demons, and its musings on death to the power, benignity, and judgment of God as revealed in the Christian's Scriptures (''De testimonio,'' v-vi)</span>
				<span class='text'> God, who made the world out of nothing through his Son, the Word, has corporeity though he is a spirit (''De praescriptione'', vii</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Adv</span>
				<span class='text'>Praxeam,'' vii</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>However Tertullian used 'corporeal' only in the [[stoicism|Stoic]] sense, to mean something with actual existence, rather than the later idea of flesh</span>
				<span class='text'>In the statement of the [[Trinity]], Tertullian was a forerunner of the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene doctrine]], approaching the subject from the standpoint of the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos doctrine]], though he did not state the immanent Trinity</span>
				<span class='text'>His use of ''trinitas'' (Latin: 'Threeness') emphasised the manifold character of God</span>
				<span class='text'>In his treatise against Praxeas, who taught [[patripassianism]] in Rome, he used the words, &quot;Trinity and economy, persons and substance</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The Son is distinct from the Father, and the Spirit from both the Father and the Son (''Adv</span>
				<span class='text'>Praxeam,'' xxv)</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;These three are one substance, not one person; and it is said, 'I and my Father are one' in respect not of the singularity of number but the unity of the substance</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The very names &quot;Father&quot; and &quot;Son&quot; indicate the distinction of personality</span>
				<span class='text'>The Father is one, the Son is one, and the Spirit is one (''Adv</span>
				<span class='text'>Praxeam'', ix)</span>
				<span class='text'>As regards the question whether the Son was coeternal with the Father, many believe that Tertullian did not teach that</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' comments that for Tertullian, &quot;There was a time when there was no Son and no sin, when God was neither Father nor Judge</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Similarly [[J</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Kelly]] has stated: &quot;Tertullian followed the Apologists in dating His ‚Äúperfect generation&quot; from His extrapolation for the work of creation; prior to that moment God could not strictly be said to have had a Son, while after it the term ‚ÄúFather&quot;, which for earlier theologians generally connoted God as author of reality, began to acquire the specialized meaning of Father and Son</span>

				<span class='text'>Kelly, ''Early Christian Doctrines,'' Continual International Publishing Book, c1960, 2000, p</span>
				<span class='text'>112&lt;/ref&gt; As regards the subjects of [[subordinationism|subordination]] of the Son to the Father, the ''New Catholic Encyclopedia'' has commented: &quot;In not a few areas of theology, Tertullian‚Äôs views are, of course, completely unacceptable</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, for example, his teaching on the Trinity reveals a subordination of Son to Father that in the later crass form of [[Arianism]] the Church rejected as heretical</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;W</span>
				<span class='text'>Le Saint, &quot;Tertullian,&quot; ''The New Catholic Encyclopedia,'' Thompson Gale, 2003, Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>13, p</span>
				<span class='text'>837</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;# In [[soteriology]], Tertullian does not dogmatize; he prefers to keep silence at the mystery of the cross (''De Patientia'', iii)</span>
				<span class='text'>The sufferings of Christ's life as well as of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] are efficacious to redemption</span>
				<span class='text'>In the water of [[baptism]], which (upon a partial quotation of John 3:5) is made necessary (''De baptismo'', vi</span>
				<span class='text'>, humans are born again; the baptized does not receive the [[Holy Spirit]] in the water, but is prepared for the Holy Spirit</span>
				<span class='text'>Humans are little fishes‚Äîafter the example of the ''[[ichthys]]'', fish, Jesus Christ‚Äîare born in water (''De baptismo'', i)</span>
				<span class='text'>n discussing whether sins committed subsequent to baptism may be forgiven, Tertullian calls baptism and [[penance]] &quot;two planks&quot; on which the sinner may be saved from shipwreck‚Äîlanguage which he gave to the Church (''De penitentia'', xii)</span>
				<span class='text'> With reference to the '[[rule of faith]]', it may be said that Tertullian is constantly using this expression, and by it means ''now'' the authoritative tradition handed down in the Church, ''now'' the Scriptures themselves, and, ''perhaps'', a definite doctrinal formula</span>
				<span class='text'>While he nowhere gives a list of the books of Scripture, he divides them into two parts and calls them the ''instrumentum '' and ''testamentum'' (''Adv</span>
				<span class='text'>Marcionem'', iv</span>
				<span class='text'>)</span>
				<span class='text'>He distinguishes between the [[four Gospels]] and insists upon their apostolic origin as accrediting their authority (''De praescriptione'', xxxvi; ''Adv</span>
				<span class='text'>Marcionem'', iv</span>
				<span class='text'>‚Äì5); in trying to account for Marcion's treatment of the Lucan Gospel and the Pauline writings he sarcastically queries whether the &quot;shipmaster from Pontus&quot; (Marcion) had ever been guilty of taking on contraband goods or tampering with them after they were aboard (''Adv</span>
				<span class='text'>Marcionem'', v</span>
				<span class='text'>)</span>
				<span class='text'>The Scripture, the rule of faith, is for him fixed and authoritative (''De corona'', iii-iv)</span>
				<span class='text'>As opposed to the pagan writings they are divine (''De testimonio animae'', vi)</span>
				<span class='text'>They contain all truth (''De praescriptione'', vii, xiv) and from them the Church drinks (''potat'') her faith (''Adv</span>
				<span class='text'>Praxeam'', xiii)</span>
				<span class='text'>The prophets were older than the Greek philosophers and their authority is accredited by the fulfilment of their predictions (''Apol</span>
				<span class='text'>', xix-xx)</span>
				<span class='text'>The Scriptures and the teachings of philosophy are incompatible, insofar as the latter are the origins of sub-Christian heresies</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;What has [[Athens]] to do with [[Jerusalem]]?&quot; he exclaims, &quot;or the Academy with the Church?&quot; (''De praescriptione'', vii)</span>
				<span class='text'>Philosophy as pop-paganism is a work of demons (''De anima'', i); the Scriptures contain the wisdom of heaven</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Tertullian was not averse to using the technical methods of [[Stoicism]] to discuss a problem (''De anima'')</span>
				<span class='text'>The rule of faith, however, seems to be also applied by Tertullian to some distinct formula of doctrine, and he gives a succinct statement of the Christian faith under this term (''De praescriptione'', xiii)</span>
				<span class='text'> Tertullian was a defender of the necessity of apostolicity</span>
				<span class='text'>In his ''Prescription Against Heretics'', he explicitly challenges heretics to produce evidence of the [[apostolic succession]] of their communities</span>

				<span class='text'>For this is the manner in which the apostolic churches transmit their registers: as the [[Metropolis of Smyrna|church of Smyrna]], which records that [[Polycarp]] was placed therein by [[John the Apostle|John]]; as also the church of Rome, which makes [[Pope Clement I|Clement]] to have been ordained in like manner by [[Saint Peter|Peter]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In exactly the same way the other churches likewise exhibit (their several worthies), whom, as having been appointed to their episcopal places by apostles, they regard as transmitters of the apostolic seed</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;# [[Fornication|Fornicators]] and [[Murder]]ers should never be admitted into the church under any circumstances</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''De pudicitia'', Tertullian condemns Pope [[Callixtus I]] for allowing such people in when they show repentance</span>
				<span class='text'>==Eschatology===;The Resurrection at the Second ComingTertullian was a [[Premillennialism|premillennialist]], affirming a literal resurrection at the second advent of Jesus at the end of the world, not at death</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=255-256}};Jesus the Stone that strike is Image</span>
				<span class='text'>Concerning the image prophecy of [[Daniel 2]], Tertullian identified Jesus, at his second advent, as the stone cut out of a mountain that strikes and destroys the image of ‚Äúsecular kingdoms</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù He compares this with [[Daniel 7]], 'Behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days; and they brought Him before Him, and there was given Him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages should serve Him</span>
				<span class='text'>His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away; and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed</span>

				<span class='text'>3, p</span>
				<span class='text'>326&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=256}};Antichrist = Beast = Man of Sin Near Like [[Irenaeus]], Tertullian equated the [[Antichrist]] with the ‚Äò‚ÄôMan of Sin‚Äô‚Äô and the ‚Äò‚ÄôBeast‚Äô‚Äô</span>
				<span class='text'>He expected a specific Antichrist just before the resurrection, as a persecutor of the church, under whom a second company of martyrs will be slain</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike Irenaeus, however, Tertullian does not consider the Antichrist to be a Jew sitting in a Jewish temple at Jerusalem</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather, the Antichrist comes out of the church</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=257}};Rome figured as BabylonTertullian applied the Biblical figure of [[Babylon (New Testament)|Babylon]] to the city of Rome and her domination</span>
				<span class='text'>He portrayed Rome as drunk with the blood of martyred saints</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=258}};Order of last Days EventsThe order of last day events, according to Tertullian, are the plagues, Babylon's doom, Antichrist's warfare on the saints, the devil cast into the bottomless pit, the Advent, the resurrection of the saints, the Judgment, and the Second Resurrection, with the harvest at the end of the World; and the sixth seal extending to the final dissolution of the earth and sky, including the stars</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=258-259}};Millennium follows Resurrection of Righteous DeadTertullian maintained that the thousand years of Revelation will follow the resurrection of the righteous dead on the earth with the [[New Jerusalem]], proceeding the eternity of heaven</span>
				<span class='text'>The earth is destroyed after the one thousand years and the saints moved to the kingdom of heaven</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfn|Froom|1950|pp=259-260}};Seventy Weeks Fulfilled by First AdventTertullian contended that Daniel's [[Prophecy of Seventy Weeks|seventy weeks]] foretold the time of Christ's incarnation and death</span>
				<span class='text'>He started the seventy weeks from the first year of [[Darius the Mede|Darius]], and continued to Jerusalem's destruction by the Romans under the command of Titus, fully completing the vision and prophecy</span>
				<span class='text'> It is sealed by the advent of Christ, which he places at the end of the sixty-two and one-half weeks</span>
				<span class='text'>{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=260-261}}== Moral principles =={{OR section|date=July 2015}}Tertullian was a determined advocate of strict discipline and an austere code of practise, and like many of the African fathers, one of the leading representatives of the rigorist element in the early Church</span>
				<span class='text'>These views may have led him to adopt [[Montanism]] with its ascetic [[rigor]] and its belief in [[chiliasm]] and the continuance of the prophetic gifts</span>
				<span class='text'>In his writings on public amusements, the veiling of virgins, the conduct of women, and the like, he gives expression to these views</span>
				<span class='text'>n the principle that we should not look at or listen to what we have no right to practise, and that polluted things, seen and touched, pollute (''De spectaculis'', viii, xvii), he declared a Christian should abstain from the theater and the amphitheater</span>
				<span class='text'>There pagan religious rites were applied and the names of pagan divinities invoked; there the precepts of modesty, purity, and humanity were ignored or set aside, and there no place was offered to the onlookers for the cultivation of the Christian graces</span>
				<span class='text'>Women should put aside their gold and precious stones as ornaments,&lt;ref&gt;''De cultu'', v-vi&lt;/ref&gt; and virgins should conform to the law of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Paul for women and keep themselves strictly veiled (''De virginibus velandis'')</span>
				<span class='text'>He praised the unmarried state as the highest (''De monogamia'', xvii; ''Ad uxorem'', i</span>
				<span class='text'>) and called upon Christians not to allow themselves to be excelled in the virtue of celibacy by [[Vestal Virgin]]s and Egyptian priests</span>
				<span class='text'>He even labeled second marriage a species of adultery (''De exhortationis castitatis'', ix), but this directly contradicted the Epistles of the [[Apostle Paul]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Tertullian‚Äôs resolve to never marry again and that no one else should marry eventually led to his break with Rome because the orthodox church refused to follow him in this resolve</span>
				<span class='text'>He, instead, favored the Montanist sect where they also condemned second marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Bitel 2008, p</span>
				<span class='text'>21&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for Tertullian‚Äôs disdain for marriage was his belief about the transformation that awaited a married couple</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed that marital relations coarsened the body and the soul and would dull their spiritual senses and avert the Holy Spirit since husband and wife became one flesh once married</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bitel 2008, p 17&quot;/&gt;His moral vigour and the service he provided as an ingenious and intrepid defender of the Christian religion were, for him, down to his view of Christianity as first and chiefly an experience of the heart</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2015}}Because of his later affiliation with Montanism, he, like the influential Alexandrian theologian, [[Origen of Alexandria|Origen]], has failed to receive the elevation of official [[canonization]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=July 2015}}Tertullian is sometimes criticized for being [[misogynistic]], on the basis of the contents of his ''De Cultu Feminarum,'' section I</span>
				<span class='text'>, part 2 (trans</span>
				<span class='text'>C</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Marx): &quot;Do you not know that you are [[Eve]]? The judgment of God upon this sex lives on in this age; therefore, necessarily the guilt should live on also</span>
				<span class='text'>You are the gateway of the devil; you are the one who unseals the curse of that tree, and you are the first one to turn your back on the divine law; you are the one who persuaded him whom the devil was not capable of corrupting; you easily destroyed the image of God, [[Adam]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of what you deserve, that is, death, even the Son of God had to die</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Tertullian had a radical view on the cosmos</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed that heaven and earth intersected at many points and that it was possible for there to be sexual relations with supernatural beings</span>
