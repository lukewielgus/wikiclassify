				<span class='text'>9  Later that year he moved to New York City and began a career in magazine illustration and advertising</span>
				<span class='text'>Career During the 1950s Warhol gained fame for his whimsical ink drawings of shoe advertisements</span>
				<span class='text'>These were done in a loose blotted ink style and figured in some of his earliest showings at the  in New York</span>
				<span class='text'>With the concurrent rapid expansion of the record industry and the introduction of the vinyl record Hi Fi and stereophonic recordings  hired Warhol along with another freelance artist Sid Maurer to design album covers and promotional materials</span>
				<span class='text'>Warhol was an early adopter of the  printmaking process as a technique for making paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>His earliest silkscreening in painting involved hand drawn images though this soon progressed to the use of photographically derived silkscreening in paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>Prior to entering the field of fine art Warhols commercial art background also involved innovative techniques for image making that were somewhat related to printmaking techniques</span>
				<span class='text'>When rendering commercial objects for advertising Warhol devised a technique that resulted in a characteristic image</span>
				<span class='text'>His imagery used in advertising was often executed by means of applying ink to paper and then blotting the ink while still wet</span>
				<span class='text'>This was akin to a  process on the most rudimentary scale</span>
				<span class='text'>Warhols work both as a commercial artist and later a fine artist displays a casual approach to image making in which chance plays a role and mistakes and unintentional marks are tolerated</span>
				<span class='text'>The resulting imagery in both Warhols commercial art and later in his fine art endeavors is often replete with imperfection‚Äîsmudges and smears can often be found</span>

				<span class='text'>name warholfoundation history  Works By the beginning of the 1960s Warhol had become a very successful commercial illustrator</span>
				<span class='text'>His detailed and elegant drawings for I</span>
				<span class='text'>Miller shoes were particularly popular</span>
				<span class='text'>They consisted mainly of blotted ink drawings or s a technique which he applied in much of his early art</span>
				<span class='text'>Although many artists of this period worked in commercial art most did so discreetly</span>
				<span class='text'>Warhol was so successful however that his profile as an illustrator seemed to undermine his efforts to be taken seriously as an artist</span>
				<span class='text'>was an experimental form that several artists were independently adopting some of these pioneers such as  would later become synonymous with the movement</span>
				<span class='text'>Warhol who would become famous as the Pope of Pop turned to this new style where popular subjects could be part of the artists palette</span>
				<span class='text'>His early paintings show images taken from  and advertisements hand painted with paint drips</span>
				<span class='text'>Marilyn Monroe was a pop art painting that Warhol had done and it was very popular</span>
				<span class='text'>Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists such as </span>

				<span class='text'> Eventually Warhol pared his image vocabulary down to the icon itself‚Äîto brand names celebrities dollar signs‚Äîand removed all traces of the artists hand in the production of his paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>o him part of defining a niche was defining his subject matter</span>
				<span class='text'>Cartoons were already being used by Lichtenstein typography by  and so on Warhol wanted a distinguishing subject</span>
				<span class='text'>His friends suggested he should paint the things he loved the most</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the gallerist Muriel Latow who came up with the ideas for both the soup cans and Warhols dollar paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>On November 23 1961 Warhol wrote Latow a check for 50 which according to the 2009 Warhol biography Pop The Genius of Warhol was payment for coming up with the idea of the soup cans as subject matter</span>
				<span class='text'>For his first major exhibition Warhol painted his famous cans of Campbells Soup which he claimed to have had for lunch for most of his life</span>

				<span class='text'>From these beginnings he developed his later style and subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead of working on a signature subject matter as he started out to do he worked more and more on a signature style slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process</span>

				<span class='text'>It was indicated that Warhol spent only a total of 23 minutes to paint the entire car</span>
				<span class='text'>Warhol produced both comic and serious works his subject could be a soup can or an electric chair</span>
				<span class='text'>Warhol used the same techniques‚Äîsilkscreens reproduced serially and often painted with bright colors‚Äîwhether he painted celebrities everyday objects or images of suicide car crashes and disasters as in the 1962‚Äì1963 Death and Disaster series</span>
				<span class='text'>The Death and Disaster paintings included Red Car Crash Purple Jumping Man and Orange Disaster</span>
