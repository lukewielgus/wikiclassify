				<span class='text'>His detailed and elegant drawings for I</span>
				<span class='text'>Miller shoes were particularly popular</span>
				<span class='text'>They consisted mainly of &quot;blotted ink&quot; drawings (or [[monoprint]]s), a technique which he applied in much of his early art</span>
				<span class='text'>Although many artists of this period worked in commercial art, most did so discreetly</span>
				<span class='text'>Warhol was so successful, however, that his profile as an illustrator seemed to undermine his efforts to be taken seriously as an artist</span>
				<span class='text'>[Pop art]] was an experimental form that several artists were independently adopting; some of these pioneers, such as [[Roy Lichtenstein]], would later become synonymous with the movement</span>
				<span class='text'>Warhol, who would become famous as the &quot;Pope of Pop&quot;, turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's palette</span>
				<span class='text'>His early paintings show images taken from [[cartoons]] and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips</span>
				<span class='text'>Marilyn Monroe was a pop art painting that Warhol had done and it was very popular</span>
				<span class='text'>Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists (such as [[Willem de Kooning]])</span>
				<span class='text'>Warhol's first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961, serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bronwit Teller's window display</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the same stage his Pop Art contemporaries [[Jasper Johns]], [[James Rosenquist]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] had also once graced</span>

				<span class='text'>8</span>
				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-8357-1733-X</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Warhol pared his image vocabulary down to the icon itselfâ€”to brand names, celebrities, dollar signsâ€”and removed all traces of the artist's &quot;hand&quot; in the production of his paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>o him, part of defining a niche was defining his subject matter</span>
				<span class='text'>Cartoons were already being used by Lichtenstein, typography by [[Jasper Johns]], and so on; Warhol wanted a distinguishing subject</span>
				<span class='text'>His friends suggested he should paint the things he loved the most</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the gallerist Muriel Latow who came up with the ideas for both the soup cans and Warhol's dollar paintings</span>
				<span class='text'>On November 23, 1961 Warhol wrote Latow a check for $50 which, according to the 2009 Warhol biography, ''Pop, The Genius of Warhol'', was payment for coming up with the idea of the soup cans as subject matter</span>

				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=August 2013}}He loved [[celebrity|celebrities]], so he painted them as well</span>
				<span class='text'>From these beginnings he developed his later style and subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead of working on a signature subject matter, as he started out to do, he worked more and more on a signature style, slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process</span>
				<span class='text'>Warhol frequently used [[silk-screen]]ing; his later drawings were traced from slide projections</span>
				<span class='text'>At the height of his fame as a painter, Warhol had several assistants who produced his silk-screen multiples, following his directions to make different versions and variations</span>

				<span class='text'>8&lt;/ref&gt;In 1979, Warhol was commissioned by BMW to paint a Group 4 race version of the then elite supercar [[BMW M1]] for the fourth installment in the [[BMW Art Car Project]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike the three artists before him, Warhol declined the use of a small scale practice model, instead opting to immediately paint directly onto the full scale automobile</span>
				<span class='text'>It was indicated that Warhol spent only a total of 23 minutes to paint the entire car</span>

				<span class='text'>Lou Reed wrote the song &quot;Andy's Chest&quot;, about [[Valerie Solanas]], the woman who shot Warhol, in 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>He recorded it with the Velvet Underground, and this version was released on the ''[[VU (album)|VU]]'' album in 1985</span>
				<span class='text'>Bowie would later play Warhol in the 1996 movie, ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Bowie recalled how meeting Warhol in real life helped him in the role, and recounted his early meetings with him:{{quote|I met him a couple of times, but we seldom shared more than platitudes</span>
				<span class='text'>The first time we saw each other an awkward silence fell till he remarked my bright yellow shoes and started talking enthusiastically</span>
				<span class='text'>He wanted to be very superficial</span>
				<span class='text'>And seemingly emotionless, indifferent, just like a dead fish</span>
				<span class='text'>Lou Reed described him most profoundly when he once told me they should bring a doll of Andy on the market: a doll that you wind up and doesn't do anything</span>
				<span class='text'>But I managed to observe him well, and that was a helping hand for the film ''[Basquiat'']</span>
				<span class='text'>â€¦ We borrowed his clothes from the museum in Pittsburgh, and they were intact, unwashed</span>
				<span class='text'>Even the pockets weren't emptied: they contained pancake, white, deadly pale ''{{abbr|fond de teint|foundation}}'' which Andy always smeared on his face, a check torn in pieces, someone's address, lots of homeopathic pills and a wig</span>
				<span class='text'>Andy always wore those silver wigs, but he never admitted it were wigs</span>
				<span class='text'>One of his hairdressers has told me lately that he had his wigs regularly cut, like it were real hair</span>
