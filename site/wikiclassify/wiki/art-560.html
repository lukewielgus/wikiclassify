				<span class='text'>Guthrie was paid $180 a week, an impressive salary in 1940</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was finally making enough money to send regular payments back to Mary</span>
				<span class='text'>He also brought her and the children to New York, where the family lived briefly in an apartment on [[Central Park West]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The reunion represented Woody's desire to be a better father and husband</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====Pacific Northwest====In May 1941, after a brief stay in Los Angeles, Guthrie moved the family north to Oregon on the promise of a job</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Gunther von Fritsch]] was directing a documentary about the [[Bonneville Power Administration]]'s construction of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]] on the [[Columbia River]], and needed a narrator</span>
				<span class='text'>Alan Lomax had recommended Guthrie to narrate the film and sing songs onscreen</span>
				<span class='text'>The original project was expected to take 12 months, but as filmmakers became worried about casting such a political figure, they minimized Guthrie's role</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] hired him for one month to write songs about the [[Columbia River]] and the construction of the federal dams for the documentary's soundtrack</span>
				<span class='text'> Guthrie toured the Columbia River and the Pacific Northwest</span>
				<span class='text'>Guthrie said he &quot;couldn't believe it, it's a paradise&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>209</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; which appeared to inspire him creatively</span>
				<span class='text'>In one month Guthrie wrote 26 songs, including three of his most famous: &quot;[[Roll On, Columbia, Roll On]]&quot;, &quot;[[Pastures of Plenty]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Grand Coulee Dam (song)|Grand Coulee Dam]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;195, 196, 202, 205, 212&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving songs were released as ''[[The Columbia River Collection (Woody Guthrie Album)|Columbia River Songs]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The film &quot;Columbia&quot; was not completed until 1949 (see below)</span>
				<span class='text'>At the conclusion of the month in Oregon and Washington, Guthrie wanted to return to New York</span>
				<span class='text'>Tired of the continual uprooting, Mary Guthrie told him to go without her and the children</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>213</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Although Guthrie would see Mary again, once on a tour through Los Angeles with the Almanac Singers, it was essentially the end of their marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>Divorce was difficult, since Mary was a member of the [[Catholic Church]], but she reluctantly agreed in December 1943</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|Woody Guthrie, 1943]]====Almanac Singers===={{Main|Almanac Singers}}Following the conclusion of his work in the Northwest, Guthrie corresponded with [[Pete Seeger]] about Seeger's newly formed folk-protest group, the [[Almanac Singers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Guthrie returned to New York with plans to tour the country as a member of the group</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>92-93,195–231&lt;/ref&gt; The singers originally worked out of a loft in New York City hosting regular concerts called &quot;[[hootenanny]]s&quot;, a word Pete and Woody had picked up in their cross-country travels</span>
				<span class='text'>The singers eventually outgrew the space and moved into the cooperative Almanac House in [[Greenwich Village]]</span>
				<span class='text'>nitially Guthrie helped write and sing what the Almanac Singers termed &quot;peace&quot; songs; while the Nazi-Soviet Pact was in effect, until Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Communist line was that [[World War II]] was a capitalist fraud</span>
				<span class='text'>After Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union, the group wrote anti-fascist songs</span>
				<span class='text'>The members of the Almanac Singers and residents of the Almanac House were a loosely defined group of musicians, though the &quot;core&quot; members included Guthrie, [[Pete Seeger]], [[Millard Lampell]] and [[Lee Hays]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In keeping with common socialist ideals, meals, chores and rent at the Almanac House were shared</span>
				<span class='text'>The Sunday hootenannys were good opportunities to collect donation money for rent</span>
				<span class='text'>Songs written in the Almanac House had shared songwriting credits among all the members, although in the case of &quot;[[Union Maid]]&quot;, members would later state that Guthrie wrote the song, ensuring that his children would receive residuals</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;220</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In the Almanac House, Guthrie added authenticity to their work, since he was a &quot;real&quot; working-class Oklahoman</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;There was the heart of America personified in Woody </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>And for a New York Left that was primarily Jewish, first or second generation American, and was desperately trying to get Americanized, I think a figure like Woody was of great, great importance&quot;, a friend of the group, [[Irwin Silber]], would say</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;216</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Woody routinely emphasized his working-class image, rejected songs he felt were not in the country blues vein he was familiar with, and rarely contributed to household chores</span>
				<span class='text'>House member [[Sis Cunningham|Agnes &quot;Sis&quot; Cunningham]], another Okie, would later recall that Woody, &quot;loved people to think of him as a real working class person and not an intellectual&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;231</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Guthrie contributed songwriting and authenticity in much the same capacity for Pete Seeger's post-Almanac Singers project ''[[People's Songs]]'', a newsletter and booking organization for labor singers, founded in 1945</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;====''Bound for Glory''====Guthrie was a prolific writer, penning thousands of pages of unpublished poems and prose, many written while living in New York City</span>
				<span class='text'>After a recording session with Alan Lomax, Lomax suggested Guthrie write an autobiography</span>
				<span class='text'> Lomax thought Guthrie's descriptions of growing up were some of the best accounts he had read of American childhood</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;200,&amp;nbsp;201</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; During this time Guthrie met [[Marjorie Mazia]], a dancer in New York who would become his second wife</span>
				<span class='text'>Mazia was an instructor at the prestigious [[Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance|Martha Graham Dance School]], where she was assisting [[Sophie Maslow]] with her piece ''Folksay''</span>
				<span class='text'>Based on the folklore and poetry collected by [[Carl Sandburg]], ''Folksay'' included the adaptation of some of Guthrie's ''Dust Bowl Ballads'' for the dance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;200</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Guthrie continued to write songs and began work on his autobiography</span>
				<span class='text'>The end product, [[Bound for Glory (book)|''Bound for Glory'']], was completed with the patient editing assistance of Mazia and was first published by E</span>

				<span class='text'> Over the next few years, he recorded &quot;[[Worried Man Blues]]&quot;, along with [[Woody Guthrie discography#1944 &amp; 1945, The Asch Recordings|hundreds of other songs]]</span>

				<span class='text'>===World War II years====Guthrie believed performing his anti-fascist songs and poems at home was the best use of his talents; Guthrie lobbied the United States Army to accept him as a USO performer instead of conscripting him as a soldier in the draft</span>
				<span class='text'>When Guthrie's attempts failed, his friends [[Cisco Houston]] and Jim Longhi pressured Guthrie to join the [[United States Merchant Marine|U</span>

				<span class='text'>Travis'', SS ''William Floyd'', and SS ''Sea Porpoise''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After his discharge, they moved into a house on Mermaid Avenue in [[Coney Island]] and over time had four children: daughters '''Cathy''' and '''[[Nora Guthrie|Nora]]'''; and sons '''[[Arlo Guthrie|Arlo]]''' and '''Joady'''</span>
				<span class='text'>One of their children, Cathy, died as a result of a fire at the age of four, sending Guthrie into a serious depression</span>

				<span class='text'>During this period, Guthrie wrote and recorded ''[[Songs to Grow on for Mother and Child]]'', a collection of [[children's music]], which includes the song &quot;Goodnight Little Arlo (Goodnight Little Darlin')&quot;, written when Arlo was about nine years old</span>
				<span class='text'> 1948 [[Accidents and incidents in aviation|crash]] of a plane carrying 28 Mexican farm workers from [[Oakland, California]], in [[deportation]] back to Mexico inspired Woody to write &quot;[[Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>He received various diagnoses (including alcoholism and [[schizophrenia]]), but in 1952, it was finally determined that he was suffering from [[Huntington's disease]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Celebrity Diagnosis&quot;/&gt; a genetic disorder inherited from his mother</span>

				<span class='text'>With her, Guthrie wrote numerous Jewish lyrics</span>
				<span class='text'>Guthrie's Jewish lyrics can be traced to the unusual collaborative relationship he had with his mother-in-law, who lived across from Guthrie and his family in Brooklyn in the 1940s</span>
				<span class='text'>Guthrie (the Oklahoma troubadour) and Greenblatt (the Jewish wordsmith) often discussed their artistic projects and critiqued each other's works, finding common ground in their shared love of culture and social justice, despite very different backgrounds</span>
				<span class='text'>Their collaboration flourished in 1940s Brooklyn, where Jewish culture was interwoven with music, modern dance, poetry and anti-fascist, pro-labor, classic socialist activism</span>
				<span class='text'>Guthrie was inspired to write songs that came directly out of this unlikely relationship, both personal and political; he identified the problems of Jews with those of his fellow Okies and other oppressed peoples</span>
				<span class='text'>hese lyrics were rediscovered by [[Nora Guthrie]] and were set to music by the Jewish Klezmer group [[The Klezmatics]] with the release of ''Happy Joyous Hanukkah'' on JMG Records in 2007</span>
				<span class='text'>The Klezmatics also released ''Wonder Wheel&amp;nbsp;– Lyrics by Woody Guthrie'', an album of spiritual lyrics put to music composed by the band</span>
