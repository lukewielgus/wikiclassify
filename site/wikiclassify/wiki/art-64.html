				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Nevertheless, once branded as a heretic, Spinoza's clashes with authorities became more pronounced</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, questioned by two members of his synagogue, Spinoza apparently responded that God has a body and nothing in scripture says otherwise</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He was later attacked on the steps of the synagogue by a knife-wielding assailant shouting &quot;Heretic!&quot; He was apparently quite shaken by this attack and for years kept (and wore) his torn cloak, unmended, as a souvenir</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;/&gt; ran the family importing business</span>
				<span class='text'>The business ran into serious financial difficulties, however, perhaps as a result of the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In March 1656, Spinoza filed suit with the Amsterdam municipal authorities to be declared an orphan in order to escape his father's business debts and so that he could inherit his mother's estate (which at first was incorporated into his father's estate) without it being subject to his father's creditors</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In addition, after having made substantial contributions to the Talmud Torah synagogue in 1654 and 1655, he reduced his December 1655 contribution and his March 1656 pledge to nominal amounts (and the March 1656 pledge was never paid)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Nadler 2001, ch</span>
				<span class='text'>, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>6-27</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Spinoza was eventually able to relinquish responsibility for the business and its debts to his younger brother, Gabriel, and devote himself chiefly to the study of philosophy, especially the system expounded by [[Descartes]], and to optics</span>
				<span class='text'>==Expulsion from the Jewish community===On 27 July 1656, the Talmud Torah congregation of Amsterdam issued a writ of ''[[Herem (censure)|cherem]]'' (Hebrew: חרם, a kind of ban, shunning, ostracism, expulsion, or [[excommunication]]) against the 23-year-old Spinoza</span>

				<span class='text'>But having failed to make him mend his wicked ways, and, on the contrary, daily receiving more and more serious information about the abominable heresies which he practised and taught and about his monstrous deeds, and having for this numerous trustworthy witnesses who have deposed and born witness to this effect in the presence of the said Espinoza, they became convinced of the truth of the matter; and after all of this has been investigated in the presence of the honourable ''chachamin'' [sages], they have decided, with their consent, that the said Espinoza should be excommunicated and expelled from the people of Israel</span>
				<span class='text'>By the decree of the angels, and by the command of the holy men, we excommunicate, expel, curse and damn Baruch de Espinoza, with the consent of God, Blessed be He, and with the consent of all the Holy Congregation, in front of these holy Scrolls with the [[613 commandments|six-hundred-and-thirteen precepts]] which are written therein, with the excommunication with which Joshua banned Jericho, with the curse with which Elisha cursed the boys, and with all the curses which are written in the Book of the Law</span>
				<span class='text'>Cursed be he by day and cursed be he by night; cursed be he when he lies down, and cursed be he when he rises up; cursed be he when he goes out, and cursed be he when he comes in</span>
				<span class='text'>The Lord will not spare him; the anger and wrath of the Lord will rage against this man, and bring upon him all the curses which are written in this book, and the Lord will blot out his name from under heaven, and the Lord will separate him to his injury from all the tribes of Israel with all the curses of the covenant, which are written in the Book of the Law</span>
				<span class='text'>But you who cleave unto the Lord God are all alive this day</span>
				<span class='text'>We order that no one should communicate with him orally or in writing, or show him any favour, or stay with him under the same roof, or within four [[ell]]s of him, or read anything composed or written by him</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; There is no record of such testimony, but there appear to have been several likely reasons for the issuance of the censure</span>
				<span class='text'>irst, there were Spinoza's radical theological views that he was apparently expressing in public</span>
				<span class='text'>As philosopher and Spinoza biographer Steven Nadler puts it: &quot;No doubt he was giving utterance to just those ideas that would soon appear in his philosophical treatises</span>
				<span class='text'>In those works, Spinoza denies the immortality of the soul; strongly rejects the notion of a providential God—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; and claims that the Law was neither literally given by God nor any longer binding on Jews</span>
				<span class='text'>Can there be any mystery as to why one of history's boldest and most radical thinkers was sanctioned by an orthodox Jewish community?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Nadler, Baruch Spinoza, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, First published Fri 29 June 2001; substantive revision Mon 1 December 2008, [http://plato</span>
				<span class='text'>tanford</span>
				<span class='text'>du/entries/spinoza/#Bio plato</span>
				<span class='text'>tandord</span>
				<span class='text'>u]&lt;/ref&gt;Second, the Amsterdam Jewish community was largely composed of former &quot;conversos&quot; who had fled from the Portuguese Inquisition within the previous century, with their children and grandchildren</span>
				<span class='text'>This community must have been concerned to protect its reputation from any association with Spinoza lest his controversial views provide the basis for their own possible persecution or expulsion</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Nadler 2001, ch</span>
				<span class='text'>2, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>17–22</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; There is little evidence that the Amsterdam municipal authorities were directly involved in Spinoza's censure itself</span>
				<span class='text'>But &quot;in 1619, the town council expressly ordered [the Portuguese Jewish community] to regulate their conduct and ensure that the members of the community kept to a strict observance of Jewish law</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nadler 2001, ch</span>
				<span class='text'>, p</span>
				<span class='text'>9</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Other evidence makes it clear that the danger of upsetting the civil authorities was never far from mind, such as bans adopted by the synagogue on public wedding or funeral processions and on discussing religious matters with Christians, lest such activity might &quot;disturb the liberty we enjoy</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nadler 2001, ch</span>
				<span class='text'>, p</span>
				<span class='text'>0</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the issuance of Spinoza's censure was almost certainly, in part, an exercise in self-censorship by the Portuguese Jewish community in Amsterdam</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;See Nadler 2001, ch</span>
				<span class='text'>, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>9-21</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Third, it appears likely that Spinoza had already taken the initiative to separate himself from the Talmud Torah congregation and was vocally expressing his hostility to Judaism itself</span>
				<span class='text'>He had probably stopped attending services at the synagogue, either after the lawsuit with his sister or after the knife attack on its steps</span>
				<span class='text'>He might already have been voicing the view expressed later in his ''Theological-Political Treatise'' that the civil authorities should suppress Judaism as harmful to the Jews themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>Either for financial or other reasons,&lt;ref&gt;See Nadler 2001, ch</span>
				<span class='text'>, p</span>
				<span class='text'>8, n</span>
				<span class='text'>8, p</span>
				<span class='text'>89</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; he had in any case effectively stopped contributing to the synagogue by March 1656</span>
				<span class='text'>He had also committed the &quot;monstrous deed,&quot; contrary to the regulations of the synagogue and the views of certain rabbinical authorities (including Maimonides), of filing suit in a civil court rather than with the synagogue authorities&lt;ref&gt;Nadler 2001, ch</span>
				<span class='text'>, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>5-25</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;—to renounce his father's heritage, no less</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon being notified of the issuance of the censure, he is reported to have said: &quot;Very well; this does not force me to do anything that I would not have done of my own accord, had I not been afraid of a scandal</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Scruton 1986 (2002 ed</span>
				<span class='text'>, ch</span>
				<span class='text'>, p</span>
				<span class='text'>2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Thus, unlike most of the censure issued routinely by the Amsterdam congregation to discipline its members, the censure issued against Spinoza did not lead to repentance and so was never withdrawn</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the censure, Spinoza is said to have addressed an &quot;Apology&quot; (defence), written in Spanish, to the elders of the synagogue, &quot;in which he defended his views as orthodox, and condemned the rabbis for accusing him of 'horrible practices and other enormities' merely because he had neglected ceremonial observances</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Scruton 1986 (2002 ed</span>
				<span class='text'>, ch</span>
				<span class='text'>, p</span>
				<span class='text'>2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;Apology&quot; does not survive, but some of its contents may later have been included in his ''Theological-Political Treatise''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Scruton 1986 (2002 ed</span>
				<span class='text'>, ch</span>
				<span class='text'>, p</span>
				<span class='text'>2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; For example, he cited a series of cryptic statements by medieval biblical commentator [[Abraham Ibn Ezra]] intimating that certain apparently anachronistic passages of the Pentateuch (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> &quot;[t]he Canaanite was then in the land,&quot; Genesis 12:6, which Ibn Ezra called a &quot;mystery&quot; and exhorted those &quot;who understand[] it keep silent&quot;) were not of [[Mosaic authorship]] as proof that his own views had valid historical precedent</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;The most remarkable aspect of the censure may be not so much its issuance, or even Spinoza's refusal to submit, but the fact that Spinoza's expulsion from the Jewish community did not lead to his conversion to Christianity</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza kept the Latin (and so implicitly Christian) name Benedict de Spinoza, maintained a close association with the Collegiants, a Christian sect, even moved to a town near the Collegiants' headquarters, and was buried in a Christian graveyard—but there is no evidence or suggestion that he ever accepted baptism or participated in a Christian mass</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, by default, Baruch de Espinoza became the first secular Jew of modern Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Yitzhak Melamed 2012&quot;/&gt;In September 2012, the Portugees-Israëlietische Gemeente te Amsterdam asked the chief rabbi of their community [[Haham Pinchas Toledano]] to reconsider the cherem after consulting several Spinoza experts</span>
				<span class='text'>However he declined to remove it, citing Spinoza's &quot;preposterous ideas, where he was tearing apart the very fundamentals of our religion&quot;, and stating that Judaism did not share the modern concept of free speech</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza, however, deviated significantly from Epicureans by adhering to strict determinism, much like the Stoics before him, in contrast to the Epicurean belief in the probabilistic path of atoms, which is more in line with contemporary thought on [[quantum mechanics]]</span>

				<span class='text'>du/entries/epicurus/#3&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza's system imparted order and unity to the tradition of radical [[thought]], offering powerful weapons for prevailing against &quot;received authority</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He contended that everything that exists in Nature (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> everything in the Universe) is one Reality (substance) and there is only one set of rules governing the whole of the reality which surrounds us and of which we are part</span>
				<span class='text'>Spinoza viewed God and Nature as two names for the same reality,&lt;ref name=tws9912/&gt; namely a single, fundamental [[Substance theory|substance]] (meaning &quot;that which stands beneath&quot; rather than &quot;matter&quot;) that is the basis of the universe and of which all lesser &quot;entities&quot; are actually modes or modifications, that all things are determined by Nature to exist and cause effects, and that the complex chain of cause and effect is understood only in part</span>
				<span class='text'>His identification of God with nature was more fully explained in his posthumously published ''Ethics</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;ref name=tws908/&gt; Spinoza's main contention with Cartesian mind–body dualism was that, if mind and body were truly distinct, then it is not clear how they can coordinate in any manner</span>
				<span class='text'>Humans presume themselves to have [[free will]], he argues, which is a result of their awareness of appetites that affect their minds, while being unable to understand the reasons why they want and act as they do</span>
				<span class='text'>pinoza contends that &quot;''Deus sive Natura''&quot; is a being of infinitely many attributes, of which thought and extension are two</span>
				<span class='text'>His account of the nature of reality, then, seems to treat the physical and mental worlds as intertwined, causally related, and deriving from the same substance</span>
				<span class='text'>It is important to note here that, in Parts 3 through 4 of the ''Ethics'', Spinoza describes how the human mind is affected by both mental and physical factors</span>
				<span class='text'>He directly contests dualism</span>
				<span class='text'>The universal substance emanates both body and mind; while they are different attributes, there is no fundamental difference between these aspects</span>
				<span class='text'>This formulation is a historically significant solution to the [[mind–body problem]] known as [[neutral monism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Spinoza's system also envisages a God that does not rule over the universe by Providence in which God can make changes, but a God which itself is the deterministic system of which everything in nature is a part</span>
				<span class='text'>Spinoza argues that &quot;things could not have been produced by God in any other way or in any other order than is the case,&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Baruch Spinoza</span>
				<span class='text'>''Ethics'', in'' Spinoza: Complete Works'', trans</span>
				<span class='text'>by Samuel Shirley and ed</span>
				<span class='text'>by Michael L</span>
				<span class='text'>Morgan (Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2002), see Part I, Proposition 33</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; he directly challenges a transcendental God which actively responds to events in the universe</span>
				<span class='text'>Everything that has and will happen is a part of a long chain of cause and effect which, at a metaphysical level, humans are unable to change</span>
				<span class='text'>No amount of prayer or ritual will sway God</span>
				<span class='text'>Only knowledge of God, or the existence which humans inhabit, allows them to best respond to the world around them</span>
				<span class='text'>ot only is it impossible for two infinite substances to exist (two infinities being absurd),&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', Part I, Proposition 6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; God—being the ultimate substance—cannot be affected by anything else, or else it would be affected by something else, and not be the fundamental substance</span>
				<span class='text'>pinoza was a thoroughgoing [[determinism|determinist]] who held that absolutely everything that happens occurs through the operation of [[necessity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For him, even human behaviour is fully determined, with freedom being our capacity to know we are determined and to understand ''why'' we act as we do</span>
				<span class='text'>By forming more &quot;adequate&quot; ideas about what we do and our emotions or [[Affect (philosophy)|affections]], we become the adequate cause of our effects (internal or external), which entails an increase in activity (versus passivity)</span>
				<span class='text'>This means that we become both more free and more like God, as Spinoza argues in the Scholium to Prop</span>
				<span class='text'>49, Part II</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Spinoza also held that everything must necessarily happen the way that it does</span>
				<span class='text'>herefore, humans have no free will</span>
				<span class='text'>They believe, however, that their will is free</span>
				<span class='text'>This illusionary perception of freedom stems from our human consciousness, experience, and indifference to prior natural causes</span>
				<span class='text'>Humans think they are free but they ″dream with their eyes open″</span>
				<span class='text'>For Spinoza, our actions are guided entirely by natural impulses</span>
				<span class='text'>In his letter to G</span>
				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>Schuller (Letter 58), he wrote: &quot;men are conscious of their desire and unaware of the causes by which [their desires] are determined</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', Pt</span>
				<span class='text'>I, Prop</span>
				<span class='text'>XXXVI, Appendix: &quot;[M]en think themselves free inasmuch as they are conscious of their volitions and desires, and never even dream, in their ignorance, of the causes which have disposed them so to wish and desire</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;This picture of Spinoza's determinism is ever more illuminated through reading this famous quote in ''Ethics'': ″the infant believes that it is by free will that it seeks the breast; the angry boy believes that by free will he wishes vengeance; the timid man thinks it is with free will he seeks flight; the drunkard believes that by a free command of his mind he speaks the things which when sober he wishes he had left unsaid</span>
				<span class='text'>… All believe that they speak by a free command of the mind, whilst, in truth, they have no power to restrain the impulse which they have to speak</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;ref&gt;''Ethics'', Part III, Proposition 2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Thus for Spinoza morality and ethical judgement like choice is predicated on an illusion</span>
				<span class='text'>For Spinoza, ″Blame″ and ″Praise″ are non existent human ideals only fathomable in the mind because we are so acclimatized to human consciousness interlinking with our experience that we have a false ideal of choice predicated upon this</span>
				<span class='text'>pinoza's philosophy has much in common with [[Stoicism]] inasmuch as both philosophies sought to fulfil a therapeutic role by instructing people how to attain happiness</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Spinoza differed sharply from the Stoics in one important respect: he utterly rejected their contention that [[reason]] could defeat emotion</span>
				<span class='text'>On the contrary, he contended, an emotion can only be displaced or overcome by a stronger emotion</span>
				<span class='text'>For him, the crucial distinction was between active and passive emotions, the former being those that are rationally understood and the latter those that are not</span>
				<span class='text'>He also held that knowledge of true causes of passive emotion can transform it to an active emotion, thus anticipating one of the key ideas of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]]</span>

				<span class='text'>6&lt;/ref&gt;===Ethical philosophy===Spinoza shared ethical beliefs with ancient Epicureans, in renouncing ethics beyond the material world, although Epicureans focused more on physical pleasure and Spinoza more on emotional wellbeing</span>

				<span class='text'>tml&lt;/ref&gt; Encapsulated at the start in his ''Treatise on the Improvement of the Understanding'' (''Tractatus de intellectus emendatione'') is the core of Spinoza's ethical philosophy, what he held to be the true and final good</span>
				<span class='text'>Spinoza held good and evil to be [[relativism|relative]] concepts, claiming that nothing is intrinsically good or bad except relative to a particularity</span>
				<span class='text'>Things that had classically been seen as good or evil, Spinoza argued, were simply good or bad for humans</span>
				<span class='text'>Spinoza believes in a deterministic universe in which &quot;All things in nature proceed from certain [definite] necessity and with the utmost perfection</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Nothing happens by chance in Spinoza's world, and nothing is [[contingency|contingent]]</span>
				<span class='text'>==Spinoza's ''Ethics''==={{Main|Ethics (Spinoza)}}In the universe anything that happens comes from the essential nature of objects, or of God/Nature</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Spinoza, reality is perfection</span>
				<span class='text'>If circumstances are seen as unfortunate it is only because of our inadequate conception of reality</span>
				<span class='text'>While components of the chain of cause and effect are not beyond the understanding of human reason, human grasp of the infinitely complex whole is limited because of the limits of science to empirically take account of the whole sequence</span>
				<span class='text'>Spinoza also asserted that sense perception, though practical and useful, is inadequate for discovering truth</span>
				<span class='text'>His concept of &quot;[[conatus]]&quot; states that human beings' natural inclination is to strive toward preserving an essential being, and asserts that virtue/human power is defined by success in this preservation of being by the guidance of reason as one's central ethical doctrine</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Spinoza, the highest virtue is the intellectual love or knowledge of God/Nature/Universe</span>
				<span class='text'>lso in the &quot;Ethics&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedict|title=The Ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza discusses his beliefs about what he considers to be the three kinds of knowledge that come with perceptions</span>
				<span class='text'>The first kind of knowledge he writes about is the knowledge of experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>More precisely, this first type of knowledge can be known as the knowledge of things that could be “mutilated, confused, and without order</span>
				<span class='text'> {{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedict|title=The Ethics|date=1677|pages=Books 1–5}} Another explanation of what the first knowledge can be is that it is the knowledge of dangerous reasoning</span>
				<span class='text'>Dangerous reason lacks any type of rationality, and causes the mind to be in a “passive” state</span>
				<span class='text'>This type of “passive mind” that Spinoza writes about in the earlier books of The Ethics is a state of the mind in which adequate causes become passions</span>
				<span class='text'>pinoza’s second knowledge involves reasoning plus emotions</span>
				<span class='text'>He explains that this knowledge is had by the rationality of any adequate causes that have to do with anything common to the human mind</span>
				<span class='text'>An example of this could be anything that is classified as being of imperfect virtue</span>
				<span class='text'>Imperfect virtues are seen as those which are incomplete</span>
				<span class='text'>Many philosophers, such as Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle, would compare imperfect virtue to pagan virtue</span>
				<span class='text'>Spinoza defines the third and final knowledge as the knowledge of God, which requires rationality and reason of the mind</span>
				<span class='text'>In more detail, Spinoza uses this type of knowledge to join together the essence of God with the individual essence</span>
				<span class='text'>This knowledge is also formed from any adequate causes that include perfect virtue</span>
				<span class='text'>{{cite book|last1=Spinoza|first1=Benedict|title=The Ethics|date=1677|pages=Books 1–5}}In the final part of the &quot;[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]&quot;, his concern with the meaning of &quot;true blessedness&quot;, and his explanation of how emotions must be detached from external cause and so master them, foreshadow psychological techniques developed in the 1900s</span>
				<span class='text'>His concept of three types of knowledge—opinion, reason, intuition—and his assertion that intuitive knowledge provides the greatest satisfaction of mind, lead to his proposition that the more we are conscious of ourselves and Nature/Universe, the more perfect and blessed we are (in reality) and that only intuitive knowledge is eternal</span>
				<span class='text'>iven Spinoza's insistence on a completely ordered world where &quot;necessity&quot; reigns, [[Good and evil|Good and Evil]] have no absolute meaning</span>
				<span class='text'>The world as it exists looks imperfect only because of our limited perception</span>

				<span class='text'>God has infinitely many other attributes which are not present in our world</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to German philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]], when Spinoza wrote &quot;''Deus sive Natura''&quot; (God or Nature) Spinoza meant God was ''[[Natura naturans]]'' not ''[[Natura naturata]]'', and Jaspers believed that Spinoza, in his philosophical system, did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms, but rather that God's transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely Thought and Extension, signified God's ''immanence''</span>

				<span class='text'>That world is of course &quot;divisible&quot;; it has parts</span>
				<span class='text'>But Spinoza insists that &quot;no attribute of a substance can be truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be divided&quot; (Which means that one cannot conceive an attribute in a way that leads to division of substance), and that &quot;a substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible&quot; (Ethics, Part I, Propositions 12 and 13)</span>

				<span class='text'>Therefore, according to Jaspers, the pantheist formula &quot;One and All&quot; would apply to Spinoza only if the &quot;One&quot; preserves its transcendence and the &quot;All&quot; were not interpreted as the totality of finite things</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=ts64/&gt;[[Martial Guéroult]] suggested the term &quot;[[panentheism]]&quot;, rather than &quot;[[pantheism]]&quot; to describe Spinoza's view of the relation between God and the world</span>

				<span class='text'>Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure materialism, because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended [[Substance theory|substance]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This, for Jacobi, was the result of Enlightenment rationalism and it would finally end in absolute [[atheism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Moses Mendelssohn]] disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between [[theism]] and pantheism</span>
				<span class='text'>The issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time</span>

				<span class='text'>The 19th-century German Sanskritist [[Theodore Goldstücker]] was one of the early figures to notice the similarities between Spinoza's religious conceptions and the [[Vedanta]] tradition of India, writing that Spinoza's thought was &lt;blockquote&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>a western system of philosophy which occupies a foremost rank amongst the philosophies of all nations and ages, and which is so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy us that he was wholly unacquainted with their doctrines</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>We mean the philosophy of Spinoza, a man whose very life is a picture of that moral purity and intellectual indifference to the transitory charms of this world, which is the constant longing of the true Vedanta philosopher</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
