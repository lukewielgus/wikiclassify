				<span class='text'>There is no record of such testimony but there appear to have been several likely reasons for the issuance of the censure</span>
				<span class='text'>irst there were Spinozas radical theological views that he was apparently expressing in public</span>
				<span class='text'>As philosopher and Spinoza biographer Steven Nadler puts it No doubt he was giving utterance to just those ideas that would soon appear in his philosophical treatises</span>
				<span class='text'>In those works Spinoza denies the immortality of the soul strongly rejects the notion of a providential God‚Äîthe God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and claims that the Law was neither literally given by God nor any longer binding on Jews</span>
				<span class='text'>Can there be any mystery as to why one of historys boldest and most radical thinkers was sanctioned by an orthodox Jewish communitySteven Nadler Baruch Spinoza Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy First published Fri 29 June 2001 substantive revision Mon 1 December 2008 http  plato</span>

				<span class='text'>u Second the Amsterdam Jewish community was largely composed of former conversos who had fled from the Portuguese Inquisition within the previous century with their children and grandchildren</span>
				<span class='text'>This community must have been concerned to protect its reputation from any association with Spinoza lest his controversial views provide the basis for their own possible persecution or expulsion</span>
				<span class='text'>adler 2001 ch</span>
				<span class='text'>2 pp</span>
				<span class='text'>17‚Äì22</span>
				<span class='text'> There is little evidence that the Amsterdam municipal authorities were directly involved in Spinozas censure itself</span>
				<span class='text'>But in 1619 the town council expressly ordered the Portuguese Jewish community to regulate their conduct and ensure that the members of the community kept to a strict observance of Jewish law</span>
				<span class='text'>adler 2001 ch</span>
				<span class='text'> p</span>
				<span class='text'>9</span>
				<span class='text'> Other evidence makes it clear that the danger of upsetting the civil authorities was never far from mind such as bans adopted by the synagogue on public wedding or funeral processions and on discussing religious matters with Christians lest such activity might disturb the liberty we enjoy</span>
				<span class='text'>adler 2001 ch</span>
				<span class='text'> p</span>
				<span class='text'>0</span>
				<span class='text'> Thus the issuance of Spinozas censure was almost certainly in part an exercise in self censorship by the Portuguese Jewish community in Amsterdam</span>
				<span class='text'>ee Nadler 2001 ch</span>
				<span class='text'> pp</span>
				<span class='text'>9 21</span>
				<span class='text'>Third it appears likely that Spinoza had already taken the initiative to separate himself from the Talmud Torah congregation and was vocally expressing his hostility to Judaism itself</span>
				<span class='text'>He had probably stopped attending services at the synagogue either after the lawsuit with his sister or after the knife attack on its steps</span>
				<span class='text'>He might already have been voicing the view expressed later in his Theological Political Treatise that the civil authorities should suppress Judaism as harmful to the Jews themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>Either for financial or other reasonsSee Nadler 2001 ch</span>

				<span class='text'>89</span>
				<span class='text'> he had in any case effectively stopped contributing to the synagogue by March 1656</span>
				<span class='text'>He had also committed the monstrous deed contrary to the regulations of the synagogue and the views of certain rabbinical authorities including Maimonides of filing suit in a civil court rather than with the synagogue authoritiesNadler 2001 ch</span>

				<span class='text'>2</span>
				<span class='text'> Thus unlike most of the censure issued routinely by the Amsterdam congregation to discipline its members the censure issued against Spinoza did not lead to repentance and so was never withdrawn</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the censure Spinoza is said to have addressed an Apology defence written in Spanish to the elders of the synagogue in which he defended his views as orthodox and condemned the rabbis for accusing him of horrible practices and other enormities merely because he had neglected ceremonial observances</span>

				<span class='text'>name 0  The most remarkable aspect of the censure may be not so much its issuance or even Spinozas usal to submit but the fact that Spinozas expulsion from the Jewish community did not lead to his conversion to Christianity</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>everything in the Universe is one Reality substance and there is only one set of rules governing the whole of the reality which surrounds us and of which we are part</span>
				<span class='text'>Spinoza viewed God and Nature as two names for the same reality name tws9912  namely a single fundamental  meaning that which stands beneath rather than matter that is the basis of the universe and of which all lesser entities are actually modes or modifications that all things are determined by Nature to exist and cause effects and that the complex chain of cause and effect is understood only in part</span>
				<span class='text'>His identification of God with nature was more fully explained in his posthumously published Ethics</span>

				<span class='text'>His account of the nature of reality then seems to treat the physical and mental worlds as intertwined causally related and deriving from the same substance</span>
				<span class='text'>It is important to note here that in Parts 3 through 4 of the Ethics Spinoza describes how the human mind is affected by both mental and physical factors</span>
				<span class='text'>He directly contests dualism</span>
				<span class='text'>The universal substance emanates both body and mind while they are different attributes there is no fundamental difference between these aspects</span>

				<span class='text'> God‚Äîbeing the ultimate substance‚Äîcannot be affected by anything else or else it would be affected by something else and not be the fundamental substance</span>
				<span class='text'>pinoza was a thoroughgoing  who held that absolutely everything that happens occurs through the operation of </span>
				<span class='text'>For him even human behaviour is fully determined with freedom being our capacity to know we are determined and to understand why we act as we do</span>
				<span class='text'>By forming more adequate ideas about what we do and our emotions or  we become the adequate cause of our effects internal or external which entails an increase in activity versus passivity</span>
				<span class='text'>This means that we become both more free and more like God as Spinoza argues in the Scholium to Prop</span>
				<span class='text'>49 Part II</span>
				<span class='text'>However Spinoza also held that everything must necessarily happen the way that it does</span>
				<span class='text'>heore humans have no free will</span>
				<span class='text'>They believe however that their will is free</span>
				<span class='text'>This illusionary perception of freedom stems from our human consciousness experience and indifference to prior natural causes</span>
				<span class='text'>Humans think they are free but they ‚Ä≥dream with their eyes open‚Ä≥</span>
				<span class='text'>For Spinoza our actions are guided entirely by natural impulses</span>
				<span class='text'>In his letter to G</span>

				<span class='text'>I Prop</span>
				<span class='text'>XXXVI Appendix Men think themselves free inasmuch as they are conscious of their volitions and desires and never even dream in their ignorance of the causes which have disposed them so to wish and desire</span>
				<span class='text'>This picture of Spinozas determinism is ever more illuminated through reading this famous quote in Ethics ‚Ä≥the infant believes that it is by free will that it seeks the breast the angry boy believes that by free will he wishes vengeance the timid man thinks it is with free will he seeks flight the drunkard believes that by a free command of his mind he speaks the things which when sober he wishes he had left unsaid</span>

				<span class='text'> Thus for Spinoza morality and ethical judgement like choice is predicated on an illusion</span>
				<span class='text'>For Spinoza ‚Ä≥Blame‚Ä≥ and ‚Ä≥Praise‚Ä≥ are non existent human ideals only fathomable in the mind because we are so acclimatized to human consciousness interlinking with our experience that we have a false ideal of choice predicated upon this</span>
				<span class='text'>pinozas philosophy has much in common with  inasmuch as both philosophies sought to fulfil a therapeutic role by instructing people how to attain happiness</span>
				<span class='text'>However Spinoza differed sharply from the Stoics in one important respect he utterly rejected their contention that  could defeat emotion</span>
				<span class='text'>On the contrary he contended an emotion can only be displaced or overcome by a stronger emotion</span>
				<span class='text'>For him the crucial distinction was between active and passive emotions the former being those that are rationally understood and the latter those that are not</span>

				<span class='text'>6 Spinoza shared ethical beliefs with ancient Epicureans in renouncing ethics beyond the material world although Epicureans focused more on physical pleasure and Spinoza more on emotional wellbeing</span>

				<span class='text'>et en principal</span>
				<span class='text'>tml  Encapsulated at the start in his Treatise on the Improvement of the Understanding Tractatus de intellectus emendatione is the core of Spinozas ethical philosophy what he held to be the true and final good</span>
				<span class='text'>Spinoza held good and evil to be  concepts claiming that nothing is intrinsically good or bad except relative to a particularity</span>
				<span class='text'>Things that had classically been seen as good or evil Spinoza argued were simply good or bad for humans</span>
				<span class='text'>Spinoza believes in a deterministic universe in which All things in nature proceed from certain definite necessity and with the utmost perfection</span>
				<span class='text'>Nothing happens by chance in Spinozas world and nothing is </span>
				<span class='text'>n the universe anything that happens comes from the essential nature of objects or of God Nature</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Spinoza reality is perfection</span>
				<span class='text'>If circumstances are seen as unfortunate it is only because of our inadequate conception of reality</span>
				<span class='text'>While components of the chain of cause and effect are not beyond the understanding of human reason human grasp of the infinitely complex whole is limited because of the limits of science to empirically take account of the whole sequence</span>
				<span class='text'>Spinoza also asserted that sense perception though practical and useful is inadequate for discovering truth</span>
				<span class='text'>His concept of  states that human beings natural inclination is to strive toward preserving an essential being and asserts that virtue human power is defined by success in this preservation of being by the guidance of reason as ones central ethical doctrine</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Spinoza the highest virtue is the intellectual love or knowledge of God Nature Universe</span>
				<span class='text'>lso in the Ethics  Spinoza discusses his beliefs about what he considers to be the three kinds of knowledge that come with perceptions</span>
				<span class='text'>The first kind of knowledge he writes about is the knowledge of experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>More precisely this first type of knowledge can be known as the knowledge of things that could be ‚Äúmutilated confused and without order</span>
				<span class='text'>Äù  Another explanation of what the first knowledge can be is that it is the knowledge of dangerous reasoning</span>
				<span class='text'>Dangerous reason lacks any type of rationality and causes the mind to be in a ‚Äúpassive‚Äù state</span>
				<span class='text'>This type of ‚Äúpassive mind‚Äù that Spinoza writes about in the earlier books of The Ethics is a state of the mind in which adequate causes become passions</span>
				<span class='text'>pinoza‚Äôs second knowledge involves reasoning plus emotions</span>
				<span class='text'>He explains that this knowledge is had by the rationality of any adequate causes that have to do with anything common to the human mind</span>
				<span class='text'>An example of this could be anything that is classified as being of imperfect virtue</span>
				<span class='text'>Imperfect virtues are seen as those which are incomplete</span>
				<span class='text'>Many philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle would compare imperfect virtue to pagan virtue</span>
				<span class='text'>Spinoza defines the third and final knowledge as the knowledge of God which requires rationality and reason of the mind</span>
				<span class='text'>In more detail Spinoza uses this type of knowledge to join together the essence of God with the individual essence</span>
				<span class='text'>This knowledge is also formed from any adequate causes that include perfect virtue</span>
				<span class='text'>In the final part of the  his concern with the meaning of true blessedness and his explanation of how emotions must be detached from external cause and so master them foreshadow psychological techniques developed in the 1900s</span>
				<span class='text'>His concept of three types of knowledge‚Äîopinion reason intuition‚Äîand his assertion that intuitive knowledge provides the greatest satisfaction of mind lead to his proposition that the more we are conscious of ourselves and Nature Universe the more perfect and blessed we are in reality and that only intuitive knowledge is eternal</span>
				<span class='text'>iven Spinozas insistence on a completely ordered world where necessity reigns  have no absolute meaning</span>

				<span class='text'>That world is of course divisible it has parts</span>
				<span class='text'>But Spinoza insists that no attribute of a substance can be truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be divided Which means that one cannot conceive an attribute in a way that leads to division of substance and that a substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible Ethics Part I Propositions 12 and 13</span>
