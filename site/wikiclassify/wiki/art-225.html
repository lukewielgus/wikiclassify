				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=birth/&gt; However, the automobiles produced were of a lower quality and higher price than Ford wanted</span>
				<span class='text'>Ultimately, the company was not successful and was dissolved in January 1901</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=birth/&gt;With the help of [[C</span>
				<span class='text'>Harold Wills]], Ford designed, built, and successfully raced a 26-horsepower automobile in October 1901</span>
				<span class='text'>With this success, Murphy and other stockholders in the Detroit Automobile Company formed the [[Henry Ford Company]] on November 30, 1901, with Ford as chief engineer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=birth/&gt; In 1902, Murphy brought in [[Henry M</span>
				<span class='text'>Leland]] as a consultant; Ford, in response, left the company bearing his name</span>
				<span class='text'>With Ford gone, Murphy renamed the company the [[Cadillac Automobile Company]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=birth/&gt;Teaming up with former racing cyclist [[Tom Cooper (driver)|Tom Cooper]], Ford also produced the 80+ horsepower racer &quot;999&quot; which [[Barney Oldfield]] was to drive to victory in a race in October 1902</span>
				<span class='text'>Ford received the backing of an old acquaintance, [[Alexander Y</span>
				<span class='text'>Malcomson]], a Detroit-area coal dealer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=birth/&gt; They formed a partnership, &quot;Ford &amp; Malcomson, Ltd</span>

				<span class='text'>]In response, Malcomson brought in another group of investors and convinced the Dodge Brothers to accept a portion of the new company</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=birth/&gt; Ford &amp; Malcomson was reincorporated as the [[Ford Motor Company]] on June 16, 1903,&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; with $28,000 capital</span>

				<span class='text'> seconds and setting a new [[land speed record]] at {{convert|91</span>
				<span class='text'>|mph|km/h|abbr=off}}</span>
				<span class='text'>Convinced by this success, the race driver [[Barney Oldfield]], who named this new Ford model &quot;[[Ford 999|999]]&quot; in honor of the fastest locomotive of the day, took the car around the country, making the Ford brand known throughout the United States</span>
				<span class='text'>Ford also was one of the early backers of the [[Indianapolis 500]]</span>
				<span class='text'>===Model T====The [[Model T]] was introduced on October 1, 1908</span>
				<span class='text'>It had the steering wheel on the left, which every other company soon copied</span>
				<span class='text'>The entire engine and transmission were enclosed; the four cylinders were cast in a solid block; the suspension used two semi-elliptic springs</span>
				<span class='text'>The car was very simple to drive, and easy and cheap to repair</span>
				<span class='text'>It was so cheap at $825 in 1908 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|825|1908|r=-1}}}} today) (the price fell every year) that by the 1920s, a majority of American drivers had learned to drive on the Model T</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Richard Bak, ''Henry and Edsel: The Creation of the Ford Empire'' (2003) pp 54–63&lt;/ref&gt;Ford created a huge publicity machine in Detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and ads about the new product</span>
				<span class='text'>Ford's network of local dealers made the car ubiquitous in almost every city in North America</span>
				<span class='text'>As independent dealers, the franchises grew rich and publicized not just the Ford but the concept of automobiling; local motor clubs sprang up to help new drivers and to encourage exploring the countryside</span>
				<span class='text'>Ford was always eager to sell to farmers, who looked on the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business</span>
				<span class='text'>Sales skyrocketed—several years posted 100% gains on the previous year</span>
				<span class='text'>Always on the hunt for more efficiency and lower costs, in 1913 Ford introduced the moving assembly belts into his plants, which enabled an enormous increase in production</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Ford is often credited with the idea, contemporary sources indicate that the concept and its development came from employees [[Clarence Avery]], [[Peter E</span>
				<span class='text'>Martin]], [[Charles E</span>
				<span class='text'>Sorensen]], and [[C</span>
				<span class='text'>Harold Wills]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Nevins (1954) 1:387–415&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Ford Piquette Avenue Plant]])[[File:Ford assembly line - 1913</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|left|thumb|Ford assembly line, 1913]]Sales passed 250,000 in 1914</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1916, as the price dropped to $360 for the basic touring car, sales reached 472,000</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1976, pp 41–59&lt;/ref&gt; (Using the consumer price index, this price was equivalent to $7,020 in 2008 dollars</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1918, half of all cars in America were Model T's</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Until the development of the assembly line, which mandated black because of its quicker drying time, Model Ts were available in other colors, including red</span>
				<span class='text'>The design was fervently promoted and defended by Ford, and production continued as late as 1927; the final total production was 15,007,034</span>
				<span class='text'>This record stood for the next 45 years</span>
				<span class='text'>This record was achieved in 19 years from the introduction of the first Model T (1908)</span>
				<span class='text'>resident [[Woodrow Wilson]] asked Ford to run as a Democrat for the [[United States Senate]] from Michigan in 1918</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the nation was at war, Ford ran as a peace candidate and a strong supporter of the proposed [[League of Nations]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Watts, pp 243–48&lt;/ref&gt; Ford was defeated in a close election by the Republican candidate, [[Truman Newberry]], a former [[United States Secretary of the Navy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>enry Ford turned the presidency of Ford Motor Company over to his son Edsel Ford in December 1918</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry retained final decision authority and sometimes reversed his son</span>
				<span class='text'>Henry started another company, Henry Ford and Son, and made a show of taking himself and his best employees to the new company; the goal was to scare the remaining holdout stockholders of the Ford Motor Company to sell their stakes to him before they lost most of their value</span>
				<span class='text'>(He was determined to have full control over strategic decisions</span>
				<span class='text'> The ruse worked, and Henry and Edsel purchased all remaining stock from the other investors, thus giving the family sole ownership of the company</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Nevins and Hill (1957) vol 2&lt;/ref&gt;By the mid-1920s, sales of the Model T began to decline due to rising competition</span>
				<span class='text'>Other auto makers offered payment plans through which consumers could buy their cars, which usually included more modern mechanical features and styling not available with the Model T</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite urgings from Edsel, Henry refused to incorporate new features into the Model T or to form a customer credit plan</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:409-36&lt;/ref&gt;====Model A and Ford's later career====By 1926, flagging sales of the Model T finally convinced Henry to make a new model</span>
				<span class='text'>He pursued the project with a great deal of technical expertise in design of the engine, chassis, and other mechanical necessities, while leaving the body design to his son</span>
				<span class='text'>Edsel also managed to prevail over his father's initial objections in the inclusion of a sliding-shift transmission</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Sorensen1956p223&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=223}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The result was the successful [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Ford Model A]], introduced in December 1927 and produced through 1931, with a total output of more than 4&amp;nbsp;million</span>
				<span class='text'>Subsequently, the Ford company adopted an annual model change system similar to that recently pioneered by its competitor General Motors (and still in use by automakers today)</span>
				<span class='text'>Not until the 1930s did Ford overcome his objection to finance companies, and the Ford-owned [[Universal Credit Corporation]] became a major car-financing operation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:459-78&lt;/ref&gt;Ford did not believe in accountants; he amassed one of the world's largest fortunes without ever having his company [[audit]]ed under his administration</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|upright|''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, January 14, 1935]]Ford was a pioneer of &quot;[[welfare capitalism]]&quot;, designed to improve the lot of his workers and especially to reduce the heavy [[turnover (employment)|turnover]] that had many departments hiring 300 men per year to fill 100 slots</span>
				<span class='text'>Efficiency meant hiring and keeping the best workers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:508-40&lt;/ref&gt;Ford astonished the world in 1914 by offering a $5 per day wage (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1914|r=-1}}}} today), which more than doubled the rate of most of his workers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Using the [[consumer price index]], this was equivalent to $111</span>
				<span class='text'>0 per day in 2008 dollars</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; A Cleveland, Ohio newspaper editorialized that the announcement &quot;shot like a blinding rocket through the dark clouds of the present industrial depression</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''Public Image'' p 71&lt;/ref&gt; The move proved extremely profitable; instead of constant turnover of employees, the best mechanics in Detroit flocked to Ford, bringing their human capital and expertise, raising productivity, and lowering training costs</span>

				<span class='text'>4 to $5 for qualifying workers</span>
				<span class='text'>It also set a new, reduced workweek, although the details vary in different accounts</span>

				<span class='text'>They frowned on heavy drinking, gambling, and (what today are called) [[deadbeat parent|deadbeat dads]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Social Department used 50 investigators, plus support staff, to maintain employee standards; a large percentage of workers were able to qualify for this &quot;profit-sharing</span>

				<span class='text'>{{Anchor|No_prosperity_without_productivity}} Most wanted to restrict productivity as a means to foster employment, but Ford saw this as self-defeating because, in his view, productivity was necessary for any economic prosperity to exist</span>
				<span class='text'>e believed that productivity gains that obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the larger economy and thus grow new jobs elsewhere, whether within the same corporation or in others</span>
				<span class='text'>Ford also believed that union leaders had a [[perverse incentive]] to foment perpetual socio-economic crisis as a way to maintain their own power</span>
				<span class='text'>Meanwhile, he believed that smart managers had an incentive to do right by their workers, because doing so would maximize their own profits</span>
				<span class='text'>Ford did acknowledge, however, that many managers were basically too bad at managing to understand this fact</span>
				<span class='text'>But Ford believed that eventually, if good managers such as he could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> both socialists and bad-manager reactionaries), the good managers would create a socio-economic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing</span>

				<span class='text'>n the late 1930s and early 1940s, Edsel—who was president of the company—thought Ford had to come to some sort of [[collective bargaining]] agreement with the unions because the violence, work disruptions, and bitter stalemates could not go on forever</span>
				<span class='text'>But Henry, who still had the final veto in the company on a ''de facto'' basis even if not an official one, refused to cooperate</span>
				<span class='text'>For several years, he kept Bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the Ford Motor Company</span>
