				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;nick22&quot;/&gt; For the project, Carey worked with [[Walter Afanasieff]], who only had a small role on her debut, as well as [[Robert Clivillés]] and [[David Cole (record producer)|David Cole]], from the [[dance music|dance]] group [[C+C Music Factory]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;nick23&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carey's relationship with Margulies deteriorated over a personal contract Carey had signed with him before signing the record deal with Columbia, agreeing to split not only the songwriting royalties from the songs, but half of her earnings as well</span>
				<span class='text'>However, when the time came to write music for ''Emotions,'' Sony officials made it clear he would only be paid the fair amount given to co-writers on an album</span>
				<span class='text'>Margulies later filed a lawsuit against Sony which ultimately led to their parting of ways</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;nick22&quot;/&gt; ''Emotions'' was released on September 17, 1991, and was accepted by critics as a more mature album than its predecessor</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=nycc/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shapiro2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In hopes of putting to rest any claims of her being a manufactured artist, Carey and [[Walter Afanasieff]] decided to book an appearance on [[MTV Unplugged]], a television program aired by [[MTV]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;shapiro3&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2001|pp=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; They chose &quot;[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]&quot;, a song made popular by [[The Jackson 5]] in 1970</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;nickson27&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[revue]] was met with critical acclaim, leading to it being aired more than three times as often as an average episode would</span>
