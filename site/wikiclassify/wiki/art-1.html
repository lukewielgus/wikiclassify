				<span class='text'>Logic seems to have emerged from [[dialectics]]; the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' in their discussions, but never truly understood the logical implications</span>
				<span class='text'>Even Plato had difficulties with logic; although he had a reasonable conception of a [[deductive system]], he could never actually construct one, thus he relied instead on his [[dialectic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Bocheński, 1951&quot;&gt;Bocheński, 1951</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Plato believed that deduction would simply follow from [[premise]]s, hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the [[Logical consequence|conclusion]] would logically follow</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently, Plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial</span>
				<span class='text'>He never succeeded in devising such a method, but his best attempt was published in his book ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', where he introduced his division method</span>

				<span class='text'>The term &quot;logic&quot; he reserved to mean ''dialectics''</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers</span>
				<span class='text'>The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century CE:#''Categories''#''On Interpretation''#''Prior Analytics''#''Posterior Analytics''#''Topics''#''On Sophistical Refutations''The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings</span>
				<span class='text'>It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the ''Categories,'' the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in ''On Interpretation'', to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the ''Analytics'') and dialectics (in the ''Topics'' and ''Sophistical Refutations'')</span>
				<span class='text'>The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory ''stricto sensu'': the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning</span>
				<span class='text'>There is one volume of Aristotle's concerning logic not found in the ''Organon'', namely the fourth book of ''Metaphysics</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;ref name=&quot;Bocheński, 1951&quot;/&gt;===Aristotle's epistemology===[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle</span>

				<span class='text'>Aristotle gestures to the earth, representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation and experience, while holding a copy of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' in his hand, whilst Plato gestures to the heavens, representing his belief in [[The Forms]], while holding a copy of ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'']]Like his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle's [[ontology]], however, finds the universal in [[particular]] things, which he calls the essence of things, while in Plato's ontology, the universal exists apart from particular things, and is related to them as their [[prototype]] or [[wikt:exemplar|exemplar]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For Aristotle, therefore, [[epistemology]] is based on the study of particular phenomena and rises to the knowledge of essences, while for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal [[Theory of Forms|Forms]] (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these</span>
				<span class='text'>For Aristotle, &quot;form&quot; still refers to the unconditional basis of [[phenomena]] but is &quot;instantiated&quot; in a particular substance (see ''[[Aristotle#Universals and particulars|Universals and particulars]]'', below)</span>
				<span class='text'>In a certain sense, Aristotle's method is both [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]], while Plato's is essentially deductive from ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' principles</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jori | first =Alberto | title =Aristotele | publisher =Bruno Mondadori Editore | year =2003 | location =Milano}}&lt;/ref&gt;In Aristotle's terminology, &quot;natural philosophy&quot; is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>In modern times, the scope of ''philosophy'' has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries, such as ethics and metaphysics, in which logic plays a major role</span>
				<span class='text'>Today's philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method</span>
				<span class='text'>In contrast, Aristotle's philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry</span>
				<span class='text'>n the larger sense of the word, Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as &quot;science&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Note, however, that his use of the term ''science'' carries a different meaning than that covered by the term &quot;scientific method&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>For Aristotle, &quot;all science (''dianoia'') is either practical, poetical or theoretical&quot; (''Metaphysics'' 1025b25)</span>
				<span class='text'>By practical science, he means ethics and politics; by poetical science, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science, he means physics, mathematics and metaphysics</span>
				<span class='text'>f logic (or &quot;analytics&quot;) is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of: (1) [[Logic]]; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including Metaphysics, Physics and Mathematics; (3) Practical Philosophy and (4) Poetical Philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>n the period between his two stays in Athens, between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum, Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, most of Aristotle's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle's metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>He did, however, perform [[original research]] in the natural sciences, e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> botany, zoology, physics, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, and several other sciences</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotle's writings on science are largely qualitative, as opposed to quantitative</span>
				<span class='text'>Beginning in the 16th century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and Aristotle's work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate</span>
				<span class='text'>His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass, velocity, force and temperature</span>
				<span class='text'>He had a conception of speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers</span>
				<span class='text'>is writings provide an account of many scientific observations, a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, in his ''[[History of Animals]]'' he claimed that human males have more teeth than females</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''History of Animals'', 2</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, [[John Philoponus]], and later [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], showed by simple experiments that Aristotle's theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect</span>

				<span class='text'>Today's scientific method assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective, and that discerning the validity of one's hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotle also had some scientific blind spots</span>
				<span class='text'>He posited a [[geocentrism|geocentric cosmology]] that we may discern in selections of the ''Metaphysics'', which was widely accepted up until the 16th century</span>
				<span class='text'>From the 3rd century to the 16th century, the dominant view held that the Earth was the rotational [[History of the Center of the Universe|center of the universe]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ecause he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by European thinkers during and after the Renaissance, these thinkers often took Aristotle's erroneous positions as given, which held back science in this epoch</span>

				<span class='text'>61, 103–104</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, Aristotle's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields</span>
				<span class='text'>For instance, he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants</span>
				<span class='text'>==Geology===As quoted from [[w:Charles Lyell|Charles Lyell's]] ''[[Principles of Geology]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;He [Aristotle] refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on, and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages</span>
				<span class='text'>He instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up, and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized</span>
				<span class='text'>He points to the growth of the Nilotic delta since the time of Homer, to the shallowing of the [[Palus Maeotis]] within sixty years from his own time&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>He alludes&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>to the upheaving of one of the Eolian islands, previous to a volcanic eruption</span>
				<span class='text'>The changes of the earth, he says, are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives, that they are overlooked; and the migrations of people after great catastrophes, and their removal to other regions, cause the event to be forgotten</span>
				<span class='text'>e says [12th chapter of his ''Meteorics''] 'the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time, but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land, and again it becomes land where it was sea, and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system, and within a certain period</span>
				<span class='text'> The concluding observation is as follows: 'As time never fails, and the universe is eternal, neither the Tanais, nor the Nile, can have flowed for ever</span>
				<span class='text'>The places where they rise were once dry, and there is a limit to their operations, but there is none to time</span>
				<span class='text'>So also of all other rivers; they spring up and they perish; and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others The same tracts, therefore, of the earth are not some always sea, and others always continents, but every thing changes in the course of time</span>

				<span class='text'>7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;===Physics==={{main|Aristotelian physics}}====Five elements===={{main|Classical element}}Aristotle proposed a fifth element, aether, in addition to the four proposed earlier by [[Empedocles]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], which is cold and dry; this corresponds to the modern idea of a solid</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Water (classical element)|Water]], which is cold and wet; this corresponds to the modern idea of a liquid</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Air (classical element)|Air]], which is hot and wet; this corresponds to the modern idea of a gas</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], which is hot and dry; this corresponds to the modern ideas of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and heat</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Aether (classical element)|Aether]], which is the divine substance that makes up the [[Celestial spheres|heavenly spheres]] and heavenly bodies (stars and planets)</span>
				<span class='text'>ach of the four earthly elements has its natural place</span>
				<span class='text'>All that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> the center of the Earth</span>
				<span class='text'>Water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center</span>
				<span class='text'>Air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere</span>
				<span class='text'>Fire tends toward the lunar sphere (in which the Moon orbits)</span>
				<span class='text'>When elements are moved out of their natural place, they naturally move back towards it</span>
				<span class='text'>This is &quot;natural motion&quot;—motion requiring no extrinsic cause</span>
				<span class='text'>So, for example, in water, earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up; in air, rain falls and flame rises</span>
				<span class='text'>Outside all the other spheres, the heavenly, fifth element, manifested in the stars and planets, moves in the perfection of circles</span>
				<span class='text'>===Motion===={{main|potentiality and actuality}}Aristotle defined [[Motion (physics)|motion]] as the actuality of a potentiality ''as such''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' 201a10–11, 201a27–29, 201b4–5&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally; that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential, as a transition toward a potentially possible state</span>
				<span class='text'>Because [[Aristotle#Substance, potentiality and actuality|actuality and potentiality]] are normally opposites in Aristotle, other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous, or that the addition of the &quot;as such&quot; to the definition is critical to understanding it</span>

				<span class='text'>Thus the material cause of a table is wood, and the material cause of a car is rubber and steel</span>
				<span class='text'>It is not about action</span>
				<span class='text'>It does not mean one domino knocks over another domino</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[formal cause]] is its form, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> the arrangement of that matter</span>
				<span class='text'>It tells us what a thing is, that any thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype</span>
				<span class='text'>It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws, as the whole (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation</span>
				<span class='text'>Plainly put, the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor, and in the second place as intrinsic, determining cause, embodied in the matter</span>
				<span class='text'>Formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation</span>
				<span class='text'>A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create his drawings</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[efficient cause]] is &quot;the primary source&quot;, or that from which the change under consideration proceeds</span>
				<span class='text'>It identifies 'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed' and so suggests all sorts of agents, nonliving or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest</span>
				<span class='text'>Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of &quot;cause&quot; as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>So, take the two dominoes, this time of equal weighting, the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[final cause]] is its purpose, or that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities</span>
				<span class='text'>The final cause or teleos is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve</span>
				<span class='text'>This covers modern ideas of motivating causes, such as volition, need, desire, ethics, or spiritual beliefs</span>
				<span class='text'>dditionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal</span>
				<span class='text'>(Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect)</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes</span>
				<span class='text'>Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event</span>
				<span class='text'>Our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino, because it cannot fall of its own accord</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation</span>
				<span class='text'>All causes, proper and incidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic</span>
				<span class='text'>The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, operating causes to actual effects</span>
				<span class='text'>Essentially, causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect</span>
				<span class='text'>===Optics====Aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day</span>
				<span class='text'>The second oldest written evidence of a [[camera obscura]] (after [[Mozi]] c</span>
				<span class='text'>400 BC) can be found in Aristotle's documentation of such a device in 350&amp;nbsp;BC in ''Problemata''</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle's apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole, or [[aperture]], to allow for sunlight to enter</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was, the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object</span>
				<span class='text'>In modern cameras, this is analogous to the [[Diaphragm (optics)|diaphragm]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased, the image was magnified</span>

				<span class='text'>Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of [[sumbebekos|accidental things]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It is &quot;from what is spontaneous&quot; (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance)</span>
				<span class='text'>For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of &quot;chance&quot; it might be better to think of &quot;coincidence&quot;: Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place</span>
				<span class='text'>or example: A person seeks donations</span>
				<span class='text'>That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum</span>
				<span class='text'>However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance</span>
				<span class='text'>It must be unusual that something happens by chance</span>
				<span class='text'>In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance</span>
				<span class='text'>here is also more specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names &quot;luck&quot;, that can only apply to human beings, because it is in the sphere of moral actions</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Aristotle, luck must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Physics'' 2</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;===Metaphysics==={{main|Metaphysics (Aristotle)}}Aristotle defines metaphysics as &quot;the knowledge of [[hylomorphism|immaterial]] being,&quot; or of &quot;being in the highest degree of [[abstraction]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He refers to metaphysics as &quot;first philosophy&quot;, as well as &quot;the theologic science</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;====Substance, potentiality and actuality===={{see also|Potentiality and actuality (Aristotle)}}Aristotle examines the concepts of [[Substance theory|substance]] and [[essence]] (''ousia'') in his ''Metaphysics'' (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form</span>
				<span class='text'>In book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the [[Material substratum|substratum]], or the stuff of which it is composed</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc</span>
				<span class='text'> or whatever constitutes the ''potential'' house, while the form of the substance is the ''actual'' house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other [[Genus-differentia definition|differentia]] (see also [[predicables]]) that let us define something as a house</span>
				<span class='text'>The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' VIII 1043a 10–30&lt;/ref&gt;With regard to the change (''[[Potentiality and actuality|kinesis]]'') and its causes now, as he defines in his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'' 319b–320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from:# growth and diminution, which is change in quantity;# locomotion, which is change in space; and# alteration, which is change in quality</span>
				<span class='text'>he coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property</span>
				<span class='text'>In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (''[[Dunamis|dynamis]]'') and actuality (''[[entelecheia]]'') in association with the matter and the form</span>
				<span class='text'>eferring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (''dynamei'') plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant</span>
				<span class='text'>Potentially beings can either 'act' (''poiein'') or 'be acted upon' (''paschein''), which can be either innate or learned</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate&amp;nbsp;– being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise&amp;nbsp;– acting)</span>
				<span class='text'>ctuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality</span>
				<span class='text'>Because the end (''telos'') is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end</span>
				<span class='text'>Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;For that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired</span>
				<span class='text'>For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' IX 1050a 5–10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a [[final cause]] or end</span>
				<span class='text'>Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality</span>
				<span class='text'>ith this [[definition]] of the particular substance (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, &quot;what is it that makes a man one&quot;? Since, according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same thing</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' VIII 1045a–b&lt;/ref&gt;====Universals and particulars===={{main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property, or a relation to other things</span>
				<span class='text'>When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple</span>
				<span class='text'>In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other</span>
				<span class='text'>lato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but &quot;good&quot; is still a proper universal form</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Bertrand Russell]] is a 20th-century philosopher who agreed with Plato on the existence of &quot;uninstantiated universals&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist</span>
				<span class='text'>n addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals</span>
				<span class='text'>As Plato spoke of the world of the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated</span>
				<span class='text'>So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms</span>
				<span class='text'>==Biology and medicine===In Aristotelian science, especially in biology, things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others, which contain error and superstition</span>
				<span class='text'>He dissected animals but not humans; his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded</span>
				<span class='text'>===Empirical research program====[[File:Octopus3</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Octopus swimming]][[File:Torpedo fuscomaculata2</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|''Torpedo fuscomaculata'']][[File:Triakis semifasciata</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Leopard shark]]Aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of [[Lesbos]], and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas</span>
				<span class='text'>The works that reflect this research, such as ''[[History of Animals]]'', ''[[Generation of Animals]]'', and ''[[Parts of Animals]]'', contain some observations and interpretations, along with sundry myths and mistakes</span>
				<span class='text'>The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen</span>
				<span class='text'>His observations on [[catfish]], [[Electric ray|electric fish]] (''[[Torpedo (genus)|Torpedo]]'') and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on [[cephalopod]]s, namely, ''Octopus'', ''Sepia'' ([[cuttlefish]]) and the paper nautilus (''[[Argonauta argo]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>His description of the [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]], used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'>He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selachē ([[selachians]])</span>

				<span class='text'>What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates, Aristotle called 'animals with blood' and 'animals without blood' (he did not know that complex invertebrates do make use of [[hemoglobin]], but of a different kind from vertebrates)</span>
				<span class='text'>Animals with blood were divided into live-bearing (mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish)</span>
				<span class='text'>Invertebrates ('animals without blood') are insects, crustacea (divided into non-shelled – cephalopods – and shelled) and testacea (molluscs)</span>
				<span class='text'>In some respects, this incomplete classification is better than that of [[Linnaeus]], who crowded the invertebrata together into two groups, Insecta and Vermes (worms)</span>
				<span class='text'>or [[Charles Singer]], &quot;Nothing is more remarkable than [Aristotle's] efforts to [exhibit] the relationships of living things as a ''scala naturae''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Singer, Charles 1931&quot;/&gt; Aristotle's ''History of Animals'' classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical &quot;[[Great chain of being|Ladder of Life]]&quot; (''scala naturae'' or [[Great Chain of Being]]), placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, of course, is not responsible for the later use made of this idea by clerics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Aristotle believed that intellectual purposes, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> [[final cause]]s, guided all natural processes</span>
				<span class='text'>Such a [[teleological]] view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design</span>
				<span class='text'>Noting that &quot;no animal has, at the same time, both tusks and horns,&quot; and &quot;a single-hooved animal with two horns I have never seen,&quot; Aristotle suggested that Nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary</span>
				<span class='text'>Noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth, he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter, with Nature trying to preserve a type of balance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Mason, ''A History of the Sciences'' pp</span>
				<span class='text'>43–44&lt;/ref&gt;In a similar fashion, Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man, the ''scala naturae''</span>

				<span class='text'>201–202; see also: Lovejoy, ''The Great Chain of Being''&lt;/ref&gt; His system had eleven grades, arranged according &quot;to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality&quot;, expressed in their form at birth</span>
				<span class='text'>The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotle also held that the level of a creature's perfection was reflected in its form, but not preordained by that form</span>
				<span class='text'>Ideas like this, and his ideas about souls, are not regarded as science at all in modern times</span>
				<span class='text'>e placed emphasis on the type(s) of soul an organism possessed, asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth, animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation, and humans a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''De Anima'' II 3&lt;/ref&gt;Aristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain</span>

				<span class='text'>Aristotle believed an &quot;imprint&quot; becomes impressed on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory</span>
				<span class='text'>A memory occurs when a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] is too complex that the nervous system (semi-fluid bodily organ) cannot receive all the impressions at once</span>
				<span class='text'>These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of [[sense|sensation]], [[common sense]], and [[thinking]] </span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Bloch|2007|p=61}} The mental picture imprinted on the bodily organ is the final product of the entire process of sense perception</span>

				<span class='text'>First, the actual retaining of the experience in the [[mnemonic]] &quot;imprint&quot; that can develop from sensation</span>
				<span class='text'>Second, the intellectual anxiety that comes with the &quot;imprint&quot; due to being impressed at a particular time and processing specific contents</span>
				<span class='text'>These abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, memory is of the past, {{sfn|Bloch|2007|p=25}} prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present</span>
				<span class='text'>The retrieval of our &quot;imprints&quot; cannot be performed suddenly</span>
				<span class='text'>A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences, both for our previous experience and present experience</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotle proposed that slow-witted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the &quot;imprint&quot; can easily continue</span>
				<span class='text'>However, they cannot be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new &quot;imprints&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He believed the young and the old do not properly develop an &quot;imprint&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Young people undergo rapid changes as they develop, while the elderly's organs are beginning to decay, thus stunting new &quot;imprints&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Likewise, people who are too quick-witted are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ</span>
				<span class='text'>Because intellectual functions are not involved in memory, memories belong to some animals too, but only those in which have [[perception]] of time</span>
				<span class='text'>====Recollection=====Because Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or &quot;imprints&quot;, people are continually weaving together new &quot;imprints&quot; of things they experience</span>
				<span class='text'>In order to search for these &quot;imprints&quot;, people search the memory itself</span>

				<span class='text'>If the chain of &quot;images&quot; is needed, one memory will stimulate the other</span>
				<span class='text'>If the chain of &quot;images&quot; is not needed, but expected, then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances</span>
				<span class='text'>When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated the one that was needed</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Warren|1921|p=25}}Recollection is the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory &quot;imprint&quot; after some time has passed</span>
				<span class='text'>Retrieval of stored information is dependent on the scope of mnemonic capabilities of a being (human or animal) and the abilities the human or animal possesses </span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Carruthers|2007|p=19}} Only humans will remember &quot;imprints&quot; of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words</span>
				<span class='text'>Animals that have perception of time will be able to retrieve memories of their past observations</span>
				<span class='text'>Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed</span>
				<span class='text'>Recollection of an &quot;imprint&quot; is when the present experiences a person remembers are similar with elements corresponding in character and arrangement of past sensory experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>When an &quot;imprint&quot; is recalled, it may bring forth a large group of related &quot;imprints&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Warren|1921|p=296}}Aristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain &quot;imprints&quot;, was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships: similarity, contrast, and contiguity</span>
				<span class='text'>These three laws make up his [[Laws of Association]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind</span>
				<span class='text'>A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ref 2&quot;/&gt; While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during wakefulness</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ref 2&quot;/&gt; Since a person cannot sense during sleep they can also not have a desire, which is the result of a sensation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ref 2&quot;/&gt; However, the senses are able to work during sleep,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref 2&quot;/&gt; albeit differently than when a person is awake because during sleep a person can still have sensory experiences</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt; Also, all of the senses are not inactive during sleep, only the ones that are weary</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ref 2&quot;/&gt;=====Theory of dreams=====Dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus because, as discussed, the senses do not work as they normally do during sleep</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ref 2&quot;/&gt; In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner than when awake</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ref 2&quot;/&gt; Aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt; When they look away from that stimulus, the next thing they look at appears to be moving in a wave like motion</span>
				<span class='text'>When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention, it leaves an impression</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt; When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ref 2&quot;/&gt; However, during sleep the impressions stimuli made throughout the day become noticed because there are not new sensory experiences to distract from these impressions that were made</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt; So, dreams result from these lasting impressions</span>
				<span class='text'>Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams will not resemble the actual experience that occurred when awake</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt; Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt; For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt; When a person is asleep, their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like a person who is influenced by strong feelings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt; Since a person sleeping is in this suggestible state, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt; This in turn leads the person to believe the dream is real</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt; Dreams may be absurd in nature but the senses are not able to discern whether they are real or not</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Aristotle on Dreaming: What Goes on in Sleep when the 'Big Fire' goes out&quot;/&gt; So, the dreamer is left to accept the dream because they lack the choice to judge it</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Webb&quot;/&gt; Aristotle reasoned that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are happenstances not divinations</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Webb&quot;/&gt; These ideas were contradictory to what had been believed about dreams, but at the time in which he introduced these ideas more thinkers were beginning to give naturalistic as opposed to supernatural explanations to phenomena</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Webb&quot;/&gt;Aristotle also includes in his theory of dreams what constitutes a dream and what does not</span>
				<span class='text'>He claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Modrak&quot;/&gt; If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Modrak&quot;/&gt; Secondly, any sensory experience that actually occurs while a person is asleep and is perceived by the person while asleep does not qualify as part of a dream</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Modrak&quot;/&gt; For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut, Aristotle argues that this sensory experience is not part of the dream</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Modrak&quot;/&gt; The actual sensory experience is perceived by the senses, the fact that it occurred while the person was asleep does not make it part of the dream</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Modrak&quot;/&gt; Lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of sensory experiences had when awake</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Modrak&quot;/&gt;===Practical philosophy=======Ethics===={{main|Aristotelian ethics}}Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>ristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (''ergon'') of a thing</span>
				<span class='text'>An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the ''[[De Anima|psuchē]]'' (normally translated as ''soul'') in accordance with reason (''[[logos]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, ''[[eudaimonia]]'', generally translated as &quot;happiness&quot; or sometimes &quot;well being&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (''ēthikē'' ''[[arete (moral virtue)|aretē]]''), often translated as moral (or ethical) virtue (or excellence)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics]] Book I</span>
				<span class='text'>See for example chapter 7 [http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>054%3Abekker%20page%3D1098a 1098a]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things</span>
				<span class='text'>When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (''[[phronesis]]'') and their intellect (''[[nous]]'') can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished [[theory|theoretical]] or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher</span>

				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|240px|Aristotle's classification of [[constitution]]s]]In addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual, &quot;for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Politics 1253a19–24&lt;/ref&gt; He also famously stated that &quot;man is by nature a political animal&quot; and also arguing that humanity's defining factor among others in the [[Animal|animal kingdom]] is its [[rationality]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (''[[polis]]'') which functions as a political &quot;community&quot; or &quot;partnership&quot; (''koinōnia'')&lt;!-- (1252a1) --&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability&lt;!-- (1280b29–31) --&gt;, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: &quot;The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together&lt;!-- (1281a1–3) --&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with [[social contract]] theory, according to which individuals leave the [[state of nature]] because of &quot;fear of violent death&quot; or its &quot;inconveniences</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> the supreme by nature, and that the law rules and alone is authoritative; but the law is a kind of intelligence, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>a discourse based on intelligence</span>
				<span class='text'>And again, what standard do we have, what criterion of good things, that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad</span>
				<span class='text'>And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence it's evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods</span>
				<span class='text'>'====Rhetoric and poetics===={{main|Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Poetics (Aristotle)}}Aristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[Mimesis|imitative]], each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' I 1447a&lt;/ref&gt; For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language</span>
				<span class='text'>The forms also differ in their object of imitation</span>
				<span class='text'>Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average</span>
				<span class='text'>Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV&lt;/ref&gt;While it is believed that Aristotle's ''Poetics'' comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' VI&lt;/ref&gt; The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy</span>
				<span class='text'>Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the [[catharsis]] of those same emotions</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle concludes ''Poetics'' with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic [[mimesis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' XXVI&lt;/ref&gt;Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] and studied the fables of [[Aesop]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;According to a distinction that originates with Aristotle himself, his writings are divisible into two groups: the &quot;[[exoteric]]&quot; and the &quot;[[esoteric]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>2, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>408–410</span>
				<span class='text'>Ross defends an interpretation according to which the phrase, at least in Aristotle's own works, usually refers generally to &quot;discussions not peculiar to the [[Peripatetic school]]&quot;, rather than to specific works of Aristotle's own</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works Aristotle intended for the public (exoteric), and the more technical works intended for use within the [[Lyceum]] course / school (esoteric)</span>

				<span class='text'>rg/details/aristotlespoetic032945mbp|page=35|title=Aristotles Poetics|year=1956|author=Humphry House}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be Aristotle's own (unpolished) lecture notes (or in some cases possible notes by his students)</span>

				<span class='text'>12</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; However, one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation</span>
				<span class='text'>The 5th century [[neoplatonist]] [[Ammonius Hermiae]] writes that Aristotle's writing style is deliberately [[Obscurantism|obscurantist]] so that &quot;good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more, whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Ammonius | year= 1991 | title= On Aristotle's Categories | location= Ithaca, NY | publisher= Cornell University Press | isbn= 0-8014-2688-X}} p</span>
				<span class='text'>15&lt;/ref&gt;Another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant – that all of Aristotle's extant writings are of the esoteric kind</span>
				<span class='text'>Current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious, though many of them may have been in dialogue form</span>
				<span class='text'>(''Fragments'' of some of Aristotle's dialogues have survived</span>
				<span class='text'> Perhaps it is to these that [[Cicero]] refers when he characterized Aristotle's writing style as &quot;a river of gold&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Cicero | first =Marcus Tullius | title =''flumen orationis aureum fundens Aristoteles'' | work =Academica Priora | date =106 BC – 43 BC | url =http://www2</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Barnes, Life and Work, p</span>
				<span class='text'>12&quot;/&gt; However, some modern scholars have warned that we cannot know for certain that Cicero's praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works; a few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in Aristotle's extant works</span>

				<span class='text'>174 n</span>
				<span class='text'>240</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;One major question in the history of Aristotle's works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, and how did the ones we now possess come to us&lt;ref&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>he definitive, English study of these questions is Barnes, &quot;Roman Aristotle&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by [[Strabo]] in his ''Geography'' and [[Plutarch]] in his ''[[Parallel Lives]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sulla</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor Theophrastus, who in turn willed them to [[Neleus of Scepsis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to [[Scepsis]], where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 1st century BC, when [[Apellicon of Teos]] discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens</span>
				<span class='text'>According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text</span>
				<span class='text'>When [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to Rome, where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian [[Tyrannion of Amisus]] and then by the philosopher [[Andronicus of Rhodes]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ancient Rome: from the early Republic to the assassination of Julius Caesar – Page 513, Matthew Dillon, Lynda Garland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 22 – Page 131, Grolier Incorporated – Juvenile Nonfiction&lt;/ref&gt;Carnes Lord attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides &quot;the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the Peripatetic school after the middle of the third century, and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of Aristotle throughout the Hellenistic period, as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing Aristotelianism during the first century B</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lord |first=Carnes |title=Introduction to the Politics, by Aristotle |publisher=[[Chicago University Press]] |year=1984 |location=Chicago |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story, however</span>
				<span class='text'>First, the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by Apellicon's inexpert attempt at repair</span>
				<span class='text'>econd, there is &quot;incontrovertible evidence,&quot; Lord says, that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which Strabo and Plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in Scepsis</span>
				<span class='text'>Third, the definitive edition of Aristotle's texts seems to have been made in Athens some fifty years before Andronicus supposedly compiled his</span>
				<span class='text'>And fourth, ancient library catalogues predating Andronicus' intervention list an Aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess</span>
				<span class='text'>Lord sees a number of post-Aristotelian interpolations in the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', for example, but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact</span>
				<span class='text'>n the one hand, the surviving texts of Aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts, but rather from working drafts used within Aristotle's school, as opposed, on the other hand, to the [[Corpus Aristotelicum#Fragments|dialogues and other &quot;exoteric&quot; texts]] which Aristotle published more widely during his lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'>The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle's school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Bertrand Russell]] notes that &quot;almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Russell also refers to Aristotle's ethics as &quot;repulsive&quot;, and calls his logic &quot;as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;philosophy1972&quot;/&gt;===Later Greek philosophers===The immediate influence of Aristotle's work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the [[Peripatetic school]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle's notable students included [[Aristoxenus]], [[Dicaearchus]], [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], [[Eudemos of Rhodes]], [[Harpalus]], [[Hephaestion]], [[Meno (disambiguation)|Meno]], [[Mnason of Phocis]], [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], and [[Theophrastus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers</span>
				<span class='text'>He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher</span>
				<span class='text'>Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained &quot;Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Alexander''&lt;/ref&gt;===Influence on Byzantine scholars===Greek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle by copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus</span>

				<span class='text'>[[Averroes]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Alpharabius]], who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced [[Thomas Aquinas]] and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers</span>

				<span class='text'>In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made, both from Arabic translations, such as those by [[Gerard of Cremona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{SEP|arabic-islamic-influence|Influence of Arabic and Islamic Philosophy on the Latin West}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the original Greek, such as those by [[James of Venice]] and [[William of Moerbeke]]</span>
				<span class='text'>fter [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote his theology, working from Moerbeke's translations, the demand for Aristotle's writings grew and the [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the [[Renaissance]]</span>

				<span class='text'>The medieval English poet [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] describes his student as being happy by having:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'' at his beddes heed'':''Twenty bookes, clad in blak or reed,'':''Of aristotle and his philosophie,''&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Chaucer, ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', Prologue, lines 295–295&lt;/ref&gt;The Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] says of Aristotle in [[The Divine Comedy|the first circles of hell]],:''I saw the Master there of those who know,'':''Amid the philosophic family,'':''By all admired, and by all reverenced;'':''There Plato too I saw, and Socrates,'':''Who stood beside him closer than the rest</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Durant, p</span>
				<span class='text'>86&lt;/ref&gt; However debatable this is, Aristotle rigid separated action from production, and argued for the deserved subservience of some people (&quot;natural [[slavery|slaves]]&quot;), and the natural superiority (virtue, ''arete'') of others</span>
				<span class='text'>It is [[Martin Heidegger]], not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Ayn Rand]] accredited Aristotle as &quot;the greatest philosopher in history&quot; and cited him as a major influence on her thinking</span>
				<span class='text'>More recently, [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans</span>
