				<span class='text'>Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality</span>
				<span class='text'>The only life worth living is the spiritual oneâ€”to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1914, it had been providing him with an income of 300,000 [[Austro-Hungarian krone|Kronen]] a year, but by 1919 was worth a great deal more, with a sizable portfolio of investments in the [[United States]] and the [[Netherlands]]</span>

				<span class='text'>His first letters describe it as beautiful, but in October 1921, he wrote to Russell: &quot;I am still at Trattenbach, surrounded, as ever, by odiousness and baseness</span>

				<span class='text'>He did not get on well with the other teachers; when he found his lodgings too noisy, he made a bed for himself in the school kitchen</span>
				<span class='text'>He was an enthusiastic teacher, offering late-night extra tuition to several of the students, something that did not endear him to the parents, though some of them came to adore him; his sister Hermine occasionally watched him teach and said the students &quot;literally crawled over each other in their desire to be chosen for answers or demonstrations</span>

				<span class='text'>71-2}}While Wittgenstein was living in isolation in rural Austria, the ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|Tractatus]]'' was published to considerable interest, first in German in 1921 as ''Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung'', part of [[Wilhelm Ostwald]]'s journal ''Annalen der Naturphilosophie'', though Wittgenstein was not happy with the result and called it a pirate edition</span>
				<span class='text'>Russell had agreed to write an introduction to explain why it was important, because it was otherwise unlikely to have been published: it was difficult if not impossible to understand, and Wittgenstein was unknown in philosophy</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to Russell, Wittgenstein wrote &quot;The main point is the theory of what can be expressed (gesagt) by prop[osition]sâ€”i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>It was Moore who suggested ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' for the title, an allusion to [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s ''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</span>
				<span class='text'>' Initially there were difficulties in finding a publisher for the English edition too, because Wittgenstein was insisting it appear without Russell's introduction; Cambridge University Press turned it down for that reason</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally in 1922 an agreement was reached with Wittgenstein that Kegan Paul would print a bilingual edition with Russell's introduction and the Ramsey-Ogden translation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;archiveTractatus&quot;/&gt; This is the translation that was approved by Wittgenstein, but it is problematic in a number of ways</span>
				<span class='text'>Wittgenstein's English was poor at the time, and Ramsey was a teenager who had only recently learned German, so philosophers often prefer to use a 1961 translation by [[David Pears]] and Brian McGuinness</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;For example, Ramsey translated &quot;''Sachverhalt''&quot; and &quot;''Sachlage''&quot; as &quot;atomic fact&quot; and &quot;state of affairs&quot; respectively</span>
				<span class='text'>But Wittgenstein discusses non-existent &quot;''Sachverhalten''&quot;, and there cannot be a non-existent fact</span>
				<span class='text'>Pears and McGuinness made a number of changes, including translating &quot;''Sachverhalt''&quot; as &quot;state of affairs&quot; and &quot;''Sachlage''&quot; as ''situation''</span>
				<span class='text'>The new translation is often preferred, but some philosophers use the original, in part because Wittgenstein approved it, and because it avoids the idiomatic English of Pears-McGuinness</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;An incident occurred in April 1926 and became known as ''Der Vorfall Haidbauer'' (the Haidbauer incident)</span>
				<span class='text'>Josef Haidbauer was an 11-year-old pupil whose father had died and whose mother worked as a local maid</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a slow learner, and one day Wittgenstein hit him two or three times on the head, causing him to collapse</span>
				<span class='text'>Wittgenstein carried him to the headmaster's office, then quickly left the school, bumping into a parent, Herr Piribauer, on the way out</span>
				<span class='text'>Piribauer had been sent for by the children when they saw Haidbauer collapse; Wittgenstein had previously pulled Piribauer's daughter, Hermine, so hard by the ears that her ears had bled</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Monk225&gt;Monk, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>224, 232â€“233</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Piribauer said that when he met Wittgenstein in the hall that day: &quot;I called him all the names under the sun</span>
				<span class='text'>I told him he wasn't a teacher, he was an animal-trainer! And that I was going to fetch the police right away!&quot;&lt;ref name=Monk225/&gt;Piribauer tried to have Wittgenstein arrested, but the village's police station was empty, and when he tried again the next day he was told Wittgenstein had disappeared</span>
				<span class='text'>On 28 April 1926, Wittgenstein handed in his resignation to Wilhelm Kundt, a local school inspector, who tried to persuade him to stay; however, Wittgenstein was adamant that his days as a schoolteacher were over</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Monk225/&gt; Proceedings were initiated in May, and the judge ordered a psychiatric report; in August 1926 a letter to Wittgenstein from a friend, Ludwig HÃ¤nsel, indicates that hearings were ongoing, but nothing is known about the case after that</span>
				<span class='text'>Alexander Waugh writes that Wittgenstein's family and their money may have had a hand in covering things up</span>
				<span class='text'>Waugh writes that Haidbauer died shortly afterwards of haemophilia; Monk says he died when he was 14 of leukaemia</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Ten years later, in 1936, as part of a series of &quot;confessions&quot; he engaged in that year, Wittgenstein appeared without warning at the village saying he wanted to confess personally and ask for pardon from the children he had hit</span>
				<span class='text'>He visited at least four of the children, including Hermine Piribauer, who apparently replied only with a &quot;Ja, ja,&quot; though other former students were more hospitable</span>
				<span class='text'>Monk writes that the purpose of these confessions was not &quot;to hurt his pride, as a form of punishment; it was to dismantle itâ€”to remove a barrier, as it were, that stood in the way of honest and decent thought</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Of the apologies, Wittgenstein wrote, &quot;This brought me into more settled waters</span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===The Vienna Circle==={{See also|Vienna Circle}}The ''Tractatus'' was now the subject of much debate amongst philosophers, and Wittgenstein was a figure of increasing international fame</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, a discussion group of philosophers, scientists and mathematicians, known as the [[Vienna Circle]], had built up largely as a result of the inspiration they had been given by reading the ''Tractatus''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Monk212/&gt; From 1926, with the members of the Vienna Circle, Wittgenstein would take part in many discussions</span>
				<span class='text'>However, during these discussions, it soon became evident that Wittgenstein held a different attitude towards philosophy than the members of the Circle whom his work had inspired</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, during meetings of the Vienna Circle, he would express his disagreement with the group's misreading of his work by turning his back to them and reading poetry aloud</span>

				<span class='text'>However, he also wrote that &quot;there was a striking difference between Wittgenstein's attitude toward philosophical problems and that of Schlick and myself</span>
				<span class='text'>Our attitude toward philosophical problems was not very different from that which scientists have toward their problems</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; As for Wittgenstein:{{quote|His point of view and his attitude toward people and problems, even theoretical problems, were much more similar to those of a creative artist than to those of a scientist; one might almost say, similar to those of a religious prophet or a seer</span>

				<span class='text'>His sister, Margaret, invited him to help with the design of her new townhouse in Vienna's ''Kundmanngasse''</span>
				<span class='text'>Wittgenstein, his friend [[Paul Engelmann]], and a team of architects developed a spare modernist house</span>
				<span class='text'>In particular, Wittgenstein focused on the windows, doors, and radiators, demanding that every detail be exactly as he specified</span>
				<span class='text'>When the house was nearly finished Wittgenstein had an entire ceiling raised 30mm so that the room had the exact proportions he wanted</span>
				<span class='text'>Monk writes that &quot;This is not so marginal as it may at first appear, for it is precisely these details that lend what is otherwise a rather plain, even ugly house its distinctive beauty</span>

				<span class='text'>In the winter of 1936/7, he delivered a series of &quot;confessions&quot; to close friends, most of them about minor infractions like white lies, in an effort to cleanse himself</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1938, he travelled to Ireland to visit [[Maurice O'Connor Drury]], a friend who became a psychiatrist, and considered such training himself, with the intention of abandoning philosophy for it</span>
				<span class='text'>The visit to Ireland was at the same time a response to the invitation of the then Irish [[Taoiseach]], [[Ã‰amon de Valera]], himself a mathematics teacher</span>
				<span class='text'>De Valera hoped Wittgenstein's presence would contribute to an academy for advanced mathematics</span>
				<span class='text'>hile he was in Ireland in March 1938, Germany annexed Austria in the ''Anschluss''; the Viennese Wittgenstein was now a citizen of the enlarged Germany and a Jew under the [[Nuremberg Laws|1935 Nuremberg racial laws]], because three of his grandparents had been born as Jews</span>
				<span class='text'>The Nuremberg Laws classified people as Jews (''Volljuden'') if they had three or four Jewish grandparents, and as mixed blood (''[[Mischling]]'') if they had one or two</span>
				<span class='text'>It meant ''inter alia'' that the Wittgensteins were restricted in whom they could marry or have sex with, and where they could work</span>

				<span class='text'>The Nazis discovered his relationship with Hilde Schania, a brewer's daughter with whom he had had two children but whom he had never married, though he did later</span>
				<span class='text'>Because she was not Jewish, he was served with a summons for ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (racial defilement)</span>
				<span class='text'>He told no one he was leaving the country, except for Hilde who agreed to follow him</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Norman Malcolm, at the time a post-graduate research fellow at Cambridge, describes his first impressions of Wittgenstein in 1938: {{quote|&quot;At a meeting of the Moral Science Club, after the paper for the evening was read and the discussion started, someone began to stammer a remark</span>
				<span class='text'>He had extreme difficulty in expressing himself and his words were unintelligible to me</span>
				<span class='text'>I whispered to my neighbour, 'Who's that?': he replied, 'Wittgenstein'</span>
				<span class='text'>I was astonished because I had expected the famous author of the ''Tractatus'' to be an elderly man, whereas this man looked ''young'' â€“ perhaps about 35</span>
				<span class='text'>(His actual age was 49</span>
				<span class='text'> His face was lean and brown, his profile was aquiline and strikingly beautiful, his head was covered with a curly mass of brown hair</span>
				<span class='text'>I observed the respectful attention that everyone in the room paid to him</span>
				<span class='text'>After this unsuccessful beginning he did not speak for a time but was obviously struggling with his thoughts</span>
				<span class='text'>His look was concentrated, he made striking gestures with his hands as if he was discoursing</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Whether lecturing or conversing privately, Wittgenstein always spoke emphatically and with a distinctive intonation</span>
				<span class='text'>He spoke excellent English, with the accent of an educated Englishman, although occasional Germanisms would appear in his constructions</span>
				<span class='text'>His voice was resonant</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>His words came out, not fluently, but with great force</span>
				<span class='text'>Anyone who heard him say anything knew that this was a singular person</span>
				<span class='text'>His face was remarkably mobile and expressive when he talked</span>
				<span class='text'>His eyes were deep and often fierce in their expression</span>
				<span class='text'>His whole personality was commanding, even imperial</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>23â€“4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;}}Describing Wittgenstein's lecture program, Malcolm continues: {{quote|&quot;It is hardly correct to speak of these meetings as 'lectures', although this is what Wittgenstein called them</span>
				<span class='text'>For one thing, he was carrying on original research in these meetings</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Often the meetings consisted mainly of dialogue</span>
				<span class='text'>Sometimes, however, when he was trying to draw a thought out of himself, he would prohibit, with a peremptory motion of the hand, any questions or remarks</span>
				<span class='text'>There were frequent and prolonged periods of silence, with only an occasional mutter from Wittgenstein, and the stillest attention from the others</span>
				<span class='text'>During these silences, Wittgenstein was extremely tense and active</span>
				<span class='text'>His gaze was concentrated; his face was alive; his hands made arresting movements; his expression was stern</span>
				<span class='text'>One knew that one was in the presence of extreme seriousness, absorption, and force of intellect</span>

				<span class='text'>Now he denied there were any mathematical facts to be discovered</span>
				<span class='text'>He gave a series of lectures on mathematics, discussing this and other topics, documented in a book, with lectures by Wittgenstein and discussions between him and several students, including the young [[Alan Turing]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He grew angry when any of his students wanted to become professional philosophers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;For his desire that his students not pursue philosophy, see Malcolm, p</span>
				<span class='text'>28&lt;/ref&gt;In September 1941 he asked [[John Ryle (professor)|John Ryle]], the brother of the philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]], if he could get a manual job at [[Guy's Hospital]] in London</span>
				<span class='text'>John Ryle was professor of medicine at Cambridge and had been involved in helping Guy's prepare for [[the Blitz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Wittgenstein told Ryle he would die slowly if left at Cambridge, and he would rather die quickly</span>
				<span class='text'>He started working at Guy's shortly afterwards as a dispensary porter, meaning that he delivered drugs from the pharmacy to the wardsâ€”where he apparently advised the patients not to take them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Monk431/&gt;The hospital staff were not told he was one of the world's most famous philosophers, though some of the medical staff did recognize himâ€”at least one had attended Moral Sciences Club meetingsâ€”but they were discreet</span>

				<span class='text'>432</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Some of them nevertheless called him Professor Wittgenstein, and he was allowed to dine with the doctors</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote on 1 April 1942: &quot;I no longer feel any hope for the future of my life</span>
				<span class='text'>It is as though I had before me nothing more than a long stretch of living death</span>

				<span class='text'>Skinner had given up academia, thanks at least in part to Wittgenstein's influence, and had been working as a mechanic in 1939, with Kirk as his apprentice</span>

				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|Illustration of a &quot;[[Rabbitâ€“duck illusion|duckrabbit]]&quot;, discussed in the ''Philosophical Investigations'', section XI, part II]]The ''[[Blue and Brown Books|Blue Book]]'', a set of notes dictated to his class at Cambridge in 1933â€“1934, contains the seeds of Wittgenstein's later thoughts on language, and is widely read as a turning-point in his philosophy of language</span>
				<span class='text'>'Philosophical Investigations'' was published in two parts in 1953</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of Part I was ready for printing in 1946, but Wittgenstein withdrew the manuscript from his publisher</span>
				<span class='text'>The shorter Part II was added by his editors, Elizabeth Anscombe and Rush Rhees</span>
				<span class='text'>Wittgenstein asks the reader to think of language as a multiplicity of language-games within which parts of language develop and function</span>
				<span class='text'>He argues that philosophical problems are bewitchments that arise from philosophers' misguided attempts to consider the meaning of words independently of their context, usage, and grammar, what he called &quot;language gone on holiday</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;PI, Â§38</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;According to Wittgenstein, philosophical problems arise when language is forced from its proper home into a metaphysical environment, where all the familiar and necessary landmarks and contextual clues are removed</span>
				<span class='text'>He describes this metaphysical environment as like being on frictionless ice: where the conditions are apparently perfect for a philosophically and logically perfect language, all philosophical problems can be solved without the muddying effects of everyday contexts; but where, precisely because of the lack of friction, language can in fact do no work at all</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;PI, Â§107</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein argues that philosophers must leave the frictionless ice and return to the &quot;rough ground&quot; of ordinary language in use</span>
				<span class='text'>Much of the ''Investigations'' consists of examples of how the first false steps can be avoided, so that philosophical problems are dissolved, rather than solved: &quot;the clarity we are aiming at is indeed ''complete'' clarity</span>
				<span class='text'>But this simply means that the philosophical problems should ''completely'' disappear</span>
