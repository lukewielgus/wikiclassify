				<span class='text'>=Early life and education==Born into a lower middle-class Muslim family in the medieval [[Fatimid]] quarter of [[Cairo]] in 1911, Mahfouz was named after Professor [[Naguib Pasha Mahfouz]] (1882â€“1974), the renowned [[Copts|Coptic]] physician who delivered him</span>
				<span class='text'>Mahfouz was the seventh and the youngest child in a family that had five boys and two girls, with fifteen years separating Mahfouz and his next youngest sibling</span>
				<span class='text'>(Experientially, he grew up an &quot;only child</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;) The family lived in two popular districts of Cairo: first, in the Bayt al-Qadi neighborhood in the Gamaleya quarter in the old city, from where they moved in 1924 to Abbaseya, then a new Cairo suburb north of the old city, locations that would provide the backdrop for many of Mahfouz's later writings</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, Abdel-Aziz Ibrahim, whom Mahfouz described as having been &quot;old-fashioned&quot;, was a civil servant, and Mahfouz eventually followed in his footsteps in 1934</span>
				<span class='text'>Mahfouzâ€™s mother, Fatimah, was the daughter of Mustafa Qasheesha, an [[Al-Azhar]] sheikh, and although illiterate herself, took the boy Mahfouz on numerous excursions to cultural locations such as the [[Egyptian Museum]] and the [[Egyptian Pyramids|Pyramids]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;El-Enany7&quot;/&gt;The Mahfouz family were devout Muslims and Mahfouz had a strict Islamic upbringing</span>
				<span class='text'>In an interview, he elaborated on the stern religious climate at home during his childhood</span>
				<span class='text'>He stated that &quot;You would never have thought that an artist would emerge from that family</span>

				<span class='text'>By 1936, having spent a year working on an M</span>

				<span class='text'>Mahfouz then worked as a journalist for al-Risala, and contributed short stories to el-Hilal and [[Al-Ahram]]</span>
				<span class='text'>= Civil service ==After receiving his Bachelor's degree in Philosophy from [[Cairo University]] in 1934, Mahfouz joined the Egyptian civil service, where he continued to work in various positions and ministries until retirement in 1971</span>
				<span class='text'>He served first as a clerk at Cairo University, then, in 1938, in the [[Ministry of Awqaf (Egypt)|Ministry of Islamic Endowments (Awqaf)]] as parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Islamic Endowments</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1945, he requested a transfer to the [[Sultan Al-Ghuri Complex|al-Ghuri Mausoleum]] library, where he interviewed residents of his childhood neighborhood as part of the &quot;Good Loans Project</span>

				<span class='text'>Possibly his most famous work, ''The Cairo Trilogy'', depicts the lives of three generations of different families in Cairo from World War I until after the 1952 military coup that overthrew King Farouk</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a board member of the publisher ''Dar el-Ma'aref''</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of his novels were serialized in ''Al-Ahram'', and his writings also appeared in his weekly column, &quot;Point of View&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>''Abath Al-Aqdar (Mockery of the Fates)'' (1939), ''Rhadopis'' (1943), and ''Kifah Tibah (The Struggle of Thebes)'' (1944), were historical novels, written as part of a larger unfulfilled project of 30 novels</span>
				<span class='text'>Inspired by [[Sir Walter Scott]] (1771â€“1832), Mahfouz planned to cover the entire history of [[Egypt]] in a series of books</span>
				<span class='text'>However, following the third volume, he shifted his interest to the present and the psychological impact of social change on ordinary people</span>

				<span class='text'>spx|work=The American University in Cairo Press|publisher=AUC Press|accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;Mahfouz's prose is characterised by the blunt expression of his ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>His written works covered a broad range of topics, including [[socialism]], [[homosexuality]], and God</span>
				<span class='text'>Writing about some of these subjects was prohibited in Egypt</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;aucp&quot;/&gt; In his works, he described the development of his country in the 20th century and combined intellectual and cultural influences from East and West</span>
				<span class='text'>His own exposure to the literature of non-Egyptian culture began in his youth with the enthusiastic consumption of Western detective stories, Russian classics, and such modernist writers as [[Marcel Proust]], [[Franz Kafka]] and [[James Joyce]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Mahfouz's stories are almost always set in the heavily populated urban quarters of Cairo, where his characters, mostly ordinary people, try to cope with the modernization of society and the temptations of Western values</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;aucp&quot;/&gt;Mahfouz's central work in the 1950s was the ''[[Cairo Trilogy]]'', which he completed before the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|July Revolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The novels were titled with the street names ''[[Palace Walk]]'', ''[[Palace of Desire (novel)|Palace of Desire]]'', and ''[[Sugar Street (Cairo)|Sugar Street]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Mahfouz set the story in the parts of Cairo where he grew up</span>
				<span class='text'>The novels depict the life of the patriarch el-Sayyed Ahmed Abdel Gawad and his family over three generations, from [[World War I]] to the 1950s, when [[King Farouk I]] was overthrown</span>
				<span class='text'>Mahfouz stopped writing for some years after finishing the trilogy</span>
				<span class='text'>Disappointed in the [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] rÃ©gime, which had overthrown the monarchy in 1952, he started publishing again in 1959, now prolifically pouring out novels, short stories, journalism, memoirs, essays, and screenplays</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;aucp&quot;/&gt; He stated in a 1998 interview, he &quot;long felt that Nasser was one of the greatest political leaders in modern history</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;''Tharthara Fawq Al-NÄ«l'' ([[Adrift on the Nile]], 1966) is one of his most popular novels</span>
				<span class='text'>It was later made into a [[Chitchat on the Nile|film]] during the rÃ©gime of [[Anwar al-Sadat]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The story criticizes the decadence of Egyptian society during the Nasser era</span>
				<span class='text'>It was banned by Sadat to avoid provoking Egyptians who still loved former president Nasser</span>
				<span class='text'>Copies were hard to find prior to the late 1990s</span>
				<span class='text'>he ''[[Children of Gebelawi]]'' (1959, also known as ''Children of the Alley'') one of Mahfouz's best known works, portrayed the patriarch Gebelaawi and his children, average Egyptians living the lives of [[Cain]] and [[Abel]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]], and [[Mohammed]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Gebelawi built a mansion in an oasis in the middle of a barren desert; his estate becomes the scene of a family feud that continues for generations</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Whenever someone is depressed, suffering or humiliated, he points to the mansion at the top of the alley at the end opening out to the desert, and says sadly, 'That is our ancestor's house, we are all his children, and we have a right to his property</span>
				<span class='text'>Why are we starving? What have we done?'&quot; The book was banned throughout the Arab world, except in [[Lebanon]], until 2006, when it was first published in Egypt</span>
				<span class='text'>The work was prohibited because of its alleged blasphemy through the allegorical portrayal of God and the [[monotheistic]] [[Abrahamic]] faiths of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n the 1960s, Mahfouz further developed the theme that humanity is moving further away from God in his [[existentialism|existentialist]] novels</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''The Thief and the Dogs'' (1961) he depicted the fate of a [[Marxism|Marxist]] thief, who has been released from prison and plans revenge</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;aucp&quot;/&gt;In the 1960s and 1970s Mahfouz began to construct his novels more freely and to use interior monologues</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Miramar'' (1967) he developed a form of multiple first-person narration</span>
				<span class='text'>Four narrators, among them a Socialist and a Nasserite opportunist, represent different political views</span>
				<span class='text'>In the center of the story is an attractive servant girl</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Arabian Nights and Days'' (1981) and in ''The Journey of Ibn Fatouma'' (1983) he drew on traditional Arabic narratives as subtexts</span>
				<span class='text'>''Akhenaten: Dweller in Truth'' (1985) is about conflict between old and new religious truths</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of his novels were first published in serialized form, including ''Children of Gebelawi'' and ''[[Midaq Alley (novel)|Midaq Alley]]'' which was adapted into a [[cinema of Mexico|Mexican film]] starring [[Salma Hayek]] (''[[El callejÃ³n de los milagros]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>== Political influence ===Most of Mahfouz's writings deal mainly with politics, a fact he acknowledged: &quot;In all my writings, you will find politics</span>
				<span class='text'>You may find a story which ignores love or any other subject, but not politics; it is the very axis of our thinking&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>23</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;He espoused [[Egyptian nationalism]] in many of his works, and expressed sympathies for the post-World-War era [[Wafd Party]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;paris&quot;/&gt; He was also attracted to socialist and democratic ideals early on in his youth</span>
				<span class='text'>The influence of socialist ideals is strongly reflected in his first two novels, Al-Khalili and New Cairo, and also in many of his latter works</span>
				<span class='text'>Parallel to his sympathy for socialism and democracy was his antipathy towards Islamic extremism as expressed by the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in Egypt</span>
				<span class='text'>He strongly criticized radical Islam in his works and contrasted between the merits of [[socialism]] and the demerits of Islamic extremism in his first two novels</span>
				<span class='text'>He perceived Islamism as critically delineated and rejected it as unsuitable for all times</span>
				<span class='text'>In his memoirs, he purportedly stated that of all the forces active in Egyptian politics during his youth, he most despised the Muslim Brotherhood</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;aucp&quot;/&gt;Mahfouz had personally known [[Sayyid Qutb]] in his youth, when the latter was showing a greater interest in literary criticism than in [[Islamic fundamentalism]]; Qutb later became a significant influence on the Muslim Brotherhood</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, Qutb was one of the first critics to recognize Mahfouz's talent in the mid-1940s</span>
				<span class='text'>Mahfouz even visited Qutb when the latter was in the hospital, during the 1960s, near the end of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>In his semi-autobiographical novel, ''Mirrors'', he drew a very negative portrait of Sayyid Qutb</span>
				<span class='text'>He was disillusioned with the 1952 revolution and by Egypt's defeat in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He supported the principles of the revolution but became disenchanted, saying that the practices failed to live up to them</span>
				<span class='text'>aguib Mahfouz influenced a new generation of Egyptian lawyers, including Nabil Mounir and Reda Aslan</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;El-Enany23&quot;/&gt;=== Reception ===Mahfouz has received praise from American reviewers:â€œThe alleys, the houses, the palaces and mosques and the people who live among them are evoked as vividly in Mahfouzâ€™s work as the streets of London were conjured by Dickens</span>
				<span class='text'>€â€”Newsweek&lt;ref name=&quot;aucp&quot;/&gt;â€œThroughout Naguib Mahfouzâ€™s fiction there is a pervasive sense of metaphor, of a literary artist who is using his fiction to speak directly and unequivocally to the condition of his country</span>
				<span class='text'>His work is imbued with love for Egypt and its people, but it is also utterly honest and unsentimental</span>
				<span class='text'>€â€”Washington Post&lt;ref name=&quot;aucp&quot;/&gt;â€œMahfouzâ€™s work is freshly nuanced and hauntingly lyrical</span>
				<span class='text'>The Nobel Prize acknowledges the universal significance of [his] fiction</span>
				<span class='text'>€â€”Los Angeles Times&lt;ref name=&quot;aucp&quot;/&gt;â€œMr</span>
				<span class='text'>Mahfouz embodied the essence of what makes the bruising, raucous, chaotic human anthill of Cairo possible</span>
				<span class='text'>€â€”The Economist&lt;ref name=&quot;aucp&quot;/&gt;=== Nobel Prize for Literature ===Mahfouz was awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in Literature, the only Arab writer to have won the award</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly after winning the prize Mahfouz was quoted as saying &quot;The Nobel Prize has given me, for the first time in my life, the feeling that my literature could be appreciated on an international level</span>
				<span class='text'>The Arab world also won the Nobel with me</span>
				<span class='text'>I believe that international doors have opened, and that from now on, literate people will consider Arab literature also</span>
				<span class='text'>We deserve that recognition</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The Swedish letter to Mahfouz included the quotations &quot;rich and complex work invites us to reconsider the fundamental things in life</span>
				<span class='text'>Themes like the nature of time and love, society and norms, knowledge and faith recur in a variety of situations and are presented in thought-provoking, evocative, and clearly daring ways</span>

				<span class='text'>== Political involvement ===Mahfouz did not shrink from controversy outside of his work</span>
				<span class='text'> As a consequence of his outspoken support for Sadat's [[Camp David Accords|Camp David peace treaty]] with Israel in 1978, his books were banned in many Arab countries until after he won the Nobel Prize</span>
				<span class='text'>Like many Egyptian writers and intellectuals, Mahfouz was on an Islamic fundamentalist &quot;death list&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He defended [[Salman Rushdie]] after Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] condemned Rushdie to death in 1989, but also criticized his ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' as &quot;insulting&quot; to Islam</span>
				<span class='text'>Mahfouz believed in freedom of expression and, although he did not personally agree with Rushdie's work, he did not believe that there should be a ''fatwa'' condemning him to death for it</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1989, after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's ''[[fatwa]]'' calling for [[The Satanic Verses controversy|Salman Rushdie and his publishers to be killed]], Mahfouz called Khomeini a terrorist</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Le Monde'', 8 March 1989&lt;/ref&gt;== Attempted assassination ==The appearance of ''The Satanic Verses'' brought back up the controversy surrounding Mahfouz's novel ''[[Children of Gebelawi]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Death threats against Mahfouz followed, including one from the &quot;blind sheikh,&quot; Egyptian-born [[Omar Abdul-Rahman]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Mahfouz was given police protection, but in 1994 an Islamic extremist succeeded in attacking the 82-year-old novelist by stabbing him in the neck outside his Cairo home</span>
