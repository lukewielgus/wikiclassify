				<span class='text'>His landmark recordings in 1936 and 1937 display a combination of singing, guitar skills, and songwriting talent that has influenced later generations of musicians</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson's shadowy and poorly documented life and [[27 Club|death at age 27]] have given rise to much legend, including the [[Deal with the Devil|Faustian myth]] that he sold his soul to the devil at a [[crossroads (mythology)|crossroads]] to achieve success</span>
				<span class='text'>As an [[wikt:Special:Search/itinerant|itinerant]] performer who played mostly on street corners, in [[juke joint]]s, and at Saturday night dances, Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime</span>
				<span class='text'>t was only after the reissue of his recordings in 1961, on the LP ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]'', that his work reached a wider audience</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson is now recognized as a master of the blues, particularly of the Mississippi [[Delta blues]] style</span>
				<span class='text'>He is credited by many rock musicians as an important influence; [[Eric Clapton]] has called Johnson &quot;the most important blues singer that ever lived</span>

				<span class='text'>Julia was married to Charles Dodds (born February 1865), a relatively prosperous landowner and furniture maker  with whom she had ten children</span>
				<span class='text'>Charles Dodds had been forced by a mob to leave Hazlehurst following a dispute with white landowners</span>
				<span class='text'>Julia left Hazlehurst with baby Robert but after some two years sent him to live in Memphis with her husband, who had changed his name to Charles Spencer</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Guralnik pp</span>
				<span class='text'>10–11&lt;/ref&gt;Circa 1919, Robert rejoined his mother in the Mississippi Delta area around Tunica and Robinsonville, Mississippi</span>
				<span class='text'>Julia's new husband was known as Dusty Willis; he was 24 years her junior</span>
				<span class='text'>Robert was remembered by some residents as &quot;Little Robert Dusty,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Guralnik p</span>
				<span class='text'>11</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; but he was registered at Tunica's Indian Creek School as Robert Spencer</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1920 census he is listed as Robert Spencer, living in Lucas, Arkansas, with Will and Julia Willis</span>
				<span class='text'>Robert was at school in 1924 and 1927&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeland 2000&quot;/&gt; and the quality of his signature on his marriage certificate&lt;ref&gt;Wardlow 1998 p</span>
				<span class='text'>201</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; suggests that he was relatively well educated for a boy of his background</span>
				<span class='text'>One school friend, Willie Coffee, has been discovered and filmed, recalling that Robert was already noted for playing the harmonica and [[Jew's harp|jaw harp]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''Hellhounds on my Trail: The Afterlife of Robert Johnson'' quoted in Wald 2004 p</span>
				<span class='text'>107</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He also remembers that Robert was absent for long periods, which suggests that he may have been living and studying in Memphis</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pearson &amp; McCulloch p</span>
				<span class='text'>6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;After school, Robert adopted the surname of his natural father, signing himself as Robert Johnson on the certificate of his marriage to sixteen-year-old Virginia Travis in February 1929</span>
				<span class='text'>She died in childbirth shortly after</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wald 2004 p</span>
				<span class='text'>108</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Surviving relatives of Virginia told the blues researcher [[Robert &quot;Mack&quot; McCormick]] that this was a divine punishment for Robert's decision to sing secular songs, known as &quot;selling your soul to the Devil&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>McCormick believes that Johnson himself accepted the phrase as a description of his resolve to abandon the settled life of a husband and farmer to become a full-time blues musician</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The Search for Robert Johnson, 1992 film</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Around this time, the blues musician [[Son House]] moved to Robinsonville where his musical partner, [[Willie Brown (musician)|Willie Brown]], lived</span>
				<span class='text'>Late in life, House remembered Johnson as a &quot;little boy&quot; who was a competent harmonica player but an embarrassingly bad guitarist</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after, Johnson left Robinsonville for the area around Martinsville, close to his birthplace Hazlehurst, possibly searching for his natural father</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he perfected the guitar style of Son House and learned other styles from Isaiah &quot;Ike&quot; Zinnerman</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pearson &amp; McCulloch p</span>
				<span class='text'>7&quot;&gt;Pearson &amp; McCulloch p</span>
				<span class='text'>7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Zinnerman was rumored to have learned supernaturally to play guitar by visiting graveyards at midnight</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pearson &amp; McCulloch, p</span>
				<span class='text'>94</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;When Johnson next appeared in Robinsonville, he had seemed to have acquired a miraculous guitar technique</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Guralnick p</span>
				<span class='text'>15</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; House was interviewed at a time when the legend of Johnson's pact with the Devil was well known among blues researchers</span>
				<span class='text'>He was asked whether he attributed Johnson's technique to this pact, and his equivocal answers have been taken as confirmation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Wardlow&quot; /&gt;While living in Martinsville, Johnson fathered a child with Vergie Mae Smith</span>
				<span class='text'>He also married Caletta Craft in May 1931</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1932, the couple moved to Clarksdale, Mississippi, in the Delta</span>
				<span class='text'>Here Caletta died of childbirth and Johnson left for a career as a &quot;walking&quot; or itinerant musician</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pearson &amp; McCulloch p</span>
				<span class='text'>7&quot;/&gt;===Itinerant musician===From 1932 until his death in 1938, Johnson moved frequently between large cities like Memphis, Tennessee, and Helena, Arkansas, and the smaller towns of the Mississippi Delta and neighboring regions of Mississippi and Arkansas</span>

				<span class='text'>2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gioia p</span>
				<span class='text'>172</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, he traveled much farther</span>
				<span class='text'>Fellow blues musician [[Johnny Shines]] accompanied him to Chicago, Texas, New York, Canada, Kentucky, and Indiana</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Neff &amp; Connor p</span>
				<span class='text'>56</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Townsend (musician)|Henry Townsend]] shared a musical engagement with him in St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Townsend p</span>
				<span class='text'>68</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In many places he stayed with members of his large extended family or with women friends</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Guralnik p</span>
				<span class='text'>28</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He did not marry again but formed some long term relationships with women to whom he would return periodically</span>
				<span class='text'>One was Estella Coleman, the mother of the blues musician [[Robert Lockwood, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>] In other places he stayed with a woman seduced at his first performance</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Guralnik p</span>
				<span class='text'>24</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gioia p</span>
				<span class='text'>175</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In each location, Johnson's hosts were largely ignorant of his life elsewhere</span>
				<span class='text'>He used different names in different places, employing at least eight distinct surnames</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gioia pp</span>
				<span class='text'>172-173</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Biographers have looked for consistency from musicians who knew Johnson in different contexts: Shines, who traveled extensively with him; Lockwood who knew him as his mother's partner; [[David &quot;Honeyboy&quot; Edwards]] whose cousin Willie Mae Powell had a relationship with Johnson</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Edwards p</span>
				<span class='text'>100</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; From a mass of partial, conflicting, and inconsistent eye-witness accounts,&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder p</span>
				<span class='text'>22&lt;/ref&gt;  biographers have attempted to summarize Johnson's character</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;He was well mannered, he was soft spoken, he was indecipherable&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Guralnik p</span>
				<span class='text'>29</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; &quot;As for his character, everyone seems to agree that, while he was pleasant and outgoing in public, in private he was reserved and liked to go his own way&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wald p</span>
				<span class='text'>112</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Musicians who knew Johnson testified that he was a nice guy and fairly average—except, of course, for his musical talent, his weakness for whiskey and women, and his commitment to the road</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pearson &amp; McCulloch p</span>
				<span class='text'>111</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;When Johnson arrived in a new town, he would play for tips on street corners or in front of the local barbershop or a restaurant</span>
				<span class='text'>Musical associates have said that in live performances Johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions, but instead pleased audiences by performing more well-known pop standards of the day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query</span>

				<span class='text'>With an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing, Johnson had no trouble giving his audiences what they wanted, and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on Johnson's interest in jazz and country music</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson also had an uncanny ability to establish a rapport with his audience; in every town in which he stopped, Johnson would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later</span>
				<span class='text'>ellow musician Shines was 17 when he met Johnson in 1933</span>
				<span class='text'>He estimated Johnson was maybe a year older than himself</span>
				<span class='text'>In Samuel Charters' ''Robert Johnson'', Shines describes Johnson:{{quote|Robert was a very friendly person, even though he was sulky at times, you know</span>
				<span class='text'>And I hung around Robert for quite a while</span>
				<span class='text'>One evening he disappeared</span>
				<span class='text'>He was kind of a peculiar fellow</span>
				<span class='text'>Robert'd be standing up playing some place, playing like nobody's business</span>
				<span class='text'>At about that time it was a hustle with him as well as a pleasure</span>
				<span class='text'>And money'd be coming from all directions</span>
				<span class='text'>But Robert'd just pick up and walk off and leave you standing there playing</span>
				<span class='text'>And you wouldn't see Robert no more maybe in two or three weeks&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>So Robert and I, we began journeying off</span>
				<span class='text'>I was just, matter of fact, tagging along</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Charters&lt;/ref&gt;}}During this time Johnson established what would be a relatively long-term relationship with Estella Coleman, a woman about 15 years his senior and the mother of musician Robert Lockwood, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson reportedly cultivated a woman to look after him in each town he played in</span>
				<span class='text'>He supposedly asked homely young women living in the country with their families whether he could go home with them, and in most cases he was accepted, until a boyfriend arrived or Johnson was ready to move on</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1941, [[Alan Lomax]] learned from [[Muddy Waters]] that Johnson had performed in the [[Clarksdale, Mississippi]] area</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lomax 1993&lt;/ref&gt; By 1959, historian [[Samuel Charters]] could add only that [[Will Shade]] of the [[Memphis Jug Band]] remembered Johnson had once briefly played with him in [[West Memphis, Arkansas]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Charters 1959&lt;/ref&gt; In the last year of his life, Johnson is believed to have traveled to St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis and possibly Illinois, and then to some states in the East</span>
				<span class='text'> In 1938, [[Columbia Records]] producer [[John H</span>
				<span class='text'>Hammond]], who owned some of Johnson's records, had record producer Don Law seek out Johnson to book him for the first &quot;[[From Spirituals to Swing]]&quot; concert at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York</span>
				<span class='text'>On learning of Johnson's death, Hammond replaced him with [[Big Bill Broonzy]], but still played two of Johnson's records from the stage</span>

				<span class='text'>C</span>
				<span class='text'>Speir]], who ran a general store and doubled as a talent scout</span>
				<span class='text'>Speir put Johnson in touch with Ernie Oertle, who, as a salesman for the ARC group of labels, introduced Johnson to [[Don Law]] to record his first sessions in San Antonio, Texas</span>
				<span class='text'>The recording session was held on November 23, 1936, in room 414 of the [[Gunter Hotel]] in San Antonio,&lt;ref&gt;San Antonio Express-News, November 30, 1986, &quot;Blues wizard's S</span>

				<span class='text'>1-J&lt;/ref&gt; which Brunswick Records had set up to be a temporary recording studio</span>
				<span class='text'>In the ensuing three-day session, Johnson played 16 selections, and recorded alternate takes for most of these</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson reportedly performed facing the wall, which has been cited as evidence he was a shy man and reserved performer</span>
				<span class='text'>This conclusion was played up in the inaccurate liner notes of the 1961 album ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Slide guitarist]] [[Ry Cooder]] speculates that Johnson played facing a corner to enhance the sound of the guitar, a technique he calls &quot;corner loading&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cooder&lt;/ref&gt;Among the songs Johnson recorded in San Antonio were &quot;[[Come On In My Kitchen]]&quot;, &quot;[[Kind Hearted Woman Blues]]&quot;, &quot;[[Dust My Broom|I Believe I'll Dust My Broom]]&quot; and &quot;[[Cross Road Blues]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The first to be released were &quot;[[Terraplane Blues]]&quot; and &quot;Last Fair Deal Gone Down&quot;, probably the only recordings of his that he would live to hear</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Terraplane Blues&quot; became a moderate regional hit, selling 5,000 copies</span>
				<span class='text'>is first recorded song, &quot;Kind Hearted Woman Blues&quot;, was part of a cycle of spin-offs and response songs that began with [[Leroy Carr]]'s &quot;Mean Mistreater Mama&quot; (1934)</span>

				<span class='text'>132– 176</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to most Delta players, Johnson had absorbed the idea of fitting a composed song into the three minutes of a 78 rpm side</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wald 2004 p</span>
				<span class='text'>132</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In 1937, Johnson traveled to Dallas, Texas, for another recording session with Don Law in a makeshift studio at the [[Vitagraph]] (Warner Brothers) Building, 508 Park Avenue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Thor Chistensen| date=November 19, 2011| title=Dallas Church Preserving the Legacy of Robert Johnson| journal=Texas Monthly| url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>==Death===Johnson died on August 16, 1938, at the [[27 Club|age of 27]], near Greenwood, Mississippi</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the cause of death is still unknown, there have been a number of theories offered, based on several differing accounts about the events preceding his death</span>
				<span class='text'> Johnson had been playing for a few weeks at a country dance in a town about {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} from Greenwood</span>
				<span class='text'>According to one theory, Johnson was murdered by the jealous husband of a woman with whom he had flirted</span>
				<span class='text'>In an account by fellow blues legend [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]], Johnson had been flirting with a married woman at a dance, where she gave him a bottle of whiskey [[poison]]ed by her husband</span>
				<span class='text'>When Johnson took the bottle, Williamson knocked it out of his hand, admonishing him to never drink from a bottle that he had not personally seen opened</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson replied, &quot;Don't ever knock a bottle out of my hand</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Soon after, he was offered another (poisoned) bottle and accepted it</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson is reported to have begun feeling ill the evening after and had to be helped back to his room in the early morning hours</span>
				<span class='text'>Over the next three days his condition steadily worsened and witnesses reported that he died in a convulsive state of severe pain</span>
				<span class='text'> Musicologist [[Robert &quot;Mack&quot; McCormick]] claims to have tracked down the man who murdered Johnson, and to have obtained a confession from him in a personal interview, but has declined to reveal the man's name</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''The Search for Robert Johnson'' 1992 film</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;While [[strychnine]] has been suggested as the poison that killed Johnson, at least one scholar has disputed the notion</span>
				<span class='text'> Tom Graves, in his book ''Crossroads: The Life and Afterlife of Blues Legend Robert Johnson'', relies on expert testimony from toxicologists to argue that strychnine has such a distinctive odor and taste that it cannot be disguised, even in strong liquor</span>
				<span class='text'>Graves also claims that a significant amount of strychnine would have to be consumed in one sitting to be fatal, and that death from the poison would occur within hours, not days</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Crossroads: The Life and Afterlife of Blues Legend Robert Johnson|first=Tom |last=Graves|first2= Steve |last2=LaVere|publisher=Demers Books LLC|year=2008 |pages=39–43 |url= |isbn=978-0-9816002-0-8 |quote=The tale most often told about how Johnson met his fate is that he was poisoned by a jealous husband who put strychnine in his whiskey</span>
				<span class='text'>}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- for whole para so far--&gt; Contemporary David &quot;Honeyboy&quot; Edwards similarly noted that the poison could not have been strychnine, since Johnson would have died much more rapidly, instead of suffering for three days</span>
				<span class='text'>n addition, LeFlore County Registrar Cornelia Jordan, after conducting an investigation into Johnson's death for the state director of Vital Statistics, R</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Whitfield, wrote on Johnson's death certificate, &quot;I talked with the white man on whose place this negro died and I also talked with a negro woman on the place</span>
				<span class='text'> The plantation owner said the negro man, seemingly about 26 years old, came from Tunica two or three weeks before he died to play banjo at a negro dance given there on the plantation</span>
				<span class='text'> He stayed in the house with some of the negroes saying he wanted to pick cotton</span>
				<span class='text'> The white man did not have a doctor for this negro as he had not worked for him</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Alleged gravesite showing one of Robert Johnson's three tombstones]]The exact location of his grave is officially unknown; three different markers have been erected at possible church cemetery burial sites outside of Greenwood</span>
				<span class='text'>Research in the 1980s and 1990s strongly suggests Johnson was buried in the graveyard of the Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church near Morgan City, Mississippi, not far from Greenwood, in an unmarked grave</span>
				<span class='text'>A one-ton [[cenotaph]] in the shape of an obelisk, listing all of Johnson's song titles, with a central inscription by [[Peter Guralnick]], was placed at this location in 1990, paid for by Columbia Records and numerous smaller contributions made through the [[Mt</span>
				<span class='text'>Zion Memorial Fund]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1990 a small marker with the epitaph &quot;Resting in the Blues&quot; was placed in the cemetery of Payne Chapel near Quito, Mississippi by an Atlanta rock group named the Tombstones, after they saw a photograph in ''Living Blues'' magazine of an unmarked spot alleged by one of Johnson's ex-girlfriends to be Johnson's burial site</span>

				<span class='text'>Through Stephen LaVere Sony Music has placed a marker at this site which bears LaVere's name as well as Johnson's</span>
				<span class='text'>n interviewee in the documentary ''[[The Search for Robert Johnson]]'' (1991) suggests that owing to poverty and lack of transportation Johnson is most likely to have been buried in a pauper's grave (or &quot;[[Potters field|potter's field]]&quot;) very near where he died</span>
				<span class='text'>=Devil legend==According to legend, as a young man living on a plantation in rural Mississippi, Robert Johnson had a tremendous desire to become a great blues musician</span>
				<span class='text'>He was instructed to take his guitar to a crossroad near [[Dockery Plantation]] at midnight</span>
				<span class='text'>There he was met by a large black man (actually the Devil) who took the guitar and tuned it</span>
				<span class='text'>The Devil played a few songs and then returned the guitar to Johnson, giving him mastery of the instrument</span>
				<span class='text'>This was in effect, a deal with the Devil mirroring the legend of Faust</span>
				<span class='text'>In exchange for his soul, Robert Johnson was able to create the blues for which he became famous</span>
				<span class='text'>==Various accounts===This legend was developed over time, and has been chronicled by [[Gayle Dean Wardlow]],&lt;ref&gt;Wardlow pp</span>
				<span class='text'>196–201&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Komara&lt;ref&gt;Wardlow pp</span>
				<span class='text'>203–4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; and Elijah Wald, who sees the legend as largely dating from Johnson's rediscovery by white fans more than two decades after his death</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wald pp</span>
				<span class='text'>265–276</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Son House]] once told the story to [[Pete Welding]] as an explanation of Johnson's astonishingly rapid mastery of the guitar</span>
				<span class='text'>Welding reported it as a serious belief in a widely read article in ''[[Down Beat]]'' in 1966</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Whelan&lt;/ref&gt; Other interviewers failed to elicit any confirmation from House and there were fully two years between House's observation of Johnson as first a novice and then a master</span>
				<span class='text'>urther details were absorbed from the imaginative retellings by [[Greil Marcus]]&lt;ref&gt;Marcus 1975&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Palmer 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Most significantly, the detail was added that Johnson received his gift from a large black man at a crossroads</span>
				<span class='text'>There is dispute as to how and when the crossroads detail was attached to the Robert Johnson story</span>
				<span class='text'>All the published evidence, including a full chapter on the subject in the biography ''Crossroads'' by Tom Graves, suggests an origin in the story of blues musician [[Tommy Johnson (musician)|Tommy Johnson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This story was collected from his musical associate [[Ishman Bracey]] and his elder brother Ledell in the 1960s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wardlow 1998&lt;/ref&gt; One version of Ledell Johnson's account was published in [[David Evans (musicologist)|David Evans]]'s 1971 biography of Tommy,&lt;ref&gt;Evans 1971&lt;/ref&gt; and was repeated in print in 1982 alongside Son House's story in the widely read ''Searching for Robert Johnson</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;ref&gt;Guralnik 1982&lt;/ref&gt;In another version, Ledell placed the meeting not at a crossroads but in a graveyard</span>
				<span class='text'>This resembles the story told to Steve LaVere that Ike Zinnerman of Hazlehurst, Mississippi learned to play the guitar at midnight while sitting on tombstones</span>

				<span class='text'>Johnson and Ike Zimmerman did practice in a graveyard at night, because it was quiet and no one would disturb them, but it was not the Hazlehurst cemetery as had been believed</span>
				<span class='text'>Zimmerman (his actual name as it was reportedly spelled on census records for the family going back into the early 1800s, his social security card, social security death notice, funeral program, and by his daughters) was not from Hazlehurst but nearby Beauregard, Mississippi</span>
				<span class='text'>And he didn't practice in one graveyard, but in several in the area</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson spent about a year living with and learning from Zimmerman, who ultimately accompanied Johnson back to the Delta to look after him</span>

				<span class='text'>Blues historian Steve Cheseborough writes that it may be impossible to discover the exact location of the mythical crossroads, because &quot;Robert Johnson was a rambling guy&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|alt=|150px|thumb|right|Folklorist [[Alan Lomax]] was instrumental in preserving Johnson's recordings and spreading the mythology around his skill</span>
				<span class='text'>]Some scholars have argued that the devil in these songs may not refer only to the Christian figure of Satan, but also to the African trickster god [[Papa Legba|Legba]], himself associated with crossroads</span>
				<span class='text'>Folklorist Harry M</span>
				<span class='text'>Hyatt wrote that, during his research in the South from 1935–1939, when African-Americans born in the 19th or early-20th century said they or anyone else had &quot;sold their soul to the devil at the crossroads,&quot; they had a different meaning in mind</span>
				<span class='text'>Hyatt claimed there was evidence indicating African religious retentions surrounding Legba and the making of a &quot;deal&quot; (not selling the soul in the same sense as in the Faustian tradition cited by Graves) with this so-called &quot;devil&quot; at the crossroads</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The Blues and the Blues singer has really special powers over women, especially</span>
				<span class='text'> It is said that the Blues singer could possess women and have any woman they wanted</span>
				<span class='text'>And so when Robert Johnson came back, having left his community as an apparently mediocre musician, with a clear genius in his guitar style and lyrics, people said he must have sold his soul to the devil</span>
				<span class='text'> And that fits in with this old African association with the crossroads where you find wisdom: you go down to the crossroads to learn, and in his case to learn in a Faustian pact, with the devil</span>

				<span class='text'>In an essay published in 1999, ''Demythologizing the Blues'', Evans wrote:{{quote|There are&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>several serious problems with this crossroads myth</span>
				<span class='text'>The devil imagery found in the blues is thoroughly familiar from western folklore, and nowhere do blues singers ever mention Legba or any other African deity in their songs or other lore</span>
				<span class='text'>The actual African music connected with cults of Legba and similar trickster deities sounds nothing like the blues, but rather features polyrhythmic percussion and choral call-and-response singing</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Musical style==Robert Johnson is today considered a master of the blues, particularly of the Delta blues style; [[Keith Richards]] of the [[Rolling Stones]] said in 1990, &quot;You want to know how good the blues can get? Well, this is it</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;  But according to [[Elijah Wald]], in his book ''Escaping the Delta'', Johnson in his own time was most respected for his ability to play in such a wide variety of styles—from raw country [[slide guitar]] to jazz and pop licks—and to pick up guitar parts almost instantly upon hearing a song</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wald 2004 p</span>
				<span class='text'>127</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His first recorded song, &quot;Kind Hearted Woman Blues,&quot; in contrast to the prevailing Delta style of the time, more resembled the style of [[Chicago blues|Chicago]] or [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis blues (music)|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Louis]], with &quot;a full-fledged, abundantly varied musical arrangement</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wald 2004 p</span>
				<span class='text'>133</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Unusual for a Delta player of the time, a recording exhibits what Johnson could do entirely outside of a blues style</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;They're Red Hot,&quot; from his first recording session, shows that he was also comfortable with an &quot;uptown&quot; [[swing music|swing]] or [[ragtime]] sound similar to the [[Harlem Hamfats]] but, as Wald remarks, &quot;no record company was heading to Mississippi in search of a down-home [[Ink Spots]] </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[H]e could undoubtedly have come up with a lot more songs in this style if the producers had wanted them</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Myers adds:{{quote|To the uninitiated, Johnson's recordings may sound like just another dusty Delta blues musician wailing away</span>

				<span class='text'>These subtle inflections of [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] help explain why his singing conveys such powerful emotion</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Son House rawness,&quot; but the train imitation on the bridge is not at all typical of Delta blues, and is more like something out of [[minstrel show]] music or [[vaudeville]]</span>

				<span class='text'>139</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson did record versions of &quot;Preaching the Blues&quot; and &quot;Walking Blues&quot; in the older bluesman's vocal and guitar style (House's chronology is questioned by Guralnick)</span>
				<span class='text'>As with the first take of &quot;Come On In My Kitchen,&quot; the influence of Skip James is evident in James's &quot;Devil Got My Woman&quot;, but the lyrics rise to the level of first-rate poetry, and Johnson sings with a strained voice found nowhere else in his recorded output</span>

				<span class='text'>171–172</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The sad, romantic &quot;Love in Vain&quot; successfully blends several of Johnson's disparate influences</span>

				<span class='text'>His influence on contemporaries was much smaller, due in part to the fact that he was an itinerant performer—playing mostly on street corners, in [[juke joint]]s, and at Saturday night dances—who worked in a then undervalued style of music</span>
				<span class='text'>He also died young after recording only a handful of songs</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson, though well-traveled and admired in his performances, was little noted in his lifetime, his records even less so</span>

				<span class='text'>f one had asked black blues fans about Robert Johnson in the first twenty years after his death, writes [[Elijah Wald]], &quot;the response in the vast majority of cases would have been a puzzled 'Robert who?'&quot;  This lack of recognition extended to black musicians: &quot;As far as the evolution of black music goes, Robert Johnson was an extremely minor figure, and very little that happened in the decades following his death would have been affected if he had never played a note&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Wald 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  With the album ''[[King of the Delta Blues Singers]]'', a compilation of Johnson's recordings released in 1961, [[Columbia Records]] introduced his work to a much wider audience—fame and recognition he only received long after his death</span>
