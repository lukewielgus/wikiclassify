				<span class='text'>= Biography ===== Family background and early life ===[[File:Cremona centro</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Panorama of Cremona, with the [[Torrazzo di Cremona]] prominent]]Antonio Stradivari‚Äôs birthdate, presumably between 1644 and 1649, has been debated amongst historians due to the numerous inconsistencies in the evidence of the latter</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1668 and 1678 censuses report him actually growing younger, a fact explained by the probable loss of statistics from 1647‚Äì49, when renewed belligerency between France‚Äôs Modenese and Spain‚Äôs Milanese proxies led to a flow of refugees that included Stradivari‚Äôs mother</span>
				<span class='text'>tradivari's ancestry consisted of notable citizens of [[Cremona]], dating back to at least the 12th or 13th century</span>
				<span class='text'>The earliest mention of the family name, or a variation upon it, is in a [[land grant]] dating from 1188</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hill et al (1963), p</span>
				<span class='text'>3&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the name itself has several possible explanations; some sources say it is the plural of ''Stradivare'', essentially meaning &quot;[[toll road|toll]]-man&quot; in [[Lombards|Lombard]], while others say that the form &quot;de Strataverta&quot; derives from ''Strada averta'', which, in Cremonese dialect means &quot;open road</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fuller-Maitland et al (1922), p</span>
				<span class='text'>707&lt;/ref&gt;Antonio's parents were Alessandro Stradivari, son of Giulio Cesare Stradivari, and Anna [[House of Moroni|Moroni]], daughter of Leonardo Moroni</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Chapin, Anna Alice</span>
				<span class='text'>''The Heart of Music: The Story of the Violin</span>
				<span class='text'>' New York: Dodd, Mead and Co</span>
				<span class='text'> 1921</span>
				<span class='text'>268</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; They married on 30 August 1622, and had at least three children between 1623 and 1628: Giuseppe Giulia Cesare, Carlo Felice, and Giovanni Battista</span>
				<span class='text'>The baptismal records of the parish of S</span>
				<span class='text'>Prospero then stop, and it is unknown whether they had any children from 1628 to 1644</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hill et al (1963), p</span>
				<span class='text'>4&lt;/ref&gt; This blank in the records may be due to the family leaving Cremona in response to war, famine, and plague in the city from 1628 to 1630,&lt;ref&gt;Hill et al (1963), p</span>
				<span class='text'>6&lt;/ref&gt; or the records may have been lost due to clerical reforms imposed by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] of Austria in 1788</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollens (2010), p</span>
				<span class='text'>11&lt;/ref&gt; The latter explanation is supported by the word ''Cremonensis'' (of Cremona) on many of Stradivari's labels, which suggests that he was born in the city instead of merely moving back there to work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pollens (2010), p</span>
				<span class='text'>12&lt;/ref&gt; Antonio was born in 1644, a fact deducible from later violins</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Faber26&quot;&gt;Faber (2006), p</span>
				<span class='text'>26&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are no records or information available on his early childhood, and the first evidence of his presence in Cremona is the label of his oldest surviving violin from 1666</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Faber (2006) p</span>
				<span class='text'>25&lt;/ref&gt;Stradivari likely began an [[apprenticeship]] with [[Nicol√≤ Amati]] between the ages of 12 and 14,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill27&quot;&gt;Hill et al (1963), p</span>
				<span class='text'>27&lt;/ref&gt; although a minor debate surrounds this fact</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the few pieces of evidence supporting this is the label of his 1666 violin, which reads, ''Alumnus Nicolai Amati, faciebat anno 1666''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hill26&quot;&gt;Hill et al (1963), p</span>
				<span class='text'>26&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stradivari did not repeatedly put Amati's name on his labels, unlike many of his other students</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hill et al (1963), p</span>
				<span class='text'>25&lt;/ref&gt; Stradivari's early violins actually bear less of a resemblance to those of Amati than his later instruments do</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Faber26&quot; /&gt; M</span>
				<span class='text'>Chanot-Chardon, a well-known French luthier, asserted that his father had a label of Stradivari's stating, &quot;Made at the age of thirteen, in the workshop of Nicol√≤ Amati&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>This label has never been found or confirmed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hill26&quot; /&gt; Amati would also have been a logical choice for Antonio's parents, as he represented an old family of violin makers in Cremona, and was far superior to most other luthiers in Italy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hill27&quot; /&gt;An alternative theory is that Stradivari started out as a woodworker: the house he lived in from 1667 to 1680 was owned by Francesco Pescaroli, a woodcarver and inlayer</span>
				<span class='text'>Stradivari may even have been employed to decorate some of Amati's instruments, without being a true apprentice</span>
				<span class='text'>This theory is supported by some of Stradivari's later violins, which have elaborate decorations and [[purfling]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Faber (2006), p</span>
				<span class='text'>27&lt;/ref&gt;Assuming that Stradivari was a student of Amati, he would have begun his apprenticeship in 1656‚Äì58 and produced his first decent instruments in 1660, at the age of 16</span>
				<span class='text'>His first labels were printed from 1660 to 1665, which indicates that his work had sufficient quality to be offered directly to his patrons</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he probably stayed in Amati's workshop until about 1684, using his master's reputation as a launching point for his career</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hill et al (1963), p</span>
				<span class='text'>28&lt;/ref&gt;=== First marriage ===[[File:Stradivari house</span>
				<span class='text'>ng|thumb|200px|Antonio Stradivari's second house, at No</span>
				<span class='text'>2 Piazza San Domenico]]Stradivari married his first wife, Francesca Ferraboschi, on 4 July 1667</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hill et al (1963), p</span>
				<span class='text'>8&lt;/ref&gt; Francesca was the young widow of the [[wiktionary:burgher|burgher]] Giacomo Capra, with whom she had two children, and who had been shot by Francesca's brother on the Piazza Garibaldi (formerly the Piazza Santa Agata) by a crossbow</span>
				<span class='text'>He was later exiled, though allowed to return to Cremona many years later</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Faber (2006), p</span>
				<span class='text'>28&lt;/ref&gt; After their marriage, Stradivari moved into a house known as the Casa del Pescatore, or the Casa Nuziale, in his wife's [[parish]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A clue to how they would have met lies in the 1659 Easter census, which lists the Ferraboschi family four houses away from the Amati residence</span>
				<span class='text'>The couple had a daughter, Giulia Maria, three to four months later</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hill et al 1963, p</span>
				<span class='text'>10&quot;&gt;Hill et al (1963), p</span>
				<span class='text'>10&lt;/ref&gt; They remained in the house until 1680, during which time they had four more children: Catterina, Francesco, Alessandro, and [[Omobono Stradivari]], as well as an infant son who lived for only a week</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Fuller-Maitland et al (1922), p</span>
				<span class='text'>708&lt;/ref&gt; It is to be noted that an age difference of four to nine years was uncommon between wedded couples at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>tradivari purchased a house now known as No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 Piazza Roma (formerly No</span>
				<span class='text'>2 Piazza San Domenico) around 1680 for the sum of 7000 lire, 2000 of which he paid at the time of the purchase</span>
				<span class='text'>The totality of the house was paid for by 1684</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hill et al 1963, p</span>
				<span class='text'>10&quot; /&gt; The residense was just doors away from those of several other violin making families of Cremona, including the [[Amati]]s and [[Guarneri]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;Pollens (2010), p</span>
				<span class='text'>22&lt;/ref&gt; Stradivari probably worked in the loft and attic, and he stayed in this house for the rest of his life</span>

				<span class='text'>0&lt;/ref&gt;===Second marriage===Stradivari married his second wife, Antonia Maria Zambelli, on 24 August 1699</span>
				<span class='text'>The only information known about her is that she was 35 at the time of the marriage</span>
				<span class='text'>They had five children from 1700 to 1708&amp;mdash;Francesca Maria, Giovanni Battista Giuseppe, Giovanni Battista Martino, Giuseppe Antonio, and Paolo</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pollens 2010, p</span>
				<span class='text'>26&quot; /&gt;===Death===Stradivari died on 18 December 1737, aged 93</span>
				<span class='text'>He is buried in the Church of San Domenico</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Faber (2006), p</span>
				<span class='text'>59&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb was acquired 8 years prior to his death, having bought it from a Cremonese family, substituting their name for his in the tombstone</span>
				<span class='text'>==Will===His will, dated 1729, is one of the closest approximations we can give to how Stradivari ran his family</span>
				<span class='text'>Counting his wife, there were eight living heirs at the time Stradivari wrote the draft</span>
				<span class='text'>Zambelli was left with her clothing, half of her jewelry, bed linens and household items</span>
				<span class='text'>Antonio declared she would become the responsibility of his two eldest sons</span>
				<span class='text'>As for Annnunciata Caterina, Antonio left her jewelry, income on loans, clothing and linens</span>
				<span class='text'>Paolo, the youngest child, was to get six finished violins as well as some household effects and cash</span>
				<span class='text'>Three other children who had joined religious orders were left with their share of inheritance</span>
				<span class='text'>Maria, a nun, would get an annuity, Alessandro, a priest, would get fixed income on a home mortgage loan and Giuseppe, another priest would get some income on half a share from a pastry shop</span>
				<span class='text'>There were also annual payments to his two sons of 150 and 300 lire each, 170 lire for Annunciata as well as 100 for Francesca</span>
				<span class='text'>To put this into perspective, six violins were valued at approximately 1000 lire, or about 150 lire each</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Shoenbaum, David, The Violin: A Social History of the World's Most Versatile Instrument, Norton, 2013, p</span>
				<span class='text'>0&lt;/ref&gt;We are now left with two sons from Antonio‚Äôs first marriage who worked in the family shop: Omobono and Franceso</span>
				<span class='text'>As Omobono had left the dwelling aged eighteen in search of new employment possibilities in Naples, he left Antonio to pay for much of his living expenses</span>
				<span class='text'>In this sense, his father had never really forgiven him for leaving home</span>
				<span class='text'>Just as Paolo, he would inherit six violins</span>
				<span class='text'>That was all that was written on the will for him</span>
				<span class='text'>As For Francesco, who was named his father‚Äôs successor, he would inherit the rest of his father‚Äôs belongings, the rest of the estate</span>
				<span class='text'>This included all of the wood tools, stencils, finished violins, patterns, not to mention, his father‚Äôs reputation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Shoenbaum, David, The Violin: A Social History of the World's Most Versatile Instrument, Norton, 2013, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1&lt;/ref&gt;Many events in the family‚Äôs history testify to the substantial wealth Antonio generated</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, in 1733, Stradivari bought his youngest son a partnership in a local textile firm for the large amount of 25,000 lire</span>
				<span class='text'>In comparison, he had bought his house in 1680 for 7,000 lire</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, allowing mild inflation, Antonio made a loan of 12,000 lire in 1714</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1715, under unknown circumstances, Giuseppe Guarneri borrowed 1,000 lire from Stradivari and later defaulted on the loan</span>
				<span class='text'>Giuseppe worked almost all his life in Stradivari's shadow, just as his father, the elder Giuseppe filius Andreae did</span>
				<span class='text'>=Career=====Early career===Stradivari likely developed his own style slowly</span>
				<span class='text'>His violins often used slightly smaller dimensions</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} A notable exception to this is the 1697 ''[[Hellier Stradivarius|Hellier]]'' violin, which had much larger proportions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hill et al (1963), p</span>
				<span class='text'>33&lt;/ref&gt; Stradivari's early (pre-1684) violins are in strong contrast to Amati's instruments from the same time period; Stradivari's have a stronger, more masculine build, and less rounded curves, with the [[purfling]] set farther in</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hill et al (1963), p</span>
				<span class='text'>34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollens (2010), p</span>
				<span class='text'>16&lt;/ref&gt;By 1680, Stradivari had acquired at least a small, yet growing, reputation</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1682, a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] banker ordered a complete set of instruments, which he planned to present to King [[James II of England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hill36-37&quot;&gt;Hill et al (1963) pp</span>
				<span class='text'>36‚Äì37&lt;/ref&gt; The fate of these instruments is unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Cosimo de' Medici]] bought another five years later</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Faber (2006), p</span>
				<span class='text'>41&lt;/ref&gt; Amati died in 1684, an event followed by a noticeable increase in Stradivari's production</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hill36-37&quot; /&gt; The years 1684 and 1685 also marked an important development in his style ‚Äì the dimensions he used generally increased, and his instruments were more in the style of Amati's work of the 1640s and 1650s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hill et al (1963), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>37‚Äì38&lt;/ref&gt; Stradivari's instruments underwent no major change in the next five years,&lt;ref&gt;Hill et al (1963), p</span>
				<span class='text'>39&lt;/ref&gt; although in 1688 he began cutting a more distinct [[bevel]] and began outlining the heads of instruments in black, a quite original improvement</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hill et al (1963), p</span>
				<span class='text'>40&lt;/ref&gt;Stradivari's early career is marked by wide experimentation, and his instruments during this period are generally considered of a lesser quality than his later work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Faber (2006), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>29‚Äì30&lt;/ref&gt; However, the precision with which he carved the heads and inserted the purfling quickly marked him as one of the most dextrous craftsmen in the world, a prime example of this being the 1690 &quot;Tuscan&quot; violin</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hill et al (1963), p</span>
				<span class='text'>41&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-1690 instruments are sometimes termed &quot;Amatis√©&quot; but this is not completely accurate; it is largely because Stradivari created many more instruments later on that people try to connect his early work with Amati's style</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Petherick (1900), p</span>
				<span class='text'>13&lt;/ref&gt;By 1680 Stradivari moved to No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 Piazza Roma (formally No</span>
				<span class='text'>2 Piazza San Domenico)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Hill et al 1963, p</span>
				<span class='text'>10&quot; /&gt; The house was just doors away from those of several other violin making families of Cremona, including the [[Amati]]s and [[Guarneri]]s</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; Stradivari probably worked in the loft and attic, and he stayed in this house for the rest of his life</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt;=== &quot;Golden&quot; period and later years ===In the early 1690s, Stradivari made a pronounced departure from this earlier style of instrument-making, changing two key elements of his instruments</span>
				<span class='text'>First, he began to make violins with a larger pattern than previous instruments; these larger violins usually are known as &quot;Long Strads&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hill et al (1963), p</span>
				<span class='text'>149&lt;/ref&gt; He also switched to using a darker, richer varnish, as opposed to a yellower varnish similar to that used by Amati</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hill et al (1963), p</span>
				<span class='text'>45&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to use this pattern until 1698, with few exceptions</span>
				<span class='text'>After 1698, he abandoned the Long Strad model and returned to a slightly shorter model, which he used until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>The period from 1700 until the 1720s is often termed the &quot;golden period&quot; of his production</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Hart (1875), p</span>
				<span class='text'>131&lt;/ref&gt; Instruments made during this time are usually considered of a higher quality than his earlier instruments</span>
				<span class='text'>Late-period instruments made from the late 1720s until his death in 1737 show signs of Stradivari's advancing age</span>
				<span class='text'>These late instruments may be a bit less beautiful than the Golden Period instruments, but many nonetheless possess a fine tone</span>

				<span class='text'>hey exerted influence not only on one another, in terms of the shape, varnish and sound of instruments, but also on many of their contemporaries; they defined violin making standards for the next 300 years</span>
				<span class='text'>¬´ At [Cremona's] heart is a tract of seventeen houses, on both sides of a street where Amatis, Stradivaris, Guarneris, Bergonzis, Rugeris, Storionis, and Cerutis coexisted</span>
				<span class='text'>ª &lt;ref&gt;Shoenbaum, David, The Violin: A Social History of the World's Most Versatile Instrument, Norton, 2013, p</span>
				<span class='text'>7&lt;/ref&gt;Even at the beginning of the 18th century, Stradivari‚Äôs influence could be seen not only in the work of Cremonese makers, but also international ones, such as Barak Norman‚Äôs, one of the first important British makers</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1720s Daniel Parker, a very important British luthier, produced fine violins after Stradivari‚Äôs work selling anywhere from ¬£30,000 - ¬£60,000 in recent auctions</span>
				<span class='text'>Parker based his best instruments on Stradivari's` `long pattern`, having the opportunity to study one or more of the instruments</span>
				<span class='text'>Well into the 19th century, Jean Baptiste Vuillaume, the leading French luthier of his time, also made many important copies of Strads and Guarneris</span>
				<span class='text'>n the 18th century, Cremonese luthiers were the suppliers and local players on the demand side</span>
				<span class='text'>After Stradivari‚Äôs death, this drastically changed</span>
				<span class='text'>Although the Cremonese luthiers remained the suppliers, the demand side consisted of collectors, researchers, imitators, profiteers and speculators</span>
				<span class='text'>Many local players could no longer afford the sought out instruments and most of the purchased instruments would be hidden in private collections, put in museums, or would be simply put back in their cases, hoping that they would gain value over time</span>
				<span class='text'>It is then that the so-called ‚Äòfever‚Äô for Stradivaris took off</span>
				<span class='text'>Cozio, Tarisio and Vuillaume were the fathers of this frenzy that would extend well into the 21st century</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, soon after Stradivari‚Äôs death, most of the other major Cremonese luthiers would die, putting an end to the golden period of Cremona‚Äôs violin making, which lasted more than 150 years, starting with the Amatis and ending with the Cerutis</span>
				<span class='text'>embers of the Gagliano family such as Gennaro and Nicolo made excellent copies of the instruments in the 1740s, though the only similarity to Stradivari's instruments were the execution of the form and arching as well as consistently fine and detailed varnish</span>
				<span class='text'>Nicolo would usually use the forma B model for his cellos and as the quality of the output steadily declined within the family, the Stradivari models were almost abandoned in Naples</span>
				<span class='text'>aving acquired many Strads from Paolo Stradivari, Count Cozio commissioned some replicas of the instruments to Giovanni Battista Guadagnini</span>
				<span class='text'>Although many features of Strads are present in the copies, they still remain heavily influenced by Guadagnini's workshop principles and represent well the maker's Turin period</span>
				<span class='text'>incenzo Panormo was also one of the many luthiers who based many of his violins on Strads</span>
				<span class='text'>He learned about them in Paris around 1779 and 1789 when he worked closely with L√©opold Renaudin, another one of Strad's followers</span>
				<span class='text'>Stradivari's influence could also be seen in Spain with the outstanding work of Jos√© Contreras of Granada and Madrid</span>
				<span class='text'>Having the privilege to be exposed to Stradivari's instruments through the Spanish court, he was experienced enough to replace the scroll of a 1717 Stradivari cello and possibly even make its back and ribs</span>
				<span class='text'>He had a great ability to imitate the original varnish and intricacy of the instrument</span>

				<span class='text'>Some of the most important luthiers from this part of history include Rota and Chanot</span>
				<span class='text'>This century was home to the many experimental violins from Francois Chanot and William Sidney Mount (non-Italian makers)</span>
				<span class='text'>he 20th century was the so-called rebirth of Cremonese making, when luthiers such as Rocca, Morassi, Beltrami, Antoniazzi emerged from a seemingly uneventful and experimental period</span>
				<span class='text'>These makers, sometimes basing their early violins on Strads, would later on make their own models and would inspire each other‚Äôs work</span>

				<span class='text'>ng|330 √ó 225px|none|center|The Cremonese violin making school]]It is important to know that Nicolo Amati died in 1684, and not in 1630, as indicated on the tree</span>
				<span class='text'>==Stradivari and his sons===Even though Antonio had a very long working life, it is impossible for him to have crafted more than 1000 instruments entirely by himself, meaning that his sons, Francesco and Omobono, as well as possibly a third son, must have been working on and off in his shop</span>
				<span class='text'>We know that having left the workshop at eighteen, Omobono made a few instruments on his own, such as the newly discovered ‚ÄòBlagrove‚Äô and another violin dating from 1732</span>
				<span class='text'>On his side, Francesco made very few violins independently, such as the 1742 ‚ÄòSalabue‚Äô and ‚ÄòOliveira‚Äô, spending his lifetime in his father‚Äôs shop</span>
				<span class='text'>This was one of the main reasons that Francesco had a large part in Antonio‚Äôs will, and Omobono a lesser one</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the major differences between Antonio and his sons' craftsmanship was the quality of the purfling on their instruments</span>
				<span class='text'>Francesco and Omobono are referred to as being &quot;startlingly poor&quot; by John Dilworth in an online article on Tarisio</span>
