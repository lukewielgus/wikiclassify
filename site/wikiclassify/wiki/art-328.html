				<span class='text'>A shrewd politician, Adenauer was deeply committed to a Western-oriented [[Foreign relations of Germany|foreign policy]] and restoring the position of West Germany on the world stage</span>
				<span class='text'>He worked to restore the [[Economic history of Germany#Economic miracle and beyond|West German economy]] from the destruction of World War II to a central position in [[Europe]], presiding over the [[Wirtschaftswunder|German Economic Miracle]]</span>

				<span class='text'>1880</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the formative influences of Adenauer's youth was the ''[[Kulturkampf]]'', an experience that as related to him by his parents left him with a lifelong dislike for &quot;Prussianism&quot;, and led him like many other Catholic Rhinelanders of the 19th century to deeply resent the Rhineland's inclusion in Prussia</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Roy ''Portraits and Miniatures'', London: Bloomsbury Reader, 2012 p</span>
				<span class='text'>81&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, he completed his [[Abitur]] and started to study law and politics at the universities of [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]], [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]] and [[University of Bonn|Bonn]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a member of several [[Roman Catholic]] students' associations under the [[Katholischer Studentenverein Arminia Bonn|K</span>

				<span class='text'>Arminia Bonn]] in Bonn</span>
				<span class='text'>He graduated in 1900&lt;ref name=oryx /&gt; and afterwards worked as a lawyer at the court in Cologne</span>
				<span class='text'>Adenauer had ill health as a young man and was rejected for military service at age 20 because of his lungs</span>
				<span class='text'>He was greatly interested in the use of medicinal herbs, according to famous French herbalist Maurice Messugue, whom he met and befriended</span>
				<span class='text'>Adenauer credited his strong health in older age to the use of an infusion of barley water taken at night, but also maize stigma, mallow, sage, and yellow roses, which he used for coughs he was prone to</span>
				<span class='text'>These were his favourite medicinal plants according to Messugue, though he had extensive knowledge of a wide range of plants</span>
				<span class='text'>He agreed with MM that plants had to be free of sprays and not grown too artificially</span>
				<span class='text'> He told Messugue that he owed his good health to &quot;the plants, to nature</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Adenauer found relaxation and great enjoyment in the Italian game of [[bocce]] and spent a great deal of his post political career playing this game</span>
				<span class='text'>His favorite holiday place to do this was in [[Cadenabbia]], Italy, in a rented villa overlooking Lake Como, which has since been acquired as a conference centre by the [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation|Konrad Adenauer Stiftung]], the political foundation established by Adenauer's political party [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union (CDU)]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|In [[Wilhelmshaven]] in 1928, when a new cruiser was given the name of Adenauer's (centre, with left hand visible) town ''Köln'']]As a devout Catholic, he joined the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] in 1906 and was elected to Cologne's city council in the same year</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1909, he became Vice-Mayor of Cologne, an industrial metropolis with a population of 635,000 in 1914</span>
				<span class='text'>Avoiding the extreme political movements that attracted so many of his generation, Adenauer was committed to bourgeois common-sense, diligence, order, Christian morals and values, and was dedicated to rooting out disorder, inefficiency, irrationality and political immorality</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Schwarz Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>|1995|p=94}} From 1917 to 1933, he served as Mayor of Cologne and became qua office a member of the [[Prussian House of Lords]]</span>
				<span class='text'>denauer headed Cologne during [[World War I]], working closely with the army to maximize the city's role as a rear base of supply and transportation for the Western Front</span>
				<span class='text'>He paid special attention to the civilian food supply, enabling the residents to avoid the worst of the severe shortages that beset most German cities during 1918–1919</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Schwarz Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>|1995|pp=97-99}} In the face of the collapse of the old regime and the threat of revolution and widespread disorder in late 1918, Adenauer maintained control in Cologne using his good working relationship with the Social Democrats</span>
				<span class='text'>In a speech on 1 February 1919 Adenauer called for the dissolution of Prussia, and for the Prussian Rhineland to become a new autonomous ''Land'' (state) in the ''Reich''</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Epstein|1967|p=539}} Adenauer claimed this was the only way to prevent France from annexing the Rhineland</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Epstein|1967|p=539}} Both the ''Reich'' and Prussian governments were totally against Adenauer's plans for breaking up Prussia</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Epstein|1967|pp=539-540}} When the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] were presented to Germany in June 1919, Adenauer again suggested to Berlin his plan for an autonomous Rhineland state and again his plans were rejected by the ''Reich'' government</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Epstein|1967|pp=540-541}}He was mayor during the postwar British occupation</span>
				<span class='text'>He established a good working relationship with the British military authorities, using them to neutralize the workers' and soldiers' council that had become an alternative base of power for the city's left wing</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Schwarz Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>|1995|pp=128-131}} During the [[Weimar Republic]], he was president of the Prussian State Council (Preußischer Staatsrat) from 1921 to 1933, which was the representation of the [[provinces of Prussia]] in its legislation</span>
				<span class='text'>Since 1906, a major debate within the ''Zentrum'' concerned the question if the ''Zentrum'' should &quot;leave the tower&quot; (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>allow Protestants to join to become a multi-faith party) or &quot;stay in the tower&quot; (i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>continue to be a Catholic only party)</span>
				<span class='text'>Adenauer was one of the leading advocates of &quot;leaving the tower&quot;, which led to a dramatic clash between him and Cardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] at the 1922 ''Katholikentag'', where the Cardinal publicly admonished Adenauer for wanting to take the ''Zentrum'' &quot;out of the tower&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Mitchell|2012|p=20}}In mid-October 1923, the Chancellor [[Gustav Stresemann]] announced that Berlin would cease all financial payments to the Rhineland and that the new [[German Rentenmark|''Rentemark'']], which had replaced the now worthless ''Mark'' would not circulate in the Rhineland</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Epstein|1967|pp=541-542}} To save the Rhineland economy, Adenauer opened talks with the French High Commissioner [[Paul Tirard]] in late October 1923 for a Rhenish republic in a sort of economic union with France which would achieve Franco-German reconciliation, which Adenauer called a &quot;grand design&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Epstein|1967|p=542}} At the same time, Adenauer clung to the hope that the ''Rentemark'' might still circulate in the Rhineland</span>
				<span class='text'>Adenauer's plans came to nought when Stresemann, who was resolutely opposed to Adenauer's &quot;grand design&quot;, which he viewed as borderline treason, was able to negotiate an end to the crisis on his own</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Epstein|1967|p=542}}In 1926, the ''Zentrum'' suggested that Adenauer become Chancellor, an offer that he was interested in, but in the end he rejected when the [[German People's Party]] insisted that one of the conditions for entering into a coalition under Adenauer's leadership was that [[Gustav Stresemann]] stay on as Foreign Minister</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;[[Jenkins, Roy]] ''Portraits and Miniatures'', London: [[Bloomsbury Reader]], 2012 page 88&lt;/ref&gt; Adenauer who disliked Stresemann as &quot;too Prussian&quot; rejected that condition, which marked the end of his chance of becoming Chancellor in 1926</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Roy ''Portraits and Miniatures'', London: Bloomsbury Reader, 2012 pages 81 &amp; 88&lt;/ref&gt;In 1932 Adenauer invited the American writer Ruth Gruber to the Mayor's Office where he presented her with two books in honor of her having been awarded the Doctorate of Philosophy at age 20</span>

				<span class='text'>It is now a museum</span>
				<span class='text'>]Election gains of Nazi Party candidates in municipal, state and national elections in 1930 and 1932 were significant</span>
				<span class='text'>Adenauer, as mayor of Cologne and president of the Prussian State Council, still believed that improvements in the national economy would make his strategy work: ignore the Nazis and concentrate on the Communist threat</span>
				<span class='text'>Adenauer thought the Nazis should be part of the Prussian and ''Reich'' governments based on election returns, even when he was already the target of intense personal attacks</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Williams, p</span>
				<span class='text'>201</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Political manoeuvrings around the aging [[President Hindenburg]] then brought the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] to power on 30 January 1933</span>
				<span class='text'>y early February Adenauer finally realized that all talk and all attempts at compromise with the Nazis were futile</span>
				<span class='text'>Cologne's city council and the Prussian parliament had been dissolved; on 4 April 1933, he was officially dismissed as mayor and his bank accounts frozen</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;He had no money, no home and no job</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p</span>
				<span class='text'>212</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; After arranging for the safety of his family, he appealed to the abbot of the Benedictine monastery at [[Maria Laach Abbey|Maria Laach]] for a stay of several months</span>
				<span class='text'>According to [[Albert Speer]] in his book ''[[Spandau: The Secret Diaries]]'', Hitler expressed admiration for Adenauer, noting his civic projects, the building of a road circling the city as a bypass, and a &quot;green belt&quot; of parks</span>
				<span class='text'>However, both Hitler and Speer concluded that Adenauer's political views and principles made it impossible for him to play any role in Nazi Germany</span>
				<span class='text'>denauer was imprisoned for two days after the [[Night of the Long Knives]] on 30 June 1934, but already on 10 August 1934, manoeuvring for his pension, he wrote a 10-page letter to [[Hermann Göring]] (the Prussian interior minister) stating among other things that as Mayor he had even violated Prussian laws in order to allow NSDAP events in public buildings and Nazi flags to be flown from city flagpoles, and added that in 1932 he had declared publicly that the Nazis should join the Reich government in a leading role</span>

				<span class='text'>e/spiegel/print/d-13521797</span>
				<span class='text'>tml}}&lt;/ref&gt;During the next two years, Adenauer changed residences often for fear of reprisals against him, while living on the benevolence of friends</span>
				<span class='text'>With the help of lawyers in August 1937 he was successful in claiming a pension; he received a cash settlement for his house, which had been taken over by the city of Cologne; his unpaid mortgage, penalties and taxes were waived</span>
				<span class='text'>With reasonable financial security he managed to live in seclusion for some years</span>
				<span class='text'>After the [[July 20 Plot|failed assassination attempt on Hitler]] in 1944, he was imprisoned for a second time as an opponent of the regime</span>
				<span class='text'>He fell ill and credited Eugen Zander, a former municipal worker in Cologne and communist, with saving his life</span>
				<span class='text'>Zander, then a section [[Kapo (concentration camp)|Kapo]] of a labor camp near Bonn discovered Adenauer's name on a deportation list to the East and managed to get him admitted to a hospital</span>
				<span class='text'>Adenauer was subsequently rearrested (and so was his wife), but in the absence of any evidence against him was released from prison at [[Brauweiler Abbey|Brauweiler]] in November 1944</span>
				<span class='text'>==After World War II and the founding of the CDU===Shortly after the war ended, the American occupation forces once again installed him as [[Mayor of Cologne]], which had been heavily bombed</span>
				<span class='text'>After the city was transferred into the British zone of occupation, however, the Director of its military government, General [[Gerald Templer]], dismissed Adenauer for incompetence in December 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Schwarz Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>|1995|pp=322-323}} The probable reason for this was that Adenauer considered the Germans the equals of the occupying Allies, a view the British did not appreciate, resulting in his sacking</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Schwarz Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>|1995|pp=321-323}} Adenauer's dismissal by the British contributed much to his subsequent political success and allowed him to pursue a policy of alliance with the West in the 1950s without facing charges of being a &quot;sell-out&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>fter being dismissed, Adenauer devoted himself to building a new political party, the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU), which he hoped would embrace both [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and Roman Catholics in a single party, and thereby achieve his long-standing goal of bringing the ''Zentrum'' &quot;out of the tower&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Adenauer, a catholic-only party would lead to German politics being dominated by anti-democratic parties yet again</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Schwarz Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>|1995|pp=335-337}} In January 1946, Adenauer initiated a political meeting of the future CDU in the British zone in his role as doyen (the oldest man in attendance, ''Alterspräsident'') and was informally confirmed as its leader</span>
				<span class='text'>Adenauer had become a leader almost by default</span>
				<span class='text'>During the Weimar Republic, Adenauer had often been considered a future Chancellor and after 1945, his claims for leadership were even stronger</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Schwarz Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>|1995|pp=345-346}} The other surviving ''Zentrum'' leaders were considered unsuitable for the tasks that lay ahead</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Schwarz Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>|1995|pp=344-346}}Reflecting his background as a Catholic Rhinelander who had long chafed under Prussian rule, Adenauer believed that Prussianism was the root cause of National Socialism, and that only by driving out Prussianism could Germany become a democracy</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Mitchell|2012|p=96}} In a December 1946 letter, Adenauer wrote that the Prussian state in the early 19th century had become an &quot;almost God-like entity&quot; that valued state power over the rights of individuals</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Mitchell|2012|p=96}} Adenauer's dislike of Prussia even led him to oppose [[Berlin]] as a future capital</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Mitchell|2012|p=97}} Adenauer's ''Sonderweg'' view of German history, with National Socialism as a natural outgrowth out of Prussianism, sharply contrasted with the views of the Social Democratic leader [[Kurt Schumacher]], who saw National Socialism as a natural outgrowth of capitalism</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Herf|1997|pp=218-219}} These two radically differing views of recent German history led Adenauer and Schumacher in turn to recommend very different solutions for a better future</span>
				<span class='text'>For Schumacher, to banish National Socialism meant replacing the capitalist system with a Marxist socialist system, whereas, for Adenauer, banishing National Socialism meant purging Prussianism</span>
				<span class='text'>Adenauer viewed the most important battle in the post-war world as between the forces of Christianity and [[Marxism]], especially Communism</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Mitchell|2012|p=132}} In Germany during this period, the term Marxism described both the Communists and the Social Democrats as the latter were officially a Marxist party until the [[Godesberg Program|Bad Godesberg conference]] of 1959 when the SPD repudiated its commitment to achieving a Marxist society</span>
				<span class='text'>The same anti-Marxist viewpoints led Adenauer to denounce the Social Democrats as the heirs to Prussianism and National Socialism</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Mitchell|2012|p=133}} Adenauer's ideology was at odds with many in the CDU, who wished to unite [[socialism]] and [[Christianity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Williams, p</span>
				<span class='text'>307&lt;/ref&gt; Adenauer worked diligently at building up contacts and support in the CDU over the following years, and he sought with varying success to impose his particular ideology on the party</span>
				<span class='text'>denauer's leading role in the CDU of the British zone won him a position at the [[Parliamentary Council of 1948]], called into existence by the Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to draft a constitution for the three western zones of Germany</span>
