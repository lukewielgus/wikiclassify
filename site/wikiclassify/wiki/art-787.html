				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Louis Kahn Memorial Park, Eleventh &amp; Pine Streets, [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]]]Louis Kahn's work infused the [[International Style (architecture)|International style]] with a fastidious, highly personal taste, a poetry of light</span>
				<span class='text'>His few projects reflect his deep personal involvement with each</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Isamu Noguchi]] called him &quot;a philosopher among architects</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He was known for his ability to create monumental architecture that responded to the human scale</span>
				<span class='text'>He also was concerned with creating strong formal distinctions between ''served'' spaces and ''servant'' spaces</span>
				<span class='text'>What he meant by ''servant'' spaces was not spaces for servants, but rather spaces that serve other spaces, such as stairwells, corridors, restrooms, or any other back-of-house function such as storage space or mechanical rooms</span>
				<span class='text'>His palette of materials tended toward heavily textured brick and bare concrete, the textures often reinforced by juxtaposition to highly refined surfaces such as travertine marble</span>
				<span class='text'>He is often well remembered for his deliberation about the use of brick, on how it can be more than the basic building material:&lt;blockquote&gt;If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, â€˜What do you want, Brick?â€™ And Brick says to you, â€˜I like an Arch</span>
				<span class='text'>€™ And if you say to Brick, â€˜Look, arches are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel over you</span>
				<span class='text'>What do you think of that, Brick?â€™ Brick says, â€˜I like an Arch</span>
				<span class='text'>€™ And itâ€™s important, you see, that you honor the material that you use</span>
				<span class='text'>[</span>
				<span class='text'>] You can only do it if you honor the brick and glorify the brick instead of shortchanging it</span>

				<span class='text'>The results often were technically innovative and highly refined</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition to the influence Kahn's more well-known work has on contemporary architects (such as [[Muzharul Islam]], [[Tadao Ando]]), some of his work (especially the unbuilt City Tower Project) became very influential among the [[high-tech architecture|high-tech]] architects of the late twentieth century (such as [[Renzo Piano]], who worked in Kahn's office, [[Richard Rogers]], and [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]])</span>
