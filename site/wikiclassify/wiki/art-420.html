				<span class='text'>However, because legend and obfuscation cloud his work even more than that of the other [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosophers]], one can give only a tentative account of his teachings, and some have questioned whether he contributed much to [[mathematics]] or [[natural philosophy]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to [[William Smith (lexicographer)|Sir William Smith]], with the exception of a few remarks by [[Xenophanes]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Herodotus]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Isocrates]], we are mainly dependent on [[Diogenes La√´rtius]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], and [[Iamblichus]] for biographical details</span>

				<span class='text'>The very assertion poses a difficulty: How can things which do not exist even be conceived to generate?

				<span class='text'>if|right |thumb|A visual proof of the Pythagorean theorem]]Since the fourth century AD, Pythagoras has commonly been given credit for discovering the [[Pythagorean theorem]], a theorem in geometry that states that in a right-angled triangle the area of the square on the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares of the other two sides‚Äîthat is, &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'>hile the theorem that now bears his name was known and previously utilized by the [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]] and [[Indian mathematics|Indians]], he, or his students, are often said to have constructed the first proof</span>
				<span class='text'>It must, however, be stressed that the way in which the Babylonians handled Pythagorean numbers implies that they knew that the principle was generally applicable, and knew some kind of proof, which has not yet been found in the (still largely unpublished) [[cuneiform]] sources</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;There are about 100,000 unpublished cuneiform sources in the [[British Museum]] alone</span>
				<span class='text'>Babylonian knowledge of proof of the Pythagorean Theorem is discussed by J</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Because of the secretive nature of his school and the custom of its students to attribute everything to their teacher, there is no evidence that Pythagoras himself worked on or proved this theorem</span>
				<span class='text'>For that matter, there is no evidence that he worked on any mathematical or meta-mathematical problems</span>
				<span class='text'>Some attribute it as a carefully constructed myth by followers of [[Plato]] over two centuries after the death of Pythagoras, mainly to bolster the case for Platonic meta-physics, which resonate well with the ideas they attributed to Pythagoras</span>
				<span class='text'>This attribution has stuck down the centuries up to modern times</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;From Christoph Riedweg , ''Pythagoras, His Life, Teaching and Influence'', Cornell: Cornell University Press, 2005: &quot;Had Pythagoras and his teachings not been since the early Academy overwritten with Plato's philosophy, and had this 'palimpsest' not in the course of the Roman Empire achieved unchallenged authority among Platonists, it would be scarcely conceivable that scholars from the Middle Ages and modernity down to the present would have found the Presocratic charismatic from Samos so fascinating</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, as a rule it was the image of Pythagoras elaborated by Neopythagoreans and Neoplatonists that determined the idea of what was Pythagorean over the centuries</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known mention of Pythagoras's name in connection with the theorem occurred five centuries after his death, in the writings of [[Cicero]] and [[Plutarch]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He went to the blacksmiths to learn how the sounds were produced by looking at their tools</span>
				<span class='text'> He discovered that it was because the [[Pythagorean hammers|hammers]] were &quot;simple ratios of each other, one was half the size of the first, another was 2/3 the size, and so on&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>his legend has since proven to be false by virtue of the fact that these ratios are only relevant to string length (such as the string of a [[monochord]]), and not to hammer weight</span>
