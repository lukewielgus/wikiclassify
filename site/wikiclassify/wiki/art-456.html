				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autobio&quot; /&gt;In the spring of 1877, Alice returned from India and removed the children from Lorne Lodge</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;autobio&quot; /&gt;In January 1878, Kipling was admitted to the [[United Services College]] at [[Westward Ho!]], Devon, a school founded a few years earlier to prepare boys for the [[British Army]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The school proved rough going for him at first, but later led to firm friendships, and provided the setting for his schoolboy stories ''[[Stalky &amp; Co</span>

				<span class='text'>e sailed for India on 20 September 1882 and arrived in Bombay on 18 October</span>
				<span class='text'>He described this moment years later: &quot;So, at sixteen years and nine months, but looking four or five years older, and adorned with real whiskers which the scandalised Mother abolished within one hour of beholding, I found myself at Bombay where I was born, moving among sights and smells that made me deliver in the vernacular sentences whose meaning I knew not</span>
				<span class='text'>Other Indian-born boys have told me how the same thing happened to them</span>

				<span class='text'>Stephen Wheeler, the editor, worked Kipling hard, but Kipling's need to write was unstoppable</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1886, he published his first collection of verse, ''Departmental Ditties</span>
				<span class='text'>' That year also brought a change of editors at the newspaper; Kay Robinson, the new editor, allowed more creative freedom and Kipling was asked to contribute short stories to the newspaper</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;plainsintro&quot; /&gt;In an article printed in the ''[[Chums (paper)|Chums]]'' boys' annual, an ex-colleague of Kipling's stated that </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;he never knew such a fellow for ink—he simply revelled in it, filling up his pen viciously, and then throwing the contents all over the office, so that it was almost dangerous to approach him&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>256, Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>V, 4 August 1897, page 798&lt;/ref&gt; The anecdote continues: &quot;In the hot weather, when he (Kipling) wore only white trousers and a thin vest, he is said to have resembled a [[Dalmatian dog]] more than a human being, for he was spotted all over with ink in every direction</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;During the summer of 1883, Kipling visited [[Shimla]] (then known as Simla), a well-known [[hill station]] and the summer capital of British India</span>
				<span class='text'>By then it was established practice for the [[Viceroy of India]] and the government to move to Simla for six months, and the town became a &quot;centre of power as well as pleasure&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;plainsintro&quot; /&gt; Kipling's family became yearly visitors to Simla, and Lockwood Kipling was asked to serve in Christ Church there</span>
				<span class='text'>Rudyard Kipling returned to Simla for his annual leave each year from 1885 to 1888, and the town featured prominently in many of the stories that he wrote for the ''Gazette''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;plainsintro&quot; /&gt;He describes this time: &quot;My month’s leave at Simla, or whatever Hill Station my people went to, was pure joy—every golden hour counted</span>
				<span class='text'>It began in heat and discomfort, by rail and road</span>
				<span class='text'>It ended in the cool evening, with a wood fire in one’s bedroom, and next morn—thirty more of them ahead!—the early cup of tea, the Mother who brought it in, and the long talks of us all together again</span>
				<span class='text'>One had leisure to work, too, at whatever play-work was in one’s head, and that was usually full</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autobio&quot; /&gt;Back in Lahore, some thirty-nine stories appeared in the ''Gazette'' between November 1886 and June 1887</span>
				<span class='text'>Kipling included most of these stories in ''[[Plain Tales from the Hills]]'', his first prose collection, which was published in [[Calcutta]] in January 1888, a month after his 22nd birthday</span>
				<span class='text'>Kipling's time in Lahore, however, had come to an end</span>
				<span class='text'>In November 1887, he was transferred to the ''Gazette'''s much larger sister newspaper, ''The Pioneer'', in [[Allahabad]] in the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In Allahabad, he worked as the Assistant editor of The Pioneer, and lived in Belvedere house, Allahabad from 1888-89</span>

				<span class='text'>]Kipling's writing continued at a frenetic pace; in 1888, he published six collections of short stories: ''Soldiers Three'', ''The Story of the Gadsbys'', ''In Black and White'', ''[[Under the Deodars]]'', ''[[The Phantom 'Rickshaw and other Eerie Tales|The Phantom Rickshaw]]'', and ''[[Wee Willie Winkie and Other Child Stories|Wee Willie Winkie]]'', containing a total of 41 stories, some quite long</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, as ''The Pioneer's'' special correspondent in the western region of [[Rajputana Agency|Rajputana]], he wrote many sketches that were later collected in ''Letters of Marque'' and published in ''[[From Sea to Sea and Other Sketches, Letters of Travel]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;plainsintro&quot; /&gt;Kipling was discharged from ''The Pioneer'' in early 1889, after a dispute</span>
				<span class='text'>By this time, he had been increasingly thinking about the future</span>
				<span class='text'>He sold the rights to his six volumes of stories for £200 and a small royalty, and the ''Plain Tales'' for £50; in addition, from ''The Pioneer'', he received six-months' salary ''in lieu'' of notice</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;autobio&quot; /&gt;=== Return to London ===He decided to use this money to make his way to London, the literary centre of the [[British Empire]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On 9 March 1889, Kipling left India, travelling first to [[San Francisco]] via [[Yangon|Rangoon]], Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan</span>
				<span class='text'>Kipling was favourably impressed by Japan, writing that the Japanese were &quot;gracious folk and fair manners&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Kipling later wrote that he &quot;had lost his heart&quot; to a geisha whom he called O-Toyo, writing while in the United States during the same trip across the Pacific that: &quot;I had left the innocent East far behind</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>eeping softly for O-Toyo</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>-Toyo was a darling&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt;  Kipling then traveled through the United States, writing articles for ''The Pioneer'' that were later published in ''[[From Sea to Sea and Other Sketches, Letters of Travel]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>to [[Yellowstone National Park]]; down to [[Salt Lake City]]; then east to [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and on to [[Chicago]], Illinois; then to [[Beaver, Pennsylvania]] on the [[Ohio River]] to visit the Hill family; from there, he went to [[Chautauqua]] with Professor Hill, and later to [[Niagara Falls]], [[Toronto]], Washington, D</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;pinney1&quot; /&gt;In the course of this journey, he met [[Mark Twain]] in [[Elmira, New York]], and was deeply impressed</span>
				<span class='text'>Kipling arrived unannounced at Twain's home, and later wrote as he rung the doorbell that: &quot;It occurred to me for the first time that Mark Twain might possibly have other engagements other than the entertainment of escaped lunatics from India, be they ever so full of admiration</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As it was, Twain was glad to welcome Kipling and had a two-hour conversation with him on trends in Anglo-American literature and about whatever Twain was going to write a sequel to ''Tom Sawyer'' with Twain assuring Kipling that a sequel was coming, but he had not decided upon the ending; either Sawyer would be elected to Congress or would be hanged</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;/&gt; Twain who rather liked Kipling later wrote about their meeting: &quot;Between us, we cover all knowledge; he covers all that can be known and I cover the rest&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;gilmour&quot; /&gt; When they arrived in [[Yokohama]], Japan, they discovered that their bank, [[Oriental Bank Corporation|The New Oriental Banking Corporation]], had failed</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;autobio&quot; /&gt;According to Kipling, &quot;We furnished it with a simplicity that fore-ran the [[hire-purchase]] system</span>
				<span class='text'>We bought, second or third hand, a huge, hot-air stove which we installed in the cellar</span>
				<span class='text'>We cut generous holes in our thin floors for its eight-inch [20 cm] tin pipes (why we were not burned in our beds each week of the winter I never can understand) and we were extraordinarily and self-centredly content</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autobio&quot; /&gt;In this house, which they called ''Bliss Cottage'', their first child, Josephine, was born &quot;in three foot of snow on the night of 29 December 1892</span>

				<span class='text'>After blocking out the main idea in my head, the pen took charge, and I watched it begin to write stories about [[Mowgli]] and animals, which later grew into the two ''Jungle Books ''&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>However, it is true that Kipling was emotionally devastated by the death of his son</span>
				<span class='text'>Kipling was said to help assuage his grief over the death of his son through reading the novels of [[Jane Austen]] aloud to his wife and daughter</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;'The Many Lovers of Miss Jane Austen', broadcast BBC2 9pm 23 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, he wrote a booklet ''[[The Fringes of the Fleet]]''&lt;ref&gt;''The Fringes of the Fleet'', Macmillan &amp; Co</span>

				<span class='text'>Some of the poems were set to music by English composer [[Edward Elgar]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Hammoneau presented Kipling with the book (with bullet still embedded) and his Croix de Guerre as a token of gratitude</span>
				<span class='text'>They continued to correspond, and when Hammoneau had a son, Kipling insisted on returning the book and medal</span>

				<span class='text'>With the increasing popularity of the automobile, Kipling became a motoring correspondent for the British press, and wrote enthusiastically of his trips around England and abroad, even though he was usually driven by a chauffeur</span>
				<span class='text'>fter the war, Kipling was skeptical about the [[Fourteen Points]] and the [[League of Nations]], but he had great hopes that the United States would abandon isolationism and that the post-war world would be dominated by an Anglo-French-American alliance</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gilmour, David pages 300&quot; /&gt; An admirer of [[Raymond Poincaré]], Kipling was one of the few British intellectuals who supported the French [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] in 1923 at a time when the British government and most public opinion was against the French position</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the popular British view of Poincaré as a cruel bully intent on impoverishing Germany by seeking unreasonable reparations, Kipling argued that Poincaré was only rightfully trying to preserve France as a great power in the face of an unfavourable situation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gilmour, David pages 300-301&quot; /&gt; Kipling argued that even before 1914 Germany's larger economy and birthrate had made that country stronger than France, that with much of France devastated by the war and the French suffering heavy losses that the low French birthrate would have trouble replacing while Germany was mostly undamaged and with a higher birth rate, that it was madness for Britain to seek to pressure France to revise Versailles in Germany's favour</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gilmour, David pages 300-301&quot; /&gt; In 1924, Kipling was opposed to the Labour government of [[Ramsay MacDonald]] as &quot;Bolshevism without bullets&quot;, but believing that Labour was a Communist front organisation he took the view that &quot;excited orders and instructions from Moscow&quot; would expose Labour as such an organisation to the British people</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Kipling's views were on the right and though he admired [[Benito Mussolini]] to a certain extent for a time in the 1920s, Kipling was against [[fascism]], writing that [[Oswald Mosley]] was &quot;a bounder and an ''arriviste''&quot;; by 1935 he called Mussolini a deranged and dangerous egomaniac and in 1933 wrote &quot;The Hitlerites are out for blood&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Despite his anti-communism, the first major translations of Kipling into Russian took place in the early 1920s, and during the interwar period Kipling was very popular with the Russian readers and many of the younger Russian poets and writers such as [[Konstantin Simonov]] were influenced by Kipling</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; It was obligatory for Soviet journals that featured translations of Kipling to begin with an introduction attacking him as a &quot;fascist&quot; and an &quot;imperialist&quot;, but such was Kipling's popularity with Russian readers that his works was not banned in the Soviet Union until 1939 with the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;auto7&quot;/&gt; Kipling's work was unbanned in the Soviet Union in 1941 after Operation Barbarossa and when Britain become a Soviet ally , but his work was banned again, this time for good with the Cold War in 1946</span>

				<span class='text'>Kipling's stories for adults remain in print and have garnered high praise from writers as different as [[Poul Anderson]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], and [[Randall Jarrell]] who wrote that, &quot;After you have read Kipling's fifty or seventy-five best stories you realize that few men have written this many stories of this much merit, and that very few have written more and better stories</span>

				<span class='text'>The [[Jungle Book (1942 film)|first]] was made by producer [[Alexander Korda]], and other films have been produced by the [[Walt Disney Company]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A number of his poems were set to music by [[Percy Grainger]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A series of short films based on some of his stories was broadcast by the BBC in 1964</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|298668|The Indian Tales of Rudyard Kipling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kipling's work is still popular today</span>

				<span class='text'>Eliot's essay occupies 31 pages</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Eliot was aware of the complaints that had been levelled against Kipling and he dismissed them one by one: that Kipling is 'a Tory' using his verse to transmit right wing political views, or 'a journalist' pandering to popular taste; while Eliot writes &quot;I cannot find any justification for the charge that he held a doctrine of race superiority</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>a very few whom I should call great verse writers</span>
				<span class='text'>And unless I am mistaken, Kipling's position in this class is not only high, but unique</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In response to Eliot, [[George Orwell]] wrote a long consideration of Kipling's work for ''[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]'' in 1942, noting that although as a &quot;jingo imperialist&quot; Kipling was &quot;morally insensitive and aesthetically disgusting&quot;, his work had many qualities which ensured that while &quot;every enlightened person has despised him </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>nine-tenths of those enlightened persons are forgotten and Kipling is in some sense still there&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Orwell summarized that{{quote|One reason for Kipling's power [was] his sense of responsibility, which made it possible for him to have a world-view, even though it happened to be a false one</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he had no direct connexion with any political party, Kipling was a Conservative, a thing that does not exist nowadays</span>
				<span class='text'>Those who now call themselves Conservatives are either Liberals, Fascists or the accomplices of Fascists</span>
				<span class='text'>He identified himself with the ruling power and not with the opposition</span>
				<span class='text'>In a gifted writer this seems to us strange and even disgusting, but it did have the advantage of giving Kipling a certain grip on reality</span>
				<span class='text'>The ruling power is always faced with the question, 'In such and such circumstances, what would you ''do?''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;, whereas the opposition is not obliged to take responsibility or make any real decisions</span>
				<span class='text'>Where it is a permanent and pensioned opposition, as in England, the quality of its thought deteriorates accordingly</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, anyone who starts out with a pessimistic, reactionary view of life tends to be justified by events, for Utopia never arrives and 'the gods of the copybook headings', as Kipling himself put it, always return</span>
				<span class='text'>Kipling sold out to the British governing class, not financially but emotionally</span>
				<span class='text'>This warped his political judgement, for the British ruling class were not what he imagined, and it led him into abysses of folly and snobbery, but he gained a corresponding advantage from having at least tried to imagine what action and responsibility are like</span>
				<span class='text'>It is a great thing in his favour that he is not witty, not 'daring', has no wish to ''[[Épater la bourgeoisie|épater les bourgeois]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He dealt largely in platitudes, and since we live in a world of platitudes, much of what he said sticks</span>
				<span class='text'>Even his worst follies seem less shallow and less irritating than the 'enlightened' utterances of the same period, such as Wilde's epigrams or the collection of cracker-mottoes at the end of ''[[Man and Superman]]''</span>
