				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, the film was finished on time and released to theaters on July 3, 1991</span>
				<span class='text'>'Terminator 2'', or ''T2'', as it was abbreviated, broke box-office records (including the opening weekend record for an [[R-rated]] film), earning over $200&amp;nbsp;million in the United States and Canada, and over $300&amp;nbsp;million in other territories, and became the highest-grossing film of that year</span>
