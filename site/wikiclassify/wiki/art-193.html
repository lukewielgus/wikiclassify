				<span class='text'>His father, Urbano Fellini (1894‚Äì1956), born to a family of [[Romagna|Romagnol]] peasants and small landholders from [[Gambettola]], moved to [[Rome]] in 1915 as a baker [[apprentice]]d to the Pantanella pasta factory</span>
				<span class='text'>His mother, Ida Barbiani (1896‚Äì1984), came from a bourgeois [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] family of Roman merchants</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite her family's vehement disapproval, she had eloped with Urbano in 1917 to live at his parents' home in Gambettola</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alpert, 16&lt;/ref&gt; A civil marriage followed in 1918 with the religious ceremony held at [[Santa Maria Maggiore]] in Rome a year later</span>
				<span class='text'>he couple settled in Rimini where Urbano became a [[Vendor (supply chain) |traveling salesman]] and [[wholesale]] [[vendor]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Fellini had two siblings: Riccardo (1921‚Äì1991), a documentary director for [[RAI]] Television, and Maria Maddalena (m</span>
				<span class='text'>Fabbri; 1929‚Äì2002)</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1924, Fellini started primary school in an institute run by the nuns of San Vincenzo in Rimini, attending the Carlo Tonni public school two years later</span>
				<span class='text'>An attentive student, he spent his leisure time drawing, staging puppet shows, and reading ''Il corriere dei piccoli'', the popular children‚Äôs magazine that reproduced traditional American cartoons by [[Winsor McCay]], [[George McManus]] and [[Frederick Burr Opper]]</span>
				<span class='text'>(Opper‚Äôs [[Happy Hooligan]] would provide the visual inspiration for Gelsomina in Fellini's 1954 film ''[[La Strada]]''; McCay‚Äôs ''[[Little Nemo]]'' would directly influence his 1980 film ''[[City of Women]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;ref name= &quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Bondanella, ''The Films of Federico Fellini'', 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, he discovered the world of [[Grand Guignol]], the circus with [[Pierino]] the Clown, and the movies</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Guido Brignone]]‚Äôs ''Maciste all‚ÄôInferno'' (1926), the first film he saw, would mark him in ways linked to [[Dante]] and the cinema throughout his entire career</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Burke and Waller, 5&amp;ndash;13&lt;/ref&gt;Enrolled at the Ginnasio Giulio Cesare in 1929, he made friends with Luigi ‚ÄòTitta‚Äô Benzi, later a prominent Rimini lawyer (and the model for young Titta in ''[[Amarcord]]'' (1973))</span>
				<span class='text'>In [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]‚Äôs Italy, Fellini and Riccardo became members of the ''Avanguardista'', the compulsory [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] youth group for males</span>
				<span class='text'>He visited Rome with his parents for the first time in 1933, the year of the maiden voyage of the transatlantic ocean liner ''[[SS Rex]]'' (which is shown in ''Amarcord'')</span>
				<span class='text'>The sea creature found on the beach at the end of ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' (1960) has its basis in a giant fish marooned on a Rimini beach during a storm in 1934</span>
				<span class='text'>lthough Fellini adapted key events from his childhood and adolescence in films such as ''[[I Vitelloni]]'' (1953), ''[[8¬Ω]]'' (1963), and ''[[Amarcord]]'' (1973), he insisted that such autobiographical memories were inventions: {{Quote |It is not memory that dominates my films</span>
				<span class='text'>To say that my films are autobiographical is an overly facile liquidation, a hasty classification</span>
				<span class='text'>It seems to me that I have invented almost everything: childhood, character, nostalgias, dreams, memories, for the pleasure of being able to recount them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Fellini interview in ''Panorama'' 18 (14 January 1980)</span>
				<span class='text'>Screenwriters [[Tullio Pinelli]] and [[Bernardino Zapponi]], cinematographer [[Giuseppe Rotunno]] and set designer [[Dante Ferretti]] also reported that Fellini imagined many of his ‚Äúmemories‚Äù</span>
				<span class='text'>Cf</span>
				<span class='text'>Bernardino Zapponi's memoir, ''Il mio Fellini'' and Fellini's own insistence on having created his cinematic autobiography in ''I'm a Born Liar: A Fellini Lexicon'', 32&lt;/ref&gt;}}In 1937, Fellini opened Febo, a portrait shop in Rimini</span>
				<span class='text'>with the painter Demos Bonini</span>
				<span class='text'>His first humorous article appeared in the &quot;Postcards to Our Readers&quot; section of Milan‚Äôs ''Domenica del Corriere''</span>
				<span class='text'>Deciding on a career as a caricaturist and gag writer, Fellini travelled to [[Florence]] in 1938, where he published his first cartoon in the weekly ''420''</span>
				<span class='text'>Failing his military culture exam, he graduated from high school in July 1938 after doubling the exam</span>
				<span class='text'>==Rome (1939)===In September 1939, he enrolled in law school at the [[Sapienza University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]] to please his parents</span>
				<span class='text'>Biographer [[Hollis Alpert]] reports that &quot;there is no record of his ever having attended a class&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alpert, 33&lt;/ref&gt; Installed in a family pensione, he met another lifelong friend, the painter Rinaldo Geleng</span>
				<span class='text'>Desperately poor, they unsuccessfully joined forces to draw sketches of restaurant and caf√© patrons</span>
				<span class='text'>Fellini eventually found work as a cub reporter on the dailies ''Il Piccolo'' and ''Il Popolo di Roma'' but quit after a short stint, bored by the local court news assignments</span>
				<span class='text'>our months after publishing his first article in ''Marc‚ÄôAurelio'', the highly influential biweekly humour magazine, he joined the editorial board, achieving success with a regular column titled ''But Are You Listening?''&lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 31&lt;/ref&gt; Described as ‚Äúthe determining moment in Fellini‚Äôs life‚Äù,&lt;ref&gt;Bondanella, ''The Films of Federico Fellini'', 8&lt;/ref&gt; the magazine gave him steady employment between 1939 and 1942, when he interacted with writers, gagmen, and scriptwriters</span>
				<span class='text'>These encounters eventually led to opportunities in show business and cinema</span>
				<span class='text'>Among his collaborators on the magazine‚Äôs editorial board were the future director [[Ettore Scola]], [[Marxist]] theorist and scriptwriter [[Cesare Zavattini]], and [[Bernardino Zapponi]], a future Fellini screenwriter</span>
				<span class='text'>Conducting interviews for ''CineMagazzino'' also proved congenial: when asked to interview [[Aldo Fabrizi]], Italy‚Äôs most popular variety performer, he established such immediate personal rapport with the man that they collaborated professionally</span>
				<span class='text'>Specializing in humorous monologues, Fabrizi commissioned material from his young prot√©g√©</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 55&lt;/ref&gt;==Career and later life===== Early screenplays (1940‚Äì1943) ===[[File:Federico Fellini</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Federico Fellini during the 1950s]]Retained on business in Rimini, Urbano sent wife and family to Rome in 1940 to share an apartment with his son</span>
				<span class='text'>Fellini and Ruggero Maccari, also on the staff of ''Marc‚ÄôAurelio'', began writing radio sketches and gags for films</span>
				<span class='text'>ot yet twenty and with Fabrizi‚Äôs help, Fellini obtained his first screen credit as a comedy writer on [[Mario Mattoli]]‚Äôs ''[[Il pirata sono io]]'' (''The Pirate's Dream'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Progressing rapidly to numerous collaborations on films at [[Cinecitt√†]], his circle of professional acquaintances widened to include novelist [[Vitaliano Brancati]] and scriptwriter Piero Tellini</span>
				<span class='text'>In the wake of Mussolini‚Äôs declaration of war against France and England on June 10, 1940, Fellini discovered [[Kafka]]‚Äôs ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'', [[Gogol]], [[John Steinbeck]] and [[William Faulkner]] along with French films by [[Marcel Carn√©]], [[Ren√© Clair]], and [[Julien Duvivier]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alpert, 42&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941 he published ''Il mio amico Pasqualino'', a 74-page booklet in ten chapters describing the absurd adventures of Pasqualino, an alter ego</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 35&lt;/ref&gt;Writing for radio while attempting to avoid the draft, Fellini met his future wife [[Giulietta Masina]] in a studio office at the Italian public radio broadcaster [[Ente Italiano per le Audizioni Radiofoniche|EIAR]] in the autumn of 1942</span>
				<span class='text'>Well-paid as the voice of Pallina in Fellini's radio serial, ''Cico and Pallina'', Masina was also well known for her musical-comedy broadcasts which cheered an audience depressed by the war</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;&quot;Giulietta is practical, and likes the fact that she earns a handsome fee for her radio work, whereas theater never pays well</span>
				<span class='text'>And of course the fame counts for something too</span>
				<span class='text'>Radio is a booming business and comedy reviews have a broad and devoted public</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Kezich, 48&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1942, Fellini was sent to [[Libya]], occupied by Fascist Italy, to work on the screenplay of ''I cavalieri del deserto'' (''[[Knights of the Desert (film)|Knights of the Desert]]'', 1942), directed by [[Osvaldo Valenti]] and Gino Talamo</span>
				<span class='text'>Fellini welcomed the assignment as it allowed him &quot;to secure another extension on his draft order&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 70&lt;/ref&gt; Responsible for emergency re-writing, he also directed the film's first scenes</span>
				<span class='text'>When [[Tripoli]] fell under siege by British forces, he and his colleagues made a narrow escape by boarding a German military plane flying to [[Sicily]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His African adventure, later published in ''Marc‚ÄôAurelio'' as &quot;The First Flight&quot;, marked ‚Äúthe emergence of a new Fellini, no longer just a screenwriter, working and sketching at his desk, but a filmmaker out in the field‚Äù</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 71&lt;/ref&gt;The [[apolitical]] Fellini was finally freed of the draft when an Allied air raid over [[Bologna]] destroyed his medical records</span>
				<span class='text'>Fellini and Giulietta hid in her aunt‚Äôs apartment until Mussolini's fall on July 25, 1943</span>
				<span class='text'>After dating for nine months, the couple were married on October 30, 1943</span>
				<span class='text'>Several months later, Masina fell down the stairs and suffered a miscarriage</span>
				<span class='text'>She gave birth to a son, Pierfederico, on 22 March 1945, but the child died of [[encephalitis]] a month later on 24 April 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 74&lt;/ref&gt; The tragedy had enduring emotional and artistic repercussions</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Neorealist apprenticeship (1944‚Äì1949)===After the Allied liberation of Rome on June 4, 1944, Fellini and Enrico De Seta opened the Funny Face Shop where they survived the postwar recession drawing caricatures of American soldiers</span>
				<span class='text'>He became involved with [[Italian Neorealism]] when [[Roberto Rossellini]], at work on ''Stories of Yesteryear'' (later ''[[Rome, Open City]]''), met Fellini in his shop proposing he contribute gags and dialogue for the script </span>
				<span class='text'>Aware of Fellini‚Äôs reputation as Aldo Fabrizi‚Äôs ‚Äúcreative muse‚Äù,&lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 78&lt;/ref&gt; Rossellini also requested he try to convince the actor to play the role of Father Giuseppe Morosini, the parish priest executed by the [[SS]] on April 4, 1944</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1947, Fellini and [[Sergio Amidei]] received an Oscar nomination for the screenplay of ''Rome, Open City''</span>
				<span class='text'>orking as both screenwriter and assistant director on Rossellini‚Äôs ''[[Pais√†]]'' (''Paisan'') in 1946, Fellini was entrusted to film the Sicilian scenes in [[Maiori]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In February 1948, he was introduced to [[Marcello Mastroianni]], then a young theatre actor appearing in a play with Giulietta Masina</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 404&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing a close working relationship with [[Alberto Lattuada]], Fellini co-wrote the director‚Äôs ''[[Senza piet√†]]'' (''Without Pity'') and ''[[Il mulino del Po]]'' (''The Mill on the Po'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Fellini also worked with Rossellini on the [[anthology film]] ''[[L'Amore (film)|L'Amore]]'' (1948), co-writing the screenplay and in one segment titled, &quot;The Miracle&quot;, acting opposite [[Anna Magnani]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To play the role of a vagabond rogue mistaken by Magnani for a saint, Fellini had to bleach his black hair blond</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|250px|right|thumb|Fellini, Masina, Carla del Poggio and Alberto Lattuada, 1952]]In 1950 Fellini co-produced and co-directed with Alberto Lattuada ''[[Variety Lights]]'' (''Luci del variet√†''), his first feature film</span>
				<span class='text'>A backstage comedy set among the world of small-time travelling performers, it featured Giulietta Masina and Lattuada‚Äôs wife, [[Carla Del Poggio|Carla del Poggio]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Its release to poor reviews and limited distribution proved disastrous for all concerned</span>
				<span class='text'>The production company went bankrupt, leaving both Fellini and Lattuada with debts to pay for over a decade</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 114&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1950, ''Pais√†'' received an Oscar nomination for the screenplay by Rossellini, [[Sergio Amidei]], and Fellini</span>
				<span class='text'>fter travelling to Paris for a script conference with Rossellini on ''[[Europa '51]]'', Fellini began production on ''[[The White Sheik]]'' in September 1951, his first solo-directed feature</span>
				<span class='text'>Starring [[Alberto Sordi]] in the title role, the film is a revised version of a treatment first written by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] in 1949 and based on the ''fotoromanzi'', the photographed cartoon strip romances popular in Italy at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>Producer [[Carlo Ponti]] commissioned Fellini and [[Tullio Pinelli]] to write the script but Antonioni rejected the story they developed</span>
				<span class='text'>With [[Ennio Flaiano]], they re-worked the material into a light-hearted satire about newlywed couple Ivan and Wanda Cavalli ([[Leopoldo Trieste]], Brunella Bovo) in Rome to visit the Pope</span>
				<span class='text'>Ivan‚Äôs prissy mask of respectability is soon demolished by his wife‚Äôs obsession with the White Sheik</span>
				<span class='text'>Highlighting the music of [[Nino Rota]], the film was selected at Cannes (among the films in competition was [[Orson Welles]]‚Äôs ''[[Othello (1952 film)|Othello]]'') and then retracted</span>
				<span class='text'>Screened at the [[13th Venice International Film Festival]], it was razzed by critics in &quot;the atmosphere of a soccer match‚Äù</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 128&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer declared that Fellini had ‚Äúnot the slightest aptitude for cinema direction&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1953, ''[[I Vitelloni]]'' found favour with the critics and public</span>
				<span class='text'>Winning the Silver Lion Award in Venice, it secured Fellini‚Äôs first international distributor</span>
				<span class='text'>==Beyond neorealism (1954‚Äì1960)===Fellini directed ''[[La Strada]]'' based on a script completed in 1952 with Pinelli and Flaiano</span>
				<span class='text'>During the last three weeks of shooting, Fellini experienced the first signs of severe clinical depression</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kezich, 158&quot;&gt;Kezich, 158&lt;/ref&gt; Aided by his wife, he undertook a brief period of therapy with Freudian psychoanalyst Emilio Servadio</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Kezich, 158&quot;/&gt;Fellini cast American actor [[Broderick Crawford]] to interpret the role of an aging swindler in ''[[Il Bidone]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Based partly on stories told to him by a petty thief during production of ''La Strada'', Fellini developed the script into a con man‚Äôs slow descent towards a solitary death</span>
				<span class='text'>To incarnate the role‚Äôs &quot;intense, tragic face&quot;, Fellini‚Äôs first choice had been [[Humphrey Bogart]]&lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 167&lt;/ref&gt; but after learning of the actor‚Äôs lung cancer, chose Crawford after seeing his face on the theatrical poster of ''[[All the King's Men (1949 film)|All the King‚Äôs Men]]'' (1949)</span>
				<span class='text'>The film shoot was wrought with difficulties stemming from Crawford‚Äôs alcoholism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 168-69&lt;/ref&gt; Savaged by critics at the [[16th Venice International Film Festival]], the film did miserable box office and did not receive international distribution until 1964</span>

				<span class='text'>Located in a mental institution for women, financial backers considered the subject had no potential and the project was abandoned</span>
				<span class='text'>hile preparing ''[[Nights of Cabiria]]'' in spring 1956, Fellini learned of his father‚Äôs death by cardiac arrest at the age of sixty-two</span>
				<span class='text'>Produced by [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and starring Giulietta Masina, the film took its inspiration from  news reports of a woman‚Äôs severed head retrieved in a lake and stories by Wanda, a shantytown prostitute Fellini met on the set of ''[[Il Bidone]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 177&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] was hired to translate Flaiano and Pinelli‚Äôs dialogue into Roman dialect and to supervise researches in the vice-afflicted suburbs of Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>The movie won the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[30th Academy Awards]] and brought Masina the Best Actress Award at Cannes for her performance</span>
				<span class='text'>ith Pinelli, he developed ''Journey with Anita'' for [[Sophia Loren]] and [[Gregory Peck]]</span>
				<span class='text'>An &quot;invention born out of intimate truth&quot;, the script was based on Fellini's return to Rimini with a mistress to attend his father's funeral</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 189&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Loren‚Äôs unavailability, the project was shelved and resurrected twenty-five years later as ''[[Lovers and Liars]]'' (1981), a comedy directed by [[Mario Monicelli]] with [[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Giancarlo Giannini]]</span>
				<span class='text'>For [[Eduardo De Filippo]], he co-wrote the script of ''[[Fortunella (film)|Fortunella]]'', tailoring the lead role to accommodate Masina‚Äôs particular sensibility</span>
				<span class='text'>he [[Hollywood on the Tiber]] phenomenon of 1958 in which American studios profited from the cheap studio labour available in Rome provided the backdrop for photojournalists to steal shots of celebrities on the via Veneto</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alpert, 122&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal provoked by Turkish dancer Haish Nana‚Äôs improvised striptease at a nightclub captured Fellini‚Äôs imagination: he decided to end his latest script-in-progress, ''Moraldo in the City'', with an all-night &quot;orgy&quot; at a seaside villa</span>
				<span class='text'>Pierluigi Praturlon‚Äôs photos of [[Anita Ekberg]] wading fully dressed in the [[Trevi Fountain]] provided further inspiration for Fellini and his scriptwriters</span>
				<span class='text'>Changing the title of the screenplay to ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', Fellini soon clashed with his producer on casting: the director insisted on the relatively unknown Mastroianni while De Laurentiis wanted [[Paul Newman]] as a hedge on his investment</span>
				<span class='text'>Reaching an impasse, De Laurentiis sold the rights to publishing mogul [[Angelo Rizzoli]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Shooting began on March 16, 1959 with Anita Ekberg climbing the stairs to the cupola of Saint Peter‚Äôs in a mammoth d√©cor constructed at [[Cinecitt√†]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The statue of Christ flown by helicopter over Rome to [[Saint Peter's Square]] was inspired by an actual media event on May 1, 1956, which Fellini had witnessed</span>
				<span class='text'>The film wrapped August 15 on a deserted beach at [[Passo Oscuro]] with a bloated mutant fish designed by [[Piero Gherardi]]</span>
				<span class='text'>'[[La Dolce Vita]]'' broke all box office records</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite scalpers selling tickets at 1000 lire,&lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 208&lt;/ref&gt; crowds queued in line for hours to see an ‚Äúimmoral movie‚Äù before the censors banned it</span>
				<span class='text'>At an exclusive [[Milan]] screening on February 5, 1960, one outraged patron spat on Fellini while others hurled insults</span>
				<span class='text'>Denounced in parliament by right-wing conservatives, undersecretary Domenico Magr√¨ of the Christian Democrats demanded tolerance for the film‚Äôs controversial themes</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 209&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s official press organ, ''[[l'Osservatore Romano]]'', lobbied for censorship while the Board of Roman Parish Priests and the Genealogical Board of Italian Nobility attacked the film</span>
				<span class='text'>In one documented instance involving favourable reviews written by the Jesuits of San Fedele, defending ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' had severe consequences</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 210&lt;/ref&gt; In competition at Cannes alongside Antonioni‚Äôs ''[[L‚ÄôAvventura]]'', the film won the [[Cannes Film Festival|Palme d'Or]] awarded by presiding juror [[Georges Simenon]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|150px|left|thumb|Federico Fellini]]A major discovery for Fellini after his [[Italian neorealism]] period (1950‚Äì1959) was the work of [[Carl Jung]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Despite the best intentions, their overcautious editorial and business skills forced the company to close down soon after cancelling Pasolini‚Äôs project, ''[[Accattone]]'' (1961)</span>

				<span class='text'>Infused with the [[surrealistic]] satire that characterized the young Fellini‚Äôs work at ''Marc‚ÄôAurelio'', the film ridiculed a crusader against vice, interpreted by [[Peppino De Filippo]], who goes insane trying to censor a billboard of [[Anita Ekberg]] espousing the virtues of milk</span>
				<span class='text'>n an October 1960 letter to his colleague Brunello Rondi, Fellini first outlined his film ideas about a man suffering creative block: &quot;Well then - a guy (a writer? any kind of professional man? a theatrical producer?) has to interrupt the usual rhythm of his life for two weeks because of a not-too-serious disease</span>
				<span class='text'>It‚Äôs a warning bell: something is blocking up his system</span>

				<span class='text'>Flaiano suggested ''La bella confusione'' (literally ''The Beautiful Confusion'') as the movie‚Äôs title</span>
				<span class='text'>Under pressure from his producers, Fellini finally settled on ''8¬Ω'', a [[self-referential]] title referring principally (but not exclusively)&lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 234 and Affron, 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; to the number of films he had directed up to that time</span>
				<span class='text'>iving the order to start production in spring 1962, Fellini signed deals with his producer Rizzoli, fixed dates, had sets constructed, cast Mastroianni, [[Anouk Aim√©e]], and [[Sandra Milo]] in lead roles, and did screen tests at the Scalera Studios in Rome</span>
				<span class='text'>He hired [[cinematographer]] [[Gianni Di Venanzo]], among key personnel</span>
				<span class='text'>But apart from naming his hero Guido Anselmi, he still couldn't decide what his character did for a living</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alpert, 160&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis came to a head in April when, sitting in his Cinecitt√† office, he began a letter to Rizzoli confessing he had &quot;lost his film&quot; and had to abandon the project</span>
				<span class='text'>Interrupted by the chief machinist requesting he celebrate the launch of ''8¬Ω'', Fellini put aside the letter and went on the set</span>
				<span class='text'>Raising a toast to the crew, he &quot;felt overwhelmed by shame‚Ä¶ I was in a no exit situation</span>
				<span class='text'>I was a director who wanted to make a film he no longer remembers</span>
				<span class='text'>And lo and behold, at that very moment everything fell into place</span>
				<span class='text'>I got straight to the heart of the film</span>
				<span class='text'>I would narrate everything that had been happening to me</span>

				<span class='text'>Perplexed by the seemingly chaotic, incessant improvisation on the set, Deena Boyer, the director‚Äôs American press officer at the time, asked for a rationale</span>
				<span class='text'>Fellini told her that he hoped to convey the three levels &quot;on which our minds live: the past, the present, and the conditional - the realm of fantasy&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alpert, 170&lt;/ref&gt;  After shooting wrapped on October 14, [[Nino Rota]] composed various circus marches and fanfares that would later become signature tunes of the maestro‚Äôs cinema</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 245&lt;/ref&gt; Nominated for four Oscars, ''8¬Ω'' won awards for best foreign language film and best costume design in black-and-white</span>

				<span class='text'>ncreasingly attracted to [[parapsychology]], Fellini met the [[Turin]] magician [[Gustavo Rol]] in 1963</span>
				<span class='text'>Rol, a former banker, introduced him to the world of [[Spiritism]] and [[s√©ances]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1964, Fellini took [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]&lt;ref&gt;A synthetic derivative &quot;fashioned to produce the same effects as the hallucinogenic mushrooms used by Mexican tribes&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 255&lt;/ref&gt; For years reserved about what actually occurred that Sunday afternoon, he admitted in 1992 that&lt;blockquote&gt;objects and their functions no longer had any significance</span>
				<span class='text'>All I perceived was perception itself, the hell of forms and figures devoid of human emotion and detached from the reality of my unreal environment</span>
				<span class='text'>I was an instrument in a virtual world that constantly renewed its own meaningless image in a living world that was itself perceived outside of nature</span>
				<span class='text'>And since the appearance of things was no longer definitive but limitless, this paradisiacal awareness freed me from the reality external to my self</span>
				<span class='text'>The fire and the rose, as it were, became one</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Fellini and Pettigrew, 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Fellini's hallucinatory insights were given full flower in his first colour feature ''[[Juliet of the Spirits]]'' (1965), depicting [[Giulietta Masina]] as Juliet, a housewife who rightly suspects her husband's infidelity and succumbs to the voices of spirits summoned during a s√©ance at her home</span>
				<span class='text'>  Her sexually voracious next door neighbor Suzy ([[Sandra Milo]]) introduces Juliet to a world of uninhibited sensuality but Juliet is haunted by childhood memories of her [[Catholic guilt]] and a teenaged friend who committed suicide</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Kezich, 410&lt;/ref&gt; In February, Fellini scouted locations in Paris for ''[[The Clowns (film)|The Clowns]]'', a [[docufiction]] both for cinema and television, based on his childhood memories of the circus and a &quot;coherent theory of clowning</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bondanella, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini,'' 192&lt;/ref&gt; As he saw it, the clown &quot;was always the caricature of a well-established, ordered, peaceful society</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bondanella, ''The Cinema of Federico Fellini,'' 193&lt;/ref&gt; The film‚Äôs opening scene anticipates ''Amarcord'' while its most surreal sequence involves an ecclesiastical fashion show in which nuns and priests roller skate past shipwrecks of cobwebbed skeletons</span>
				<span class='text'>ver a period of six months between January and June 1973, Fellini shot the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Amarcord]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Loosely based on the director‚Äôs 1968 autobiographical essay ''My Rimini'',&lt;ref&gt;Alpert, 239&lt;/ref&gt; the film depicts the adolescent Titta and his friends working out their sexual frustrations against the religious and Fascist backdrop of a provincial town in Italy during the 1930s</span>
				<span class='text'>Produced by [[Franco Cristaldi]], the [[seriocomic]] movie became Fellini‚Äôs second biggest commercial success after ''La Dolce Vita''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Alpert, 242&lt;/ref&gt; The director's overriding concern with developing a poetic form of cinema was first outlined in a 1965 interview he gave to ''[[The New Yorker]]'' journalist [[Lillian Ross (journalist)|Lillian Ross]]: &quot;I am trying to free my work from certain constrictions ‚Äì a story with a beginning, a development, an ending</span>
