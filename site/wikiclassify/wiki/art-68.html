				<span class='text'>--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for Franklin, his schooling ended when he was ten</span>
				<span class='text'>He worked for his father for a time, and at 12 he became an [[apprenticeship|apprentice]] to his brother James, a printer, who taught Ben the printing trade</span>
				<span class='text'>When Ben was 15, James founded ''[[The New-England Courant]]'', which was [[History of American newspapers|the first truly independent newspaper in the colonies]]</span>
				<span class='text'>hen denied the chance to write a letter to the paper for publication, Franklin adopted the pseudonym of &quot;[[Mrs</span>

				<span class='text'>Dogood's letters were published, and became a subject of conversation around town</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither James nor the ''Courant'''s readers were aware of the ruse, and James was unhappy with Ben when he discovered the popular correspondent was his younger brother</span>
				<span class='text'>Franklin was an advocate of free speech from an early age</span>
				<span class='text'>When his brother was jailed for three weeks in 1722 for publishing material unflattering to the governor, young Franklin took over the newspaper and had Mrs</span>
				<span class='text'>Dogood (quoting ''[[Cato's Letters]]'') proclaim: &quot;Without freedom of thought there can be no such thing as wisdom and no such thing as public liberty without freedom of speech</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Philadelphia==At age 17, Franklin ran away to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, seeking a new start in a new city</span>
				<span class='text'>When he first arrived, he worked in several printer shops around town, but he was not satisfied by the immediate prospects</span>
				<span class='text'>After a few months, while working in a printing house, Franklin was convinced by Pennsylvania Governor [[Sir William Keith, 4th Baronet|Sir William Keith]] to go to [[London]], ostensibly to acquire the equipment necessary for establishing another newspaper in Philadelphia</span>
				<span class='text'>Finding Keith's promises of backing a newspaper empty, Franklin worked as a [[typesetter]] in a printer's shop in what is now the [[St Bartholomew-the-Great|Church of St Bartholomew-the-Great]] in the [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] area of London</span>
				<span class='text'>Following this, he returned to Philadelphia in 1726 with the help of Thomas Denham, a merchant who employed Franklin as clerk, shopkeeper, and bookkeeper in his business</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;/&gt;===Junto and library===In 1727, Benjamin Franklin, then 21, created the [[Junto (club)|Junto]], a group of &quot;like minded aspiring artisans and tradesmen who hoped to improve themselves while they improved their community</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The Junto was a discussion group for issues of the day; it subsequently gave rise to many organizations in Philadelphia</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; ''Creativity research journal'' (2002) 14#2 pp: 253-266</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The Junto was modeled after English coffeehouses that Franklin knew well, and which should become the center of the spread of Enlightenment ideas in Britain</span>

				<span class='text'>The members created a library  initially assembled from their own books after Franklin wrote:A proposition was made by me that since our books were often referr'd to in our disquisitions upon the inquiries, it might be convenient for us to have them altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be consulted; and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we should, while we lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the advantage of using the books of all the other members, which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole</span>

				<span class='text'>Franklin conceived the idea of a [[subscription library]], which would pool the funds of the members to buy books for all to read</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the birth of the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]]: its charter was composed by Franklin in 1731</span>

				<span class='text'>]Upon Denham's death, Franklin returned to his former trade</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1728, Franklin had set up a printing house in partnership with [[Hugh Meredith]]; the following year he became the publisher of a newspaper called ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Gazette'' gave Franklin a forum for agitation about a variety of local reforms and initiatives through printed essays and observations</span>
				<span class='text'>Over time, his commentary, and his adroit cultivation of a positive image as an industrious and intellectual young man, earned him a great deal of social respect</span>
				<span class='text'>But even after Franklin had achieved fame as a scientist and statesman, he habitually signed his letters with the unpretentious 'B</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;/&gt;In 1732, Ben Franklin published the first [[German language]] newspaper in America – ''Die Philadelphische Zeitung'' – although it failed after only one year, because four other newly founded German papers quickly dominated the newspaper market</span>

				<span class='text'>Although Franklin apparently reconsidered shortly thereafter, and the phrases were omitted from all later printings of the pamphlet, his views may have played a role in his political defeat in 1764</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Franklin saw the printing press as a device to instruct colonial Americans in moral virtue</span>
				<span class='text'>Frasca argues he saw this as a service to God, because he understood moral virtue in terms of actions, thus, doing good provides a service to God</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his own moral lapses, Franklin saw himself as uniquely qualified to instruct Americans in morality</span>
				<span class='text'>He tried to influence American moral life through construction of a printing network based on a chain of partnerships from the Carolinas to New England</span>
				<span class='text'>Franklin thereby invented the first newspaper chain</span>
				<span class='text'>It was more than a business venture, for like many publishers since, he believed that the press had a public-service duty</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frasca | first1 = Ralph | year = 1997 | title = Benjamin Franklin's Journalism | url = | journal = [[Fides et Historia]] | volume = 29 | issue = 1| pages = 60–72 }}&lt;/ref&gt;When Franklin established himself in Philadelphia, shortly before 1730, the town boasted two &quot;wretched little&quot; news sheets, [[Andrew Bradford]]'s ''American Mercury'', and [[Samuel Keimer]]'s ''Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences, and Pennsylvania Gazette''</span>
				<span class='text'>This instruction in all arts and sciences consisted of weekly extracts from ''Chambers's Universal Dictionary''</span>
				<span class='text'>Franklin quickly did away with all this when he took over the ''Instructor'' and made it ''The Pennsylvania Gazette''</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Gazette'' soon became Franklin's characteristic organ, which he freely used for satire, for the play of his wit, even for sheer excess of mischief or of fun</span>
				<span class='text'>From the first he had a way of adapting his models to his own uses</span>
				<span class='text'>The series of essays called &quot;The Busy-Body&quot;, which he wrote for Bradford's ''American Mercury'' in 1729, followed the general [[Joseph Addison|Addisonian]] form, already modified to suit homelier conditions</span>
				<span class='text'>The thrifty Patience, in her busy little shop, complaining of the useless visitors who waste her valuable time, is related to the ladies who address Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Spectator</span>
				<span class='text'>The Busy-Body himself is a true Censor Morum, as [[Isaac Bickerstaff]] had been in the ''Tatler''</span>
				<span class='text'>And a number of the fictitious characters, Ridentius, Eugenius, Cato, and Cretico, represent traditional 18th-century classicism</span>
				<span class='text'>Even this Franklin could use for contemporary satire, since Cretico, the &quot;sowre Philosopher&quot;, is evidently a portrait of Franklin's rival, [[Samuel Keimer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>s time went on, Franklin depended less on his literary conventions, and more on his own native humor</span>
				<span class='text'>In this there is a new spirit—not suggested to him by the fine breeding of [[Joseph Addison|Addison]], or the bitter irony of [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], or the stinging completeness of [[Alexander Pope|Pope]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The brilliant little pieces Franklin wrote for his ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' have an imperishable place in American literature</span>
				<span class='text'>he ''Pennsylvania Gazette'', like most other newspapers of the period, was often poorly printed</span>
				<span class='text'>Franklin was busy with a hundred matters outside of his printing office, and never seriously attempted to raise the mechanical standards of his trade</span>
				<span class='text'>Nor did he ever properly edit or collate the chance medley of stale items that passed for news in the ''Gazette</span>
				<span class='text'>' His influence on the practical side of journalism was minimal</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand, his advertisements of books show his very great interest in popularizing secular literature</span>
				<span class='text'>Undoubtedly his paper contributed to the broader culture that distinguished Pennsylvania from her neighbors before the Revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>Like many publishers, Franklin built up a book shop in his printing office; he took the opportunity to read new books before selling them</span>
				<span class='text'>ranklin had mixed success in his plan to establish an inter-colonial network of newspapers that would produce a profit for him and disseminate virtue</span>

				<span class='text'>On May 10, 1752, [[Thomas-François Dalibard]] of France conducted Franklin's experiment using a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} iron rod instead of a kite, and he extracted electrical sparks from a cloud</span>

				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} On October 19 in a letter to England with directions for repeating the experiment, Franklin wrote:{{quote|When rain has wet the kite twine so that it can conduct the electric fire freely, you will find it streams out plentifully from the key at the approach of your knuckle, and with this key a phial, or [[Leyden jar]], may be charged: and from electric fire thus obtained spirits may be kindled, and all other electric experiments [may be] performed which are usually done by the help of a rubber glass globe or tube; and therefore the sameness of the electrical matter with that of lightening completely demonstrated</span>

				<span class='text'>He noted that conductors with a sharp rather than a smooth point could discharge silently, and at a far greater distance</span>
				<span class='text'>He surmised that this could help protect buildings from lightning by attaching &quot;upright Rods of Iron, made sharp as a Needle and gilt to prevent Rusting, and from the Foot of those Rods a Wire down the outside of the Building into the Ground;&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Would not these pointed Rods probably draw the Electrical Fire silently out of a Cloud before it came nigh enough to strike, and thereby secure us from that most sudden and terrible Mischief!&quot; Following a series of experiments on Franklin's own house, lightning rods were installed on the Academy of Philadelphia (later the [[University of Pennsylvania]]) and the Pennsylvania State House (later Independence Hall) in 1752</span>

				<span class='text'>]From the mid 1750s to the mid 1770s, Franklin spent much of his time in London</span>
				<span class='text'>Officially he was there on a political mission, but he used his time to further his scientific explorations as well, meeting many notable people</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1757, he was sent to England by the Pennsylvania Assembly as a colonial agent to protest against the political influence of the [[Penn family]], the [[proprietary colony|proprietors of the colony]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He remained there for five years, striving to end the proprietors' prerogative to overturn legislation from the elected Assembly, and their exemption from paying taxes on their land</span>
				<span class='text'>His lack of influential allies in [[Whitehall]] led to the failure of this mission</span>
				<span class='text'>t this time, many members of the Pennsylvania Assembly were feuding with [[List of colonial governors of Pennsylvania#Proprietors|William Penn's heirs]], who controlled the colony as proprietors</span>
				<span class='text'>After his return to the colony, Franklin led the &quot;anti-proprietary party&quot; in the struggle against the Penn family, and was elected [[Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives|Speaker of the Pennsylvania House]] in May 1764</span>
				<span class='text'>His call for a change from proprietary to royal government was a rare political miscalculation, however: Pennsylvanians worried that such a move would endanger their political and religious freedoms</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of these fears, and because of political attacks on his character, Franklin lost his seat in the October 1764 Assembly elections</span>
				<span class='text'>The anti-proprietary party dispatched Franklin to England again to continue the struggle against the Penn family proprietorship</span>
				<span class='text'>During this trip, events drastically changed the nature of his mission</span>

				<span class='text'>Unable to prevent its passage, he made another political miscalculation and recommended a friend to the post of stamp distributor for Pennsylvania</span>
				<span class='text'>Pennsylvanians were outraged, believing that he had supported the measure all along, and threatened to destroy his home in Philadelphia</span>

				<span class='text'>During his stays there, he developed a close friendship with his landlady, Margaret Stevenson, and her circle of friends and relations, in particular her daughter Mary, who was more often known as Polly</span>
				<span class='text'>Their house, which he used on various lengthy missions from 1757 to 1775, is the only one of his residences to survive</span>
				<span class='text'>It opened to the public as the [[Benjamin Franklin House]] museum in 2006</span>
				<span class='text'>Whilst in London, Franklin became involved in radical politics</span>
				<span class='text'>He belonged to a [[gentleman's club]] (which he called &quot;the honest Whigs&quot;), which held stated meetings, and included members such as [[Richard Price]], the minister of [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]] who ignited the [[Revolution Controversy]], and [[Andrew Kippis]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1756, Franklin had become a member of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce (now the [[Royal Society of Arts]] or RSA), which had been founded in 1754 and whose early meetings took place in [[English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries|Covent Garden coffee shops]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After his return to the United States in 1775, Franklin became the Society's Corresponding Member, continuing a close connection</span>
				<span class='text'>The RSA instituted a [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Royal Society of Arts)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] in 1956 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of his birth and the 200th anniversary of his membership of the RSA</span>
				<span class='text'>he study of [[natural philosophy]] (what we would call science) drew him into overlapping circles of acquaintance</span>
				<span class='text'>Franklin was, for example, a corresponding member of the [[Lunar Society of Birmingham]], which included such other scientific and industrial luminaries as [[Matthew Boulton]], [[James Watt]], [[Josiah Wedgwood]] and [[Erasmus Darwin]]; on occasion he visited them</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1762, [[Oxford University]] awarded Franklin an honorary doctorate for his scientific accomplishments; from then on he went by &quot;Doctor Franklin&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He also managed to secure an appointed post for his illegitimate son, [[William Franklin]], by then an attorney, as [[Governor of New Jersey|Colonial Governor of New Jersey]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;/&gt;While living in London in 1768, [[Benjamin Franklin's phonetic alphabet|he developed a phonetic alphabet]] in ''A Scheme for a new Alphabet and a Reformed Mode of Spelling''</span>
				<span class='text'>This reformed alphabet discarded six letters Franklin regarded as redundant (c, j, q, w, x, and y), and substituted six new letters for sounds he felt lacked letters of their own</span>
				<span class='text'>His new alphabet, however, never caught on, and he eventually lost interest</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;Benjamin Franklin: Champion of Generic Religion&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>62#4 2000</span>
				<span class='text'>pp</span>
				<span class='text'>722+&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin was a proponent of religion in general</span>
				<span class='text'>He prayed to &quot;Powerful Goodness&quot; and referred to God as &quot;the infinite&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>[[John Adams]] noted that Franklin was a mirror in which people saw their own religion: &quot;The [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] thought him almost a Catholic</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Church of England]] claimed him as one of them</span>
				<span class='text'>The [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] thought him half a Presbyterian, and the [[Quakers|Friends]] believed him a wet Quaker</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Whatever else Franklin was, concludes Morgan, &quot;he was a true champion of generic religion</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In a letter to Richard Price, Franklin stated that he believed that religion should support itself without help from the government, claiming, &quot;When a Religion is good, I conceive that it will support itself; and, when it cannot support itself, and God does not take care to support, so that its Professors are oblig'd to call for the help of the Civil Power, it is a sign, I apprehend, of its being a bad one</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin to Richard Price, October 9, 1780 ''Writings'' 8:153–54&lt;/ref&gt;In 1790, just about a month before he died, Franklin wrote a letter to [[Ezra Stiles]], president of [[Yale University]], who had asked him his views on religion:{{quote|As to [[Jesus of Nazareth]], my Opinion of whom you particularly desire, I think the System of Morals and his Religion, as he left them to us, the best the world ever saw or is likely to see; but I apprehend it has received various corrupt changes, and I have, with most of the present [[English Dissenters|Dissenters in England]], some Doubts as to his divinity; tho' it is a question I do not dogmatize upon, having never studied it, and I think it needless to busy myself with it now, when I expect soon an Opportunity of knowing the Truth with less Trouble</span>
				<span class='text'>I see no harm, however, in its being believed, if that belief has the good consequence, as it probably has, of making his doctrines more respected and better observed; especially as I do not perceive that the Supreme takes it amiss, by distinguishing the unbelievers in his government of the world with any particular marks of his displeasure</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;vandoren&quot;/&gt;}}On July 4, 1776, Congress appointed a three-member committee composed of Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams to design the [[Great Seal of the United States]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Franklin's proposal (which was not adopted) featured the motto: &quot;Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God&quot; and a scene from the [[Book of Exodus]], with [[Moses]], the [[Israelites]], the [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]], and [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] depicted as [[pharaoh]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The design that was produced was never acted upon by Congress, and the Great Seal's design was not finalized until a third committee was appointed in 1782</span>

				<span class='text'>His [[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin|autobiography]] lists his 13 virtues as:# &quot;[[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;# &quot;Resolution</span>
				<span class='text'>Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;# &quot;[[Frugality]]</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> waste nothing</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;# &quot;Industry</span>
				<span class='text'>Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;# &quot;[[Sincerity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;# &quot;[[Justice]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;# &quot;[[Moderation]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;# &quot;[[Cleanliness]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or habitation</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;# &quot;[[Tranquility]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;# &quot;[[Chastity]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Rarely use [[Human sexuality|venery]] but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;# &quot;[[Humility]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Imitate Jesus and [[Socrates]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Franklin did not try to work on them all at once</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, he would work on one and only one each week &quot;leaving all others to their ordinary chance</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; While Franklin did not live completely by his virtues, and by his own admission he fell short of them many times, he believed the attempt made him a better man contributing greatly to his success and happiness, which is why in his autobiography, he devoted more pages to this plan than to any other single point; in his autobiography Franklin wrote, &quot;I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit</span>

				<span class='text'>The trust began in 1785 when the French mathematician [[Charles-Joseph Mathon de la Cour]], who admired Franklin greatly, wrote a friendly [[parody]] of Franklin's &quot;Poor Richard's Almanack&quot; called &quot;Fortunate Richard&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The main character leaves a smallish amount of money in his will, five lots of 100 ''[[French livre|livres]]'', to collect interest over one, two, three, four or five full centuries, with the resulting astronomical sums to be spent on impossibly elaborate utopian projects</span>
