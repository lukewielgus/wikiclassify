				<span class='text'>Franklin saw the printing press as a device to instruct colonial Americans in moral virtue</span>
				<span class='text'>Frasca argues he saw this as a service to God because he understood moral virtue in terms of actions thus doing good provides a service to God</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite his own moral lapses Franklin saw himself as uniquely qualified to instruct Americans in morality</span>
				<span class='text'>He tried to influence American moral life through construction of a printing network based on a chain of partnerships from the Carolinas to New England</span>
				<span class='text'>Franklin thereby invented the first newspaper chain</span>
				<span class='text'>It was more than a business venture for like many publishers since he believed that the press had a public service duty</span>
				<span class='text'>When Franklin established himself in Philadelphia shortly before 1730 the town boasted two wretched little news sheets s American Mercury and s Universal Instructor in all Arts and Sciences and Pennsylvania Gazette</span>
				<span class='text'>This instruction in all arts and sciences consisted of weekly extracts from Chamberss Universal Dictionary</span>
				<span class='text'>Franklin quickly did away with all this when he took over the Instructor and made it The Pennsylvania Gazette</span>
				<span class='text'>The Gazette soon became Franklins characteristic organ which he freely used for satire for the play of his wit even for sheer excess of mischief or of fun</span>
				<span class='text'>From the first he had a way of adapting his models to his own uses</span>
				<span class='text'>The series of essays called The Busy Body which he wrote for Bradfords American Mercury in 1729 followed the general  form already modified to suit homelier conditions</span>
				<span class='text'>The thrifty Patience in her busy little shop complaining of the useless visitors who waste her valuable time is related to the ladies who address Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Spectator</span>
				<span class='text'>The Busy Body himself is a true Censor Morum as  had been in the Tatler</span>
				<span class='text'>And a number of the fictitious characters Ridentius Eugenius Cato and Cretico represent traditional 18th century classicism</span>
				<span class='text'>Even this Franklin could use for contemporary satire since Cretico the sowre Philosopher is evidently a portrait of Franklins rival </span>
				<span class='text'>s time went on Franklin depended less on his literary conventions and more on his own native humor</span>
				<span class='text'>In this there is a new spirit—not suggested to him by the fine breeding of  or the bitter irony of  or the stinging completeness of </span>
				<span class='text'>The brilliant little pieces Franklin wrote for his Pennsylvania Gazette have an imperishable place in American literature</span>
				<span class='text'>he Pennsylvania Gazette like most other newspapers of the period was often poorly printed</span>
				<span class='text'>Franklin was busy with a hundred matters outside of his printing office and never seriously attempted to raise the mechanical standards of his trade</span>
				<span class='text'>Nor did he ever properly edit or collate the chance medley of stale items that passed for news in the Gazette</span>
				<span class='text'>His influence on the practical side of journalism was minimal</span>
				<span class='text'>On the other hand his advertisements of books show his very great interest in popularizing secular literature</span>
				<span class='text'>Undoubtedly his paper contributed to the broader culture that distinguished Pennsylvania from her neighbors before the Revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>Like many publishers Franklin built up a book shop in his printing office he took the opportunity to read new books before selling them</span>
				<span class='text'>ranklin had mixed success in his plan to establish an inter colonial network of newspapers that would produce a profit for him and disseminate virtue</span>
