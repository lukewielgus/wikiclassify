				<span class='text'>heory of warClausewitz was a professional combat soldier who was involved in numerous military campaigns but he is famous primarily as a military theorist interested in the examination of war utilizing the campaigns of  and Napoleon as frames of erence for his work</span>
				<span class='text'> He wrote a caul systematic philosophical examination of war in all its aspects</span>
				<span class='text'>The result was his principal book  a major work on the philosophy of war</span>
				<span class='text'>It was unfinished when Clausewitz died and contains material written at different stages in his intellectual evolution producing some significant contradictions between different sections</span>
				<span class='text'>The sequence and precise character of that evolution is a source of much debate as are exact meaning behind his seemingly contradictory claims discussions pertinent to the tactical operational and strategic levels of war are one example</span>
				<span class='text'>Clausewitz constantly sought to revise the text particularly between 1827 and his departure on his last field assignments to include more material on peoples war and forms of war other than high intensity warfare between states but relatively little of this material was included in the book</span>
				<span class='text'>name smith57   Soldiers before this time had written treatises on various military subjects but none had undertaken a great philosophical examination of war on the scale of those written by Clausewitz and  both of which were inspired by the events of the </span>
				<span class='text'>lausewitzs work is still studied today demonstrating its continued relevance</span>
				<span class='text'>More than sixteen major English language books that focused specifically on his work were published between 2005 and 2014 whereas his 19th century rival  faded from influence</span>
				<span class='text'> writing on that topic in War Through the Ages 1960 said This outcome</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>may be explained by the fact that  produced a system of war Clausewitz a philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'> The one has been outdated by new weapons the other still influences the strategy behind those weapons</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Jomini also wrote extensively on war he was primarily a historian and journalist and did not attempt to define war</span>
				<span class='text'>Clausewitz did providing and dialectically comparing a number of definitions</span>
				<span class='text'>The first is his dialectical thesis War is thus an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will</span>
				<span class='text'>The second often treated as Clausewitzs bottom line is in fact merely his dialectical antithesis War is merely the continuation of policy by other means</span>
				<span class='text'>The synthesis of his dialectical examination of the nature of war is his famous trinity saying that war is a fascinating trinity‚Äîcomposed of primordial violence hatred and enmity which are to be regarded as a blind natural force the play of chance and probability within which the creative spirit is free to roam and its element of subordination as an instrument of policy which makes it subject to pure reason</span>

				<span class='text'>he degree to which Clausewitz managed to revise his manuscript to lect that synthesis is the subject of much debate</span>
				<span class='text'>His final erence to war and Politik however goes beyond his widely quoted antithesis War is simply the continuation of political intercourse with the addition of other means</span>
				<span class='text'>We deliberately use the phrase with the addition of other means because we also want to make it clear that war in itself does not suspend political intercourse or change it into something entirely different</span>
				<span class='text'>In essentials that intercourse continues irrespective of the means it employs</span>
				<span class='text'>The main lines along which military events progress and to which they are restricted are political lines that continue throughout the war into the subsequent peace</span>
				<span class='text'>lausewitz introduced systematic philosophical contemplation into Western military thinking with powerful implications not only for historical and analytical writing but also for practical policy military instruction and operational planning</span>
				<span class='text'>He relied on his own experiences contemporary writings about Napoleon and on deep historical research</span>
				<span class='text'>His historiographical approach is evident in his first extended study written when he was 25 of the </span>
				<span class='text'>He rejects the s view of the war as a chaotic muddle and instead explains its drawn out operations by the  and  of the age the social characteristics of the troops and the commanders politics and psychology</span>
				<span class='text'>In On War Clausewitz sees all wars as the sum of decisions actions and reactions in an uncertain and dangerous context and also as a socio political phenomenon</span>
				<span class='text'>He also stressed the complex nature of war which encompasses both the socio political and the operational and stresses the primacy of state policy</span>
				<span class='text'>he word  had only recently come into usage in modern Europe and Clausewitzs definition is quite narrow the use of engagements for the object of war</span>
				<span class='text'>Clausewitz conceived of war as a political social and military phenomenon which might ‚Äî depending on circumstances ‚Äî involve the entire population of a nation at war</span>
				<span class='text'>In any case Clausewitz saw military force as an instrument that states and other political actors use to pursue the ends of policy in a dialectic between opposing wills each with the aim of imposing his policies and will upon his enemy</span>

				<span class='text'>132 163</span>
				<span class='text'>Clausewitzs emphasis on the inherent superiority of the defense suggests that habitual aggressors are likely to end up as failures</span>
				<span class='text'>The inherent superiority of the defense obviously does not mean that the defender will always win however there are other asymmetries to be considered</span>
				<span class='text'>He was interested in cooperation between the regular army and militia or partisan forces or citizen soldiers as one possible ‚Äî sometimes the only ‚Äî method of defense</span>
				<span class='text'>In the circumstances of the Wars of the French Revolution and with Napoleon which were energized by a rising spirit of nationalism he emphasized the need for states to involve their entire populations in the conduct of war</span>
				<span class='text'>This point is especially important as these wars demonstrated that such energies could be of decisive importance and for a time led to a democratization of the armed forces much as universal suffrage democratized politics</span>
				<span class='text'>hile Clausewitz was intensely aware of the value of intelligence at all levels he was also very skeptical of the accuracy of much military intelligence Many intelligence reports in war are contradictory even more are false and most are uncertain</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> In short most intelligence is false</span>
				<span class='text'>This circumstance is generally described as part of the </span>
				<span class='text'>Such skeptical comments apply only to intelligence at the tactical and operational levels at the strategic and political levels he constantly stressed the requirement for the best possible understanding of what today would be called strategic and political intelligence</span>
				<span class='text'>His conclusions were influenced by his experiences in the Prussian Army which was often in an intelligence fog due partly to the superior abilities of Napoleons system but even more to the nature of war</span>
				<span class='text'> Clausewitz acknowledges that friction creates enormous difficulties for the realization of any plan and the fog of war hinders commanders from knowing what is happening</span>
				<span class='text'>It is precisely in the context of this challenge that he develops the concept of military genius whose capabilities are seen above all in the execution of operations</span>
				<span class='text'>Military genius is not simply a matter of intellect but a combination of qualities of intellect experience personality and temperament and there are many possible such combinations that create a very highly developed mental aptitude for the waging of war</span>
				<span class='text'>ey ideas discussed in On War include the dialectical approach to military analysis the methods of critical analysis the economic profit seeking logic of commercial enterprise is equally applicable to the waging of war and negotiating for peace the nature of the balance of power mechanism the relationship between political objectives and military objectives in war the asymmetrical relationship between attack and defense the nature of military genius involving matters of personality and character beyond intellect the fascinating trinity wunderliche Dreifaltigkeit of warhttp  www</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Clausewitzs theory of war was expounded in a way too abstract and involved for ordinary soldier minds essentially concrete to follow the course of his argument  which often turned back from the direction in which it was apparently leading</span>
				<span class='text'> Impressed yet befogged they grasped at his vivid leading phrases seeing only their surface meaning and missing the deeper current of his thought</span>

				<span class='text'>ed</span>
				<span class='text'> blockquoteAs described by  then professor of strategy at the  of the United StatesblockquoteOne of the main sources of confusion about Clausewitzs approach lies in his dialectical method of presentation</span>
				<span class='text'>For example Clausewitzs famous line that War is a mere continuation of politics by other means Der Krieg ist eine blo√üe Fortsetzung der Politik mit anderen Mitteln while accurate as far as it goes was not intended as a statement of fact</span>
				<span class='text'>It is the antithesis in a dialectical argument whose thesis is the point  made earlier in the analysis  that war is nothing but a duel or wrestling match a better translation of the German Zweikampf on a larger scale</span>
				<span class='text'>His synthesis which resolves the deficiencies of these two bold statements says that war is neither nothing but an act of brute force nor merely a rational act of politics or policy</span>
				<span class='text'>This synthesis lies in his fascinating trinity wunderliche Dreifaltigkeit a dynamic inherently unstable interaction of the forces of violent emotion chance and rational calculation</span>
				<span class='text'>name bassford   blockquoteAnother example of this confusion is the idea that Clausewitz was a proponent of  as used in the Third Reichs propaganda in the 1940s</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact he never used the term total war rather he discussed absolute war or ideal war as the purely logical result of the forces underlying a pure Platonic ideal of war</span>
				<span class='text'>In what he called a logical fantasy war cannot be waged in a limited way the rules of competition will force participants to use all means at their disposal to achieve victory</span>
				<span class='text'>But in the real world he said such rigid logic is unrealistic and dangerous</span>
				<span class='text'>As a practical matter the military objectives in real war that support political objectives generally fall into two broad types war to achieve limited aims and war to disarm the enemy to render him politically helpless or militarily impotent</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus the complete defeat of the enemy may not be necessary desirable or even possible</span>
				<span class='text'>n modern times the reconstruction of Clausewitzian theory has been a matter of much dispute</span>
				<span class='text'>One analysis was that of  a Greek German writer and philosopher who opposed the interpretations of  in Penser la Guerre Clausewitz and other liberal writers</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Aron Clausewitz was one of the first writers to condemn the militarism of the Prussian general staff and its war proneness based on Clausewitzs argument that war is a continuation of politics by other means</span>
				<span class='text'>In Theory of War Kondylis claims that this is inconsistent with Clausewitzian thought</span>
				<span class='text'>He claims that Clausewitz was morally indifferent to war though this probably lects a lack of familiarity with personal letters from Clausewitz which demonstrate an acute awareness of wars tragic aspects and that his advice regarding politics dominance over the conduct of war has nothing to do with pacifist ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>For Clausewitz war is simply one unique means that is sometimes applied to the eternal quest for power of raison d√âtat in an anarchic and unsafe world</span>
				<span class='text'>ther notable writers who have studied Clausewitzs texts and translated them into English are historians  of the  and  and the philosopher musician and  </span>
				<span class='text'>Howard and Paret edited the most widely used edition of On War Princeton University Press 1976 1984 and have produced comparative studies of Clausewitz and other theorists such as Tolstoy</span>
				<span class='text'>s A Guide to the Reading of On War in the 1976 Princeton translation expressed his interpretations of the Prussians theories and provided students with an influential synopsis of this vital work</span>

				<span class='text'>ohn Keegan </span>
				<span class='text'>1993</span>
				<span class='text'>Second edition 2004 page 3</span>
				<span class='text'> Keegan argued that Clausewitz assumed the existence of states yet war antedates the state diplomacy and strategy by many millennia</span>
				<span class='text'>nfluenceClausewitz died without completing On War but despite this his ideas have been widely influential in  and have had a strong influence on German military thought specifically</span>
				<span class='text'>Later Prussian and German generals such as  were clearly influenced by Clausewitz Moltkes widely quoted statement that No campaign plan survives first contact with the enemy is a classic lection of Clausewitzs insistence on the roles of chance friction fog uncertainty and interactivity in war</span>

				<span class='text'> While it may seem contradictory that major states expended so much blood and treasure in pursuit of what now seem such limited political objectives this is probably better seen as a reason to listen to Clausewitz than to consider his theories wrong</span>

				<span class='text'>Rapoport argued thatblockquoteAs for Lenins approval of Clausewitz it probably stems from his obsession with the struggle for power</span>
				<span class='text'>The whole Marxist conception of history is that of successive struggles for power primarily between social classes</span>
				<span class='text'>This was constantly applied by Lenin in a variety of contexts</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus the entire history of philosophy appears in Lenins writings as a vast struggle between idealism and materialism</span>
				<span class='text'>The fate of the socialist movement was to be decided by a struggle between the revolutionists and the ormers</span>
				<span class='text'>Clausewitzs acceptance of the struggle for power as the essence of international politics must had impressed Lenin as starkly realistic</span>

				<span class='text'>The idea that war involves inherent friction that distorts to a greater or lesser degree all prior arrangements has become common currency in fields such as business strategy and sport</span>
				<span class='text'>The phrase  derives from Clausewitzs stress on how confused warfare can seem while immersed within it</span>

				<span class='text'> Eisenhower was greatly impressed by Clausewitz‚Äôs example of a theoretical idealized ‚Äúabsolute war‚Äù in Vom Krieg as a way of demonstrating how absurd it would be to attempt such a strategy in practice</span>
				<span class='text'>name Gaddis 1997 page 233  For Eisenhower the age of nuclear weapons had made what was for Clausewitz in the early 19th century only a theoretical vision an all too real possibility in the mid 20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>name Gaddis 1997 page 233  From Eisenhower‚Äôs viewpoint the best deterrent to war was to show the world just how appalling and horrific a nuclear ‚Äúabsolute war‚Äù would be if it should ever occur hence a series of much publicized nuclear tests in the Pacific giving first priority in the defense budget to nuclear weapons and delivery systems over conventional weapons and making repeated statements in public that the United States was able and willing at all times to use nuclear weapons</span>
				<span class='text'>name Gaddis 1997 page 233  In this way through the  doctrine and the closely related foreign policy concept of  Eisenhower hoped to hold out a creditable vision of Clausewitzian nuclear ‚Äúabsolute war‚Äù in order to deter the Soviet Union and or China from ever risking a war or even conditions that might lead to a war with the United States</span>

				<span class='text'>If Clausewitz had focused solely on wars between countries with well defined armies as many commentators have argued then perhaps On War has lost its analytical edge as a tool for understanding war as it is currently fought</span>

				<span class='text'>Clausewitz wrote a series of ‚ÄúLectures on Small War‚Äù and studied the rebellion in the Vend√©e 1793‚Äì1796 and the Tyrolean uprising of 1809</span>
				<span class='text'>In his famous ‚ÄúBekenntnisdenkschrift‚Äù of 1812 he called for a ‚ÄúSpanish war in Germany‚Äù and laid out a comprehensive guerrilla strategy to be waged against Napoleon</span>

				<span class='text'>Daniel Moran replied The most egregious misrepresentation of Clausewitz‚Äôs famous metaphor must be that of Martin van Creveld who has declared Clausewitz to be an apostle of Trinitarian War by which he means incomprehensibly a war of state against state and army against army from which the influence of the people is entirely excluded</span>
