				<span class='text'>Like many Prussian officers serving in Russia, he joined the [[Russian-German Legion]] in 1813</span>
				<span class='text'>In the service of the [[Russian Empire]], Clausewitz helped negotiate the [[Convention of Tauroggen]] (1812), which prepared the way for the coalition of Prussia, Russia, and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] that ultimately defeated Napoleon and his allies</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1815, the Russo-German Legion was integrated into the Prussian Army and Clausewitz re-entered Prussian service as a colonel</span>
				<span class='text'>He was soon appointed chief of staff of [[Johann von Thielmann]]'s III Corps</span>
				<span class='text'>In that capacity, he served at the [[Battle of Ligny]] and the [[Battle of Wavre]] during the [[Waterloo Campaign]] in 1815</span>
				<span class='text'> The Prussians were defeated at [[Ligny]] (south of [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] and the village of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]]) by an army led personally by Napoleon, but Napoleon's failure to destroy the Prussian forces led to his defeat a few days later at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], when the Prussian forces unexpectedly arrived on his right flank late in the afternoon to support the Anglo-Dutch-Belgian forces pressing his front</span>
				<span class='text'>Clausewitz's unit fought at [[Battle of Wavre|Wavre]], preventing large reinforcements from reaching Napoleon at Waterloo</span>
				<span class='text'>lausewitz was promoted to Major-General in 1818 and appointed director of the ''[[Prussian Military Academy|Kriegsakademie]]'', where he served until 1830</span>
				<span class='text'>In that year, he returned to duty with the army</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon afterwards, the outbreak of several revolutions around Europe and [[November Uprising|a crisis in Poland]] appeared to presage another major European war</span>
				<span class='text'>Clausewitz was appointed chief of staff of the only army Prussia was able to mobilize in this emergency, which was sent to the Polish border</span>
				<span class='text'>Its commander, Gneisenau, died of cholera and Clausewitz took command of the Prussian army's efforts to construct a ''cordon sanitaire'' to contain the great [[cholera]] outbreak in 1831 (the first time cholera had appeared in Europe, causing a continent-wide panic)</span>

				<span class='text'>=Theory of war==Clausewitz was a professional combat soldier who was involved in numerous military campaigns, but he is famous primarily as a military theorist interested in the examination of war, utilizing the campaigns of [[Frederick the Great]] and Napoleon as frames of reference for his work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paret | first1 = Peter | year = 2012 | title = Clausewitz and Schlieffen as Interpreters of Frederick the Great: Three Phases in the History of Grand Strategy | url = | journal = Journal of Military History | volume = 76 | issue = 3| pages = 837–845 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a careful, systematic, philosophical examination of war in all its aspects</span>
				<span class='text'>The result was his principal book, ''[[On War]],'' a major work on the philosophy of war</span>
				<span class='text'>It was unfinished when Clausewitz died and contains material written at different stages in his intellectual evolution, producing some significant contradictions between different sections</span>
				<span class='text'>The sequence and precise character of that evolution is a source of much debate, as are exact meaning behind his seemingly contradictory claims (discussions pertinent to the tactical, operational and strategic levels of war are one example)</span>
				<span class='text'>Clausewitz constantly sought to revise the text, particularly between 1827 and his departure on his last field assignments, to include more material on &quot;people's war&quot; and forms of war other than high-intensity warfare between states, but relatively little of this material was included in the book</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=smith57 /&gt; Soldiers before this time had written treatises on various military subjects, but none had undertaken a great philosophical examination of war on the scale of those written by Clausewitz and [[Leo Tolstoy]], both of which were inspired by the events of the [[Napoleonic Era]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lausewitz's work is still studied today, demonstrating its continued relevance</span>
				<span class='text'>More than sixteen major English-language books that focused specifically on his work were published between 2005 and 2014, whereas his 19th-century rival [[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Jomini]] faded from influence</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Lynn Montross]], writing on that topic in ''War Through the Ages'' (1960), said; &quot;This outcome</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>may be explained by the fact that [[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Jomini]] produced a system of war, Clausewitz a philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'> The one has been outdated by new weapons, the other still influences the strategy behind those weapons</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{Page needed|date=June 2011}} Although Jomini also wrote extensively on war, he was primarily a historian and journalist and did not attempt to define war</span>
				<span class='text'>Clausewitz did, providing (and dialectically comparing) a number of definitions</span>
				<span class='text'>The first is his dialectical thesis: &quot;War is thus an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The second, often treated as Clausewitz's 'bottom line,' is in fact merely his dialectical antithesis: &quot;War is merely the continuation of policy by other means</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The synthesis of his dialectical examination of the nature of war is his famous &quot;trinity,&quot; saying that war is &quot;a fascinating trinity—composed of primordial violence, hatred, and enmity, which are to be regarded as a blind natural force; the play of chance and probability, within which the creative spirit is free to roam; and its element of subordination, as an instrument of policy, which makes it subject to pure reason</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carl von Clausewitz, ''On War'', originally ''Vom Kriege'' (3 vols</span>
				<span class='text'> Berlin: 1832-34)</span>
				<span class='text'>The edition cited here was edited by Michael Howard and Peter Paret, Princeton University Press, 1984, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>5,87,89,605</span>
				<span class='text'>The language describing the 'trinity,' however, has been modified in accordance with Christopher Bassford's critique of the Howard/Paret translation in &quot;The Primacy of Policy and the 'Trinity' in Clausewitz's Mature Thought,&quot; from Hew Strachan and Andreas Herberg-Rothe, eds</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Clausewitz in the Twenty-First Century'' [Proceedings of a March, 2005 conference at Oxford] (Oxford University Press, 2007), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>4-90</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Thus the best shorthand for Clausewitz's trinity should be something like &quot;violent emotion/chance/rational calculation</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; However, it is frequently presented as &quot;people/army/government,&quot; a misunderstanding based on a later paragraph in the same chapter</span>
				<span class='text'>This misrepresentation was popularized by U</span>

				<span class='text'>Army Colonel Harry Summers' Vietnam-era interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;Summers, Harry G</span>
				<span class='text'> Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>''On Strategy: A Critical Analysis of the Vietnam War'' (Novato, CA: Presidio Press, 1982)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; facilitated by weaknesses in the 1976 Howard/Paret translation</span>
				<span class='text'>he degree to which Clausewitz managed to revise his manuscript to reflect that synthesis is the subject of much debate</span>
				<span class='text'>His final reference to war and ''Politik'', however, goes beyond his widely quoted antithesis: &quot;War is simply the continuation of political intercourse with the addition of other means</span>
				<span class='text'>We deliberately use the phrase &quot;with the addition of other means&quot; because we also want to make it clear that war in itself does not suspend political intercourse or change it into something entirely different</span>
				<span class='text'>In essentials that intercourse continues, irrespective of the means it employs</span>
				<span class='text'>The main lines along which military events progress, and to which they are restricted, are political lines that continue throughout the war into the subsequent peace</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Clausewitz introduced systematic philosophical contemplation into Western military thinking, with powerful implications not only for historical and analytical writing but also for practical policy, military instruction, and operational planning</span>
				<span class='text'>He relied on his own experiences, contemporary writings about Napoleon, and on deep historical research</span>
				<span class='text'>His historiographical approach is evident in his first extended study, written when he was 25, of the [[Thirty Years War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He rejects the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s view of the war as a chaotic muddle and instead explains its drawn-out operations by the [[economy]] and [[technology]] of the age, the social characteristics of the troops, and the commanders' politics and psychology</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''On War'', Clausewitz sees all wars as the sum of decisions, actions, and reactions in an uncertain and dangerous context, and also as a socio-political phenomenon</span>
				<span class='text'>He also stressed the complex nature of war, which encompasses both the socio-political and the operational and stresses the primacy of state policy</span>
				<span class='text'>he word &quot;[[strategy]]&quot; had only recently come into usage in modern Europe, and Clausewitz's definition is quite narrow: &quot;the use of engagements for the object of war</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Clausewitz conceived of war as a political, social, and military phenomenon which might — depending on circumstances — involve the entire population of a nation at war</span>
				<span class='text'>In any case, Clausewitz saw military force as an instrument that states and other political actors use to pursue the ends of policy, in a dialectic between opposing wills, each with the aim of imposing his policies and will upon his enemy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;Beatrice Heuser, &quot;Clausewitz’ Ideas of Strategy and Victory&quot;, in Andreas Herberg-Rothe and Hew Strachan (eds): ''Clausewitz in the 21st Century'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>132-163</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Clausewitz's emphasis on the inherent superiority of the defense suggests that habitual aggressors are likely to end up as failures</span>
				<span class='text'>The inherent superiority of the defense obviously does not mean that the defender will always win, however: there are other asymmetries to be considered</span>
				<span class='text'>He was interested in cooperation between the regular army and militia or partisan forces, or citizen soldiers, as one possible — sometimes the only — method of defense</span>
				<span class='text'>In the circumstances of the Wars of the French Revolution and with Napoleon, which were energized by a rising spirit of nationalism, he emphasized the need for states to involve their entire populations in the conduct of war</span>
				<span class='text'>This point is especially important, as these wars demonstrated that such energies could be of decisive importance and for a time led to a democratization of the armed forces much as universal suffrage democratized politics</span>
				<span class='text'>hile Clausewitz was intensely aware of the value of intelligence at all levels, he was also very skeptical of the accuracy of much military intelligence: &quot;Many intelligence reports in war are contradictory; even more are false, and most are uncertain</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> In short, most intelligence is false</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This circumstance is generally described as part of the [[fog of war]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Such skeptical comments apply only to intelligence at the tactical and operational levels; at the strategic and political levels he constantly stressed the requirement for the best possible understanding of what today would be called strategic and political intelligence</span>
				<span class='text'>His conclusions were influenced by his experiences in the Prussian Army, which was often in an intelligence fog due partly to the superior abilities of Napoleon's system but even more to the nature of war</span>
				<span class='text'> Clausewitz acknowledges that friction creates enormous difficulties for the realization of any plan, and the ''fog of war'' hinders commanders from knowing what is happening</span>
				<span class='text'>It is precisely in the context of this challenge that he develops the concept of military genius, whose capabilities are seen above all in the execution of operations</span>
				<span class='text'>'Military genius' is not simply a matter of intellect, but a combination of qualities of intellect, experience, personality, and temperament (and there are many possible such combinations) that create a very highly developed mental aptitude for the waging of war</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> [Clausewitz's] theory of war was expounded in a way too abstract and involved for ordinary soldier-minds, essentially concrete, to follow the course of his argument &amp;ndash; which often turned back from the direction in which it was apparently leading</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As described by [[Christopher Bassford]], then professor of strategy at the [[National War College]] of the United States:&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the main sources of confusion about Clausewitz's approach lies in his dialectical method of presentation</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, Clausewitz's famous line that &quot;War is a mere continuation of politics by other means,&quot; (&quot;Der Krieg ist eine bloße Fortsetzung der Politik mit anderen Mitteln&quot;) while accurate as far as it goes, was not intended as a statement of fact</span>
				<span class='text'>It is the antithesis in a dialectical argument whose thesis is the point &amp;ndash; made earlier in the analysis &amp;ndash; that &quot;war is nothing but a duel [or wrestling match, a better translation of the German ''Zweikampf''] on a larger scale</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; His synthesis, which resolves the deficiencies of these two bold statements, says that war is neither &quot;nothing but&quot; an act of brute force nor &quot;merely&quot; a rational act of politics or policy</span>
				<span class='text'>This synthesis lies in his &quot;fascinating trinity&quot; [wunderliche Dreifaltigkeit]: a dynamic, inherently unstable interaction of the forces of violent emotion, chance, and rational calculation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=bassford /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Another example of this confusion is the idea that Clausewitz was a proponent of [[total war]] as used in the Third Reich's propaganda in the 1940s</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, he never used the term &quot;total war&quot;: rather, he discussed &quot;absolute war&quot; or &quot;ideal war&quot; as the purely ''logical'' result of the forces underlying a &quot;pure,&quot; Platonic &quot;ideal&quot; of war</span>
				<span class='text'>In what he called a &quot;logical fantasy,&quot; war cannot be waged in a limited way: the rules of competition will force participants to use all means at their disposal to achieve victory</span>
				<span class='text'>But in the ''real world'', he said, such rigid logic is unrealistic and dangerous</span>
				<span class='text'>As a practical matter, the military objectives in ''real'' war that support political objectives generally fall into two broad types: &quot;war to achieve limited aims&quot;; and war to &quot;disarm&quot; the enemy, &quot;to render [him] politically helpless or militarily impotent</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Thus the complete defeat of the enemy may not be necessary, desirable, or even possible</span>
				<span class='text'>n modern times the reconstruction of Clausewitzian theory has been a matter of much dispute</span>
				<span class='text'>One analysis was that of [[Panagiotis Kondylis]], a Greek-German writer and philosopher, who opposed the interpretations of [[Raymond Aron]] in ''Penser la Guerre, Clausewitz'', and other liberal writers</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Aron, Clausewitz was one of the first writers to condemn the militarism of the Prussian general staff and its war-proneness, based on Clausewitz's argument that &quot;war is a continuation of politics by other means</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In ''Theory of War,'' Kondylis claims that this is inconsistent with Clausewitzian thought</span>
				<span class='text'>He claims that Clausewitz was morally indifferent to war (though this probably reflects a lack of familiarity with personal letters from Clausewitz, which demonstrate an acute awareness of war's tragic aspects) and that his advice regarding politics' dominance over the conduct of war has nothing to do with pacifist ideas</span>
				<span class='text'>For Clausewitz, war is simply one unique means that is sometimes applied to the eternal quest for power, of ''raison d'État'' in an anarchic and unsafe world</span>
				<span class='text'>ther notable writers who have studied Clausewitz's texts and translated them into English are historians [[Peter Paret]] of the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] and [[Michael Howard (historian)|Sir Michael Howard]], and the philosopher, musician, and [[game theory|game theorist]] [[Anatol Rapoport]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Howard and Paret edited the most widely used edition of ''On War'' (Princeton University Press, 1976/1984) and have produced comparative studies of Clausewitz and other theorists, such as Tolstoy</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Bernard Brodie (military strategist)|Bernard Brodie]]'s ''A Guide to the Reading of &quot;On War&quot;'', in the 1976 Princeton translation, expressed his interpretations of the Prussian's theories and provided students with an influential synopsis of this vital work</span>
				<span class='text'>he British military historian [[John Keegan]] attacked Clausewitz's theory in his book ''[[A History of Warfare]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;John Keegan, ''[[A History of Warfare]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>1993</span>
				<span class='text'>Second edition 2004, page 3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Keegan argued that Clausewitz assumed the existence of states, yet 'war antedates the state, diplomacy and strategy by many millennia</span>
				<span class='text'>==Influence==Clausewitz died without completing ''On War'', but despite this his ideas have been widely influential in [[military theory]] and have had a strong influence on German military thought specifically</span>
				<span class='text'>Later Prussian and German generals, such as [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmuth Graf von Moltke]], were clearly influenced by Clausewitz: Moltke's widely quoted statement that &quot;No campaign plan survives first contact with the enemy&quot; is a classic reflection of Clausewitz's insistence on the roles of chance, friction, &quot;fog,&quot; uncertainty, and interactivity in war</span>
				<span class='text'>lausewitz's influence spread to British thinking as well, though at first more as an historian and analyst than as a theorist</span>

				<span class='text'>Clausewitz's broader thinking came to the fore following Britain's military embarrassments in the Boer War (1899-1902)</span>
				<span class='text'>One example of a heavy Clausewitzian influence in that era is [[Spenser Wilkinson]], journalist, the first [[Chichele Professor of Military History]] at Oxford University, and perhaps the most prominent military analyst in Britain from c</span>
				<span class='text'>885 until well into the interwar period</span>
				<span class='text'>Another is naval historian [[Julian Corbett]] (1854–1922), whose work reflected a deep if idiosyncratic adherence to Clausewitz's concepts and frequently an emphasis on Clausewitz's ideas about 'limited war' and the inherent strengths of the defensive form of war</span>
				<span class='text'>Corbett's practical strategic views were often in prominent public conflict with Wilkinson's--see, for example, Wilkinson's article &quot;[http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>om/readings/Wilkinson/StrategyAtSea</span>
				<span class='text'>tm Strategy at Sea],&quot; ''The Morning Post'', 12 February 1912</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the First World War, however, the influential British military commentator [[B</span>
				<span class='text'>H</span>
				<span class='text'>Liddell Hart]] in the 1920s erroneously attributed to him the doctrine of &quot;total war&quot; that during the First World War had been embraced by many European general staffs and emulated by the British</span>
				<span class='text'>More recent scholars typically see that war as so confused in terms of political rationale that it in fact contradicts much of ''On War</span>

				<span class='text'>Gray]]; historian [[Hew Strachan]] (like Wilkinson also the [[Chichele Professor of Military History]] at Oxford University, since 2001) has been an energetic proponent of the ''study'' of Clausewitz, but his own views on Clausewitz's ideas are somewhat ambivalent</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Rapoport argued that:&lt;blockquote&gt;As for Lenin's approval of Clausewitz, it probably stems from his obsession with the struggle for power</span>
				<span class='text'>The whole Marxist conception of history is that of successive struggles for power, primarily between social classes</span>
				<span class='text'>This was constantly applied by Lenin in a variety of contexts</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus the entire history of philosophy appears in Lenin's writings as a vast struggle between &quot;idealism&quot; and &quot;materialism&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The fate of the socialist movement was to be decided by a struggle between the revolutionists and the reformers</span>
				<span class='text'>Clausewitz's acceptance of the struggle for power as the essence of international politics must had impressed Lenin as starkly realistic</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Rapoport, Anatol &quot;Introduction&quot; pages 11-82 from ''On War,'' London: Penguin, 1968 pages 37-38</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Clausewitz directly influenced Mao Zedong, who read ''On War'' in 1938 and organized a seminar on Clausewitz for the Party leadership in [[Yan'an]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus the &quot;Clausewitzian&quot; content in many of Mao's writings is not merely a regurgitation of Lenin but reflects Mao's own in-depth study</span>

				<span class='text'>The phrase ''[[fog of war]]'' derives from Clausewitz's stress on how confused warfare can seem while immersed within it</span>

				<span class='text'>==Late 20th and early 21st century===The deterrence strategy of the United States in the 1950s was closely inspired by President [[Dwight Eisenhower]]’s reading of Clausewitz as a young officer in the 1920s</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Eisenhower was greatly impressed by Clausewitz’s example of a theoretical, idealized “absolute war” in ''Vom Krieg'' as a way of demonstrating how absurd it would be to attempt such a strategy in practice</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gaddis 1997, page 233&quot;/&gt; For Eisenhower, the age of nuclear weapons had made what was for Clausewitz in the early 19th century only a theoretical vision an all too real possibility in the mid-20th century</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gaddis 1997, page 233&quot;/&gt; From Eisenhower’s viewpoint, the best deterrent to war was to show the world just how appalling and horrific a nuclear “absolute war” would be if it should ever occur, hence a series of much publicized nuclear tests in the Pacific, giving first priority in the defense budget to nuclear weapons and delivery systems over conventional weapons, and making repeated statements in public that the United States was able and willing at all times to use nuclear weapons</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Gaddis 1997, page 233&quot;/&gt; In this way through the [[Massive retaliation]] doctrine and the closely related foreign policy concept of [[Brinkmanship]], Eisenhower hoped to hold out a creditable vision of Clausewitzian nuclear “absolute war” in order to deter the Soviet Union and/or China from ever risking a war or even conditions that might lead to a war with the United States</span>

				<span class='text'>If Clausewitz had focused solely on wars between countries with well-defined armies, as many commentators have argued, then perhaps ''On War'' has lost its analytical edge as a tool for understanding war as it is currently fought</span>
				<span class='text'>This is an ahistorical view, however, for the era of the French Revolution and Napoleon was full of revolutions, rebellions, and violence by &quot;non-state actors&quot;, such as the wars in the French Vendée and in Spain</span>
				<span class='text'>Clausewitz wrote a series of “Lectures on Small War” and studied the rebellion in the Vendée (1793–1796) and the Tyrolean uprising of 1809</span>
				<span class='text'>In his famous “Bekenntnisdenkschrift” of 1812, he called for a “Spanish war in Germany” and laid out a comprehensive guerrilla strategy to be waged against Napoleon</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''On War'' he included a famous chapter on “The People in Arms</span>
				<span class='text'>One prominent critic of Clausewitz is the Israeli military historian [[Martin van Creveld]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In his book ''The Transformation of War'',&lt;ref&gt;Martin van Creveld, ''The Transformation of War: The Most Radical Reinterpretation of Armed Conflict Since Clausewitz'' (New York: The Free Press, 1991)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Creveld argued that Clausewitz's famous &quot;Trinity&quot; of people, army, and government was an obsolete socio-political construct based on the state, which was rapidly passing from the scene as the key player in war, and that he (Creveld) had constructed a new &quot;non-trinitarian&quot; model for modern warfare</span>
				<span class='text'>Creveld's work has had great influence</span>
				<span class='text'>Daniel Moran replied, 'The most egregious misrepresentation of Clausewitz’s famous metaphor must be that of Martin van Creveld, who has declared Clausewitz to be an apostle of Trinitarian War, by which he means, incomprehensibly, a war of 'state against state and army against army,' from which the influence of the people is entirely excluded</span>

				<span class='text'>Knowing that &quot;war is an expression of politics by other means&quot; does us no good unless we use a definition of &quot;politics&quot; that is appropriate to the circumstance and to the cultural proclivities of the combatants in each situation; this is especially true when warfare is carried on across a cultural or civilizational divide, and the antagonists do not share as much common background as did many of the participants in the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s</span>
