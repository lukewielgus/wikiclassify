				<span class='text'>His argument for anarchy was too powerful, passionate, and cogent to be a joke</span>

				<span class='text'>But even as he wrote, the old order he loved was already breaking down</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;In 1757, Burke published a treatise on aesthetics, ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'', which attracted the attention of prominent Continental thinkers such as [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was his only purely philosophical work, and when asked by [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] and [[French Laurence]] to expand it thirty years later, Burke replied that he was no longer fit for abstract speculation (Burke had written it before he was nineteen years of age)</span>

				<span class='text'>Although the [[Estate (land)|estate]] included saleable assets such as [[art work]]s by [[Titian]], ''Gregories'' proved a heavy financial burden in the following decades and Burke was never able to repay its purchase price in full</span>
				<span class='text'>His speeches and writings having made him famous led to the suggestion that he was the author of the ''[[Letters of Junius]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>n May 1778, Burke supported a [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|parliamentary motion]] revising restrictions on Irish trade</span>
				<span class='text'>His constituents, citizens of the great trading city of Bristol, however urged Burke to oppose [[free trade]] with Ireland</span>
				<span class='text'>Burke resisted their protestations and said: &quot;If, from this conduct, I shall forfeit their suffrages at an ensuing election, it will stand on record an example to future representatives of the Commons of England, that one man at least had dared to resist the desires of his constituents when his judgment assured him they were wrong&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;This support for unpopular causes, notably free trade with Ireland and [[Catholic Emancipation]], led to Burke losing his [[seat]] in 1780</span>
				<span class='text'>For the remainder of his parliamentary career, Burke represented [[Malton (UK Parliament constituency)|Malton]], another pocket borough under the [[Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham|Marquess of Rockingham]]'s patronage</span>
				<span class='text'>=American War of Independence==Burke expressed his support for the grievances of the [[American Colonies]] under the government of [[King George III]] and his appointed representatives</span>
				<span class='text'>On 19 April 1774 Burke made a speech, &quot;[[On American Taxation]]&quot; (published in January 1775), on a [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] to repeal the [[Tea Act|tea duty]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Again and again, revert to your old principles—seek peace and ensue it; leave America, if she has taxable matter in her, to tax herself</span>
				<span class='text'>I am not here going into the distinctions of rights, nor attempting to mark their boundaries</span>
				<span class='text'>I do not enter into these metaphysical distinctions; I hate the very sound of them</span>
				<span class='text'>Leave the Americans as they anciently stood, and these distinctions, born of our unhappy contest, will die along with it</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Be content to bind America by laws of trade; you have always done it</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Do not burthen them with taxes</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> But if intemperately, unwisely, fatally, you sophisticate and poison the very source of government by urging subtle deductions, and consequences odious to those you govern, from the unlimited and illimitable nature of supreme sovereignty, you will teach them by these means to call that sovereignty itself in question</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> If that sovereignty and their freedom cannot be reconciled, which will they take? They will cast your sovereignty in your face</span>
				<span class='text'>No body of men will be argued into slavery</span>
				<span class='text'>Sir, let the gentlemen on the other side</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>tell me, what one character of liberty the Americans have, and what one brand of slavery they are free from, if they are bound in their property and industry by all the restraints you can imagine on commerce, and at the same time are made pack-horses of every tax you choose to impose, without the least share in granting them</span>
				<span class='text'>When they bear the burthens of unlimited monopoly, will you bring them to bear the burthens of unlimited revenue too? The Englishman in America will feel that this is slavery; that it is ''legal'' slavery, will be no compensation either to his feelings or to his understandings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>142–3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;On 22 March 1775, in the House of Commons, Burke delivered a speech (published during May 1775) on reconciliation with [[United States|America]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Burke appealed for peace as preferable to [[civil war]] and reminded the House of America's growing population, its industry, and its wealth</span>
				<span class='text'>He warned against the notion that the Americans would back down in the face of force, since most Americans were of British descent:&lt;blockquote&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>the people of the colonies are descendants of Englishmen</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> They are therefore not only devoted to liberty, but to liberty according to English ideas and on English principles</span>
				<span class='text'>The people are Protestants</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>a persuasion not only favourable to liberty, but built upon it</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> My hold of the colonies is in the close affection which grows from common names, from kindred blood, from similar privileges, and equal protection</span>
				<span class='text'>These are ties which, though light as air, are as strong as links of iron</span>
				<span class='text'>Let the colonies always keep the idea of their civil rights associated with your government—they will cling and grapple to you, and no force under heaven will be of power to tear them from their allegiance</span>
				<span class='text'>But let it be once understood that your government may be one thing and their privileges another, that these two things may exist without any mutual relation—the cement is gone, the cohesion is loosened, and everything hastens to decay and dissolution</span>
				<span class='text'>As long as you have the wisdom to keep the sovereign authority of this country as the sanctuary of liberty, the sacred temple consecrated to our common faith, wherever the chosen race and sons of England worship freedom, they will turn their faces towards you</span>
				<span class='text'>The more they multiply, the more friends you will have; the more ardently they love liberty, the more perfect will be their obedience</span>
				<span class='text'>Slavery they can have anywhere</span>
				<span class='text'>It is a weed that grows in every soil</span>
				<span class='text'>They may have it from Spain, they may have it from Prussia</span>
				<span class='text'>But, until you become lost to all feeling of your true interest and your natural dignity, freedom they can have from none but you</span>

				<span class='text'>Not peace through the medium of war, not peace to be hunted through the labyrinth of intricate and endless negotiations, not peace to arise out of universal discord</span>

				<span class='text'>rg |date= |accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Burke was not merely presenting a [[Peace treaty|peace agreement]] to Parliament; rather, he stepped forward with four reasons against using force, carefully reasoned</span>
				<span class='text'>He laid out his objections in an orderly manner, focusing on one before moving to the next</span>
				<span class='text'>His first concern was that the use of force would have to be temporary, and that the uprisings and objections to British governance in America would not be</span>
				<span class='text'>Second, Burke worried about the uncertainty surrounding whether Britain would win a conflict in America</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;An armament&quot;, Burke said, &quot;is not a victory&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;National Humanities Center&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burke|first1=Edmund|title=Speech to Parliament on Reconciliation with the American Colonies|url=http://americainclass</span>

				<span class='text'>df|website=America in Class|publisher=National Humanities Center|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, Burke brought up the issue of impairment; it would do the British Government no good to engage in a scorched earth war and have the object they desired (America) become damaged or even useless</span>
				<span class='text'>The American colonists could always retreat into the mountains, but the land they left behind would most likely be unusable, whether by accident or design</span>
				<span class='text'>The fourth and final reason to avoid the use of force was experience; the British had never attempted to rein in an unruly colony by force, and they did not know if it could be done, let alone accomplished thousands of miles away from home</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;National Humanities Center&quot;/&gt; Not only were all of these concerns reasonable, but some turned out to be prophetic – the American colonists did not surrender, even when things looked extremely bleak, and the British were ultimately unsuccessful in their attempts to win a war fought on American soil</span>
				<span class='text'>t was not temporary force, uncertainty, impairment, or even experience that Burke cited as the number one reason for avoiding war with the American colonies, however; it was the character of the American people themselves:&lt;blockquote&gt;In this character of Americans, a love of freedom is the predominating feature which marks and distinguishes the whole</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>this fierce spirit of liberty is stronger in the English colonies, probably, than in any other people of the earth</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[the] men [are] acute, inquisitive, dextrous, prompt in attack, ready in defense, full of resources</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;National Humanities Center&quot;/&gt; Burke concludes with another plea for peace, and a prayer that Britain might avoid actions which, in Burke's words, &quot;may bring on the destruction of this Empire&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;National Humanities Center&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Burke proposed six resolutions to settle the American conflict peacefully:# Allow the American colonists to elect their own representatives, thus settling the dispute about taxation without representation;# Acknowledge this wrongdoing and apologise for grievances caused;# Procure an efficient manner of choosing and sending these delegates;# Set up a General Assembly in America itself, with powers to regulate taxes;# Stop gathering taxes by imposition (or law), and start gathering them only when they are needed; and# Grant needed aid to the colonies</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;National Humanities Center&quot;/&gt;The effect of these resolutions, had they been passed, can never be known</span>
				<span class='text'>Unfortunately, Burke delivered this speech just less than a month before the explosive conflict at Concord and Lexington,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lexington and Concord|url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>rg|publisher=Independence Hall Association in Philadelphia|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as these resolutions were not enacted, little was done that would help to dissuade conflict</span>
				<span class='text'>mong the reasons this speech was so greatly admired was its passage on [[Allen Bathurst, 1st Earl Bathurst|Lord Bathurst]] (1684–1775); Burke describes an angel in 1704 prophesying to Bathurst the future greatness of England and also of America: &quot;Young man, There is America – which at this day serves little more than to amuse you with stories of savage men, and uncouth manners; yet shall, before you taste of death, shew itself equal to the whole of that commerce which now attracts the envy of the world&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>=Democracy==In 1774, Burke's ''Speech to the Electors at Bristol at the Conclusion of the Poll'' was noted for its defence of the principles of [[Representation (politics)|representative]] government against the notion that elected officials should merely be delegates:&lt;blockquote&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>it ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the strictest union, the closest correspondence, and the most unreserved communication with his constituents</span>
				<span class='text'>Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention</span>
				<span class='text'>It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own</span>
				<span class='text'>But his unbiased opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living</span>
				<span class='text'>These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution</span>
				<span class='text'>They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable</span>
				<span class='text'>Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion</span>

				<span class='text'>446–8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Political scientist [[Hanna Pitkin]] points out that Burke linked the interest of the district with the proper behaviour of its elected official, explaining, &quot;Burke conceives of broad, relatively fixed interest, few in number and clearly defined, of which any group or locality has just one</span>
				<span class='text'>These interests are largely economic or associated with particular localities whose livelihood they characterize, in his over-all prosperity they involve</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Fenichel Pitkin, ''The concept of representation'' (1972) p</span>
				<span class='text'>174&lt;/ref&gt;Burke was a leading sceptic with respect to democracy</span>
				<span class='text'>While admitting that theoretically, in some cases it might be desirable, he insisted a democratic government in Britain in his day would not only be inept, but also oppressive</span>
				<span class='text'>He opposed democracy for three basic reasons</span>
				<span class='text'>First, government required a degree of intelligence and breadth of knowledge of the sort that occurred rarely among the common people</span>
				<span class='text'>Second, he thought that if they had the vote, common people had dangerous and angry passions that could be aroused easily by demagogues; he feared that the authoritarian impulses that could be empowered by these passions would undermine cherished traditions and established religion, leading to violence and confiscation of property</span>
				<span class='text'>Third, Burke warned that democracy would create a tyranny over [[Tyranny of the majority|unpopular minorities]], who needed the protection of the upper classes</span>

				<span class='text'>His interaction with the British dominion of India began well before Hastings' impeachment trial</span>
				<span class='text'>For two decades prior to the impeachment, Parliament had dealt with the Indian issue</span>
				<span class='text'>This trial was the pinnacle of years of unrest and deliberation</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In 1781 Burke was first able to delve into the issues surrounding the [[East India Company]] when he was appointed Chairman of the Commons Select Committee on East Indian Affairs—from that point until the end of the trial; India was Burke's primary concern</span>
				<span class='text'>This committee was charged &quot;to investigate alleged injustices in Bengal, the war with Hyder Ali, and other Indian difficulties&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Russell Kirk, ''Edmund Burke: A Genius Reconsidered'' (1988), 2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; While Burke and the committee focused their attention on these matters, a second 'secret' committee was formed to assess the same issues</span>
				<span class='text'>Both committee reports were written by Burke</span>
				<span class='text'>Among other purposes, the reports conveyed to the [[Maharaja|Indian princes]] that Britain would not wage war on them, along with demanding that the HEIC recall Hastings</span>
				<span class='text'>This was Burke's first call for substantive change regarding imperial practices</span>
				<span class='text'>When addressing the whole House of Commons regarding the committee report, Burke described the Indian issue as one that &quot;began 'in commerce' but 'ended in empire</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On 28 February 1785, Burke delivered a now-famous speech, ''The [[Nabob of Arcot]]'s Debts'', wherein he condemned the damage to [[India]] by the East India Company</span>
				<span class='text'>In the province of the [[Carnatic region|Carnatic]] the Indians had constructed a system of reservoirs to make the soil fertile in a naturally dry region, and centred their society on the husbandry of water:&lt;blockquote&gt;These are the monuments of real kings, who were the fathers of their people; testators to a posterity which they embraced as their own</span>
				<span class='text'>These are the grand sepulchres built by ambition; but by the ambition of an insatiable benevolence, which, not contented with reigning in the dispensation of happiness during the contracted term of human life, had strained, with all the reachings and graspings of a vivacious mind, to extend the dominion of their bounty beyond the limits of nature, and to perpetuate themselves through generations of generations, the guardians, the protectors, the nourishers of mankind</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McCue, p</span>
				<span class='text'>155</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Burke held that the advent of British dominion, and in particular the conduct of the East India Company, had destroyed much that was good in these traditions and that, as a consequence of this, and the lack of new customs to replace them, the Indians were suffering</span>
				<span class='text'>He set about establishing a set of British expectations, whose moral foundation would, in his opinion, warrant the empire</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;McCue, p</span>
				<span class='text'>156</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On 4 April 1786, Burke presented the Commons with the ''Article of Charge of [[High Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'' against Hastings</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Burke's indictment, fuelled by emotional indignation, branded Hastings a 'captain-general of iniquity'; who never dined without 'creating a famine'; whose heart was 'gangrened to the core', and who resembled both a 'spider of Hell' and a 'ravenous vulture devouring the carcasses of the dead'</span>

				<span class='text'>By the Right Honourable Edmund Burke</span>
				<span class='text'>']]Initially, Burke did not condemn the [[French Revolution]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter of 9 August 1789, Burke wrote: &quot;England gazing with astonishment at a French struggle for Liberty and not knowing whether to blame or to applaud! The thing indeed, though I thought I saw something like it in progress for several years, has still something in it paradoxical and Mysterious</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clark, p</span>
				<span class='text'>61</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The events of 5–6 October 1789, when a crowd of Parisian women marched on Versailles to compel [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] to return to Paris, turned Burke against it</span>
				<span class='text'>In a letter to his son, Richard Burke, dated 10 October he said: &quot;This day I heard from Laurence who has sent me papers confirming the portentous state of France—where the Elements which compose Human Society seem all to be dissolved, and a world of Monsters to be produced in the place of it—where Mirabeau presides as the Grand Anarch; and the late Grand Monarch makes a figure as ridiculous as pitiable&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>61–2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; On 4 November Charles-Jean-François Depont wrote to Burke, requesting that he endorse the Revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>Burke replied that any critical language of it by him should be taken &quot;as no more than the expression of doubt&quot; but he added: &quot;You may have subverted Monarchy, but not recover'd freedom&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clark, p</span>
				<span class='text'>62</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the same month he described [[France]] as &quot;a country undone&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Burke's first public condemnation of the Revolution occurred on the debate in Parliament on the army estimates on 9 February 1790, provoked by praise of the Revolution by Pitt and Fox:&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the House had been prorogued in the summer much work was done in France</span>
				<span class='text'>The French had shewn themselves the ablest architects of ruin that had hitherto existed in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>In that very short space of time they had completely pulled down to the ground, their monarchy; their church; their nobility; their law; their revenue; their army; their navy; their commerce; their arts; and their manufactures</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>there was a danger of] an imitation of the excesses of an irrational, unprincipled, proscribing, confiscating, plundering, ferocious, bloody and tyrannical democracy</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>in religion] the danger of their example is no longer from intolerance, but from Atheism; a foul, unnatural vice, foe to all the dignity and consolation of mankind; which seems in France, for a long time, to have been embodied into a faction, accredited, and almost avowed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>66–7</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In January 1790, Burke read Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Richard Price]]'s sermon of 4 November 1789 entitled, ''A Discourse on the Love of our Country'', to the [[Revolution Society]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>In this sermon Price espoused the philosophy of universal &quot;Rights of Men&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Price argued that love of our country &quot;does not imply any conviction of the superior value of it to other countries, or any particular preference of its laws and constitution of government&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clark, p</span>
				<span class='text'>63</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Price asserted that Englishmen should see themselves &quot;more as citizens of the world than as members of any particular community&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'> debate between Price and Burke ensued that was &quot;the classic moment at which two fundamentally different conceptions of national identity were presented to the English public&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''English Society'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>233</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Price claimed that the principles of the Glorious Revolution included &quot;the right to choose our own governors, to cashier them for misconduct, and to frame a government for ourselves&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>mmediately after reading Price's sermon, Burke wrote a draft of what eventually became, ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;What the Glorious Revolution had meant was as important to Burke and his contemporaries as it had been for the last one hundred years in British politics</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clark, p</span>
				<span class='text'>39</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Reflections'', Burke argued against Price's interpretation of the Glorious Revolution and instead, gave a classic Whig defence of it</span>

				<span class='text'>24–5, p</span>
				<span class='text'>34, p</span>
				<span class='text'>43</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Burke argued against the idea of abstract, metaphysical rights of humans and instead advocated national tradition:&lt;blockquote&gt; The Revolution was made to preserve our ''antient'' indisputable laws and liberties, and that ''antient'' constitution of government which is our only security for law and liberty</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> The very idea of the fabrication of a new government, is enough to fill us with disgust and horror</span>
				<span class='text'>We wished at the period of the Revolution, and do now wish, to derive all we possess as ''an inheritance from our forefathers''</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon that body and stock of inheritance we have taken care not to inoculate any cyon [scion] alien to the nature of the original plant</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Our oldest reformation is that of [[Magna Carta|Magna Charta]]</span>
				<span class='text'>You will see that Sir [[Edward Coke]], that great oracle of our law, and indeed all the great men who follow him, to [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]], are industrious to prove the pedigree of our liberties</span>
				<span class='text'>They endeavour to prove that the ancient charter</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>were nothing more than a re-affirmance of the still more ancient standing law of the kingdom</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> In the famous law</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>called the ''[[Petition of Right]]'', the parliament says to the king, &quot;Your subjects have ''inherited'' this freedom&quot;, claiming their franchises not on abstract principles &quot;as the rights of men&quot;, but as the rights of Englishmen, and as a patrimony derived from their forefathers</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>181–3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Burke put forward that &quot;We fear God, we look up with awe to kings; with affection to parliaments; with duty to magistrates; with reverence to priests; and with respect to nobility</span>
				<span class='text'>Why? Because when such ideas are brought before our minds, it is ''natural'' to be so affected&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>250–1</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Burke defended this prejudice on the grounds that it is &quot;the general bank and capital of nations, and of ages&quot; and superior to individual reason, which is small in comparison</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Prejudice&quot;, Burke claimed, &quot;is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved</span>
				<span class='text'>Prejudice renders a man's virtue his habit&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>251–2</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Burke criticised [[social contract]] theory by claiming that society is indeed, a contract, but &quot;a partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Clark, p</span>
				<span class='text'>261</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The most famous passage in Burke's ''Reflections'' was his description of the events of 5–6 October 1789 and the part of [[Marie-Antoinette]] in them</span>
				<span class='text'>Burke's account differs little from modern historians who have used primary sources</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke</span>
				<span class='text'>Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>II'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>289–90</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His use of flowery language to describe it, however, provoked both praise and criticism</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Philip Francis (politician)|Philip Francis]] wrote to Burke saying that what he wrote of Marie-Antoinette was &quot;pure foppery&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>II'', p</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Burke was informed by an Englishman who had talked with the [[Armand Louis de Gontaut|Duchesse de Biron]], that when Marie-Antoinette was reading the passage, she burst into tears and took considerable time to finish reading it</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Price had rejoiced that the French king had been &quot;led in triumph&quot; during the October Days, but to Burke this symbolised the opposing revolutionary sentiment of the Jacobins and the natural sentiments of those who shared his own view with horror—that the ungallant assault on Marie-Antoinette—was a cowardly attack on a defenceless woman</span>

				<span class='text'>[Burke] said, no, Sir, not more than usual—You have and very well employed too, but there are none so deaf as those that w'ont hear, and none so blind as those that w'ont see—[Burke] made a low bow, Sir, I certainly now understand you, but was afraid my vanity or presumption might have led me to imagine what Your Majesty has said referred to what I have done—You cannot be vain—You have been of ''use to us all'', it is a general opinion, is it not so [[John Dalrymple, 6th Earl of Stair|Lord Stair]]? who was standing near</span>
				<span class='text'>It is said Lord Stair;—Your Majesty's adopting it, Sir, will make the opinion general, said [Burke]—I know it is the general opinion, and I know that there is no Man who calls himself a Gentleman that must not think himself obliged to you, for you have supported the cause of the Gentlemen—You know the tone at Court is a whisper, but The King said all this loud, so as to be heard by every one at Court</span>

				<span class='text'>491</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the [[National Assembly of France]], wrote to Burke, praising ''Reflections'' and requesting more &quot;very refreshing mental food&quot; that he could publish</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Cobban and Smith (eds</span>
				<span class='text'>, ''Correspondence of Edmund Burke</span>
				<span class='text'>Volume VI'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>162–69</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This Burke did in April 1791 when he published ''A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly''</span>
				<span class='text'>Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France</span>
				<span class='text'>Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed &quot;a considerable insight into human nature&quot; he mostly was critical</span>
				<span class='text'>Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of [[David Hume]], with whom Rousseau had stayed</span>
				<span class='text'>Burke said Rousseau &quot;entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but ''vanity''&quot;—which he &quot;was possessed to a degree little short of madness&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He also cited Rousseau's ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'' as evidence that Rousseau had a life of &quot;obscure and vulgar vices&quot; that was not &quot;chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: &quot;a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lock, ''Burke</span>
				<span class='text'>Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>II'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>356–67</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;These events and the disagreements that arose from them within the Whig Party, led to its break-up and to the rupture of Burke's friendship with Fox</span>
				<span class='text'>In debate in Parliament on Britain's relations with Russia, Fox praised the principles of the revolution, although Burke was not able to reply at this time as he was &quot;overpowered by continued cries of question from his own side of the House&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Prior, p</span>
				<span class='text'>327</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; When Parliament was debating the Quebec Bill for a constitution for Canada, Fox praised the revolution and criticised some of Burke's arguments, such as hereditary power</span>
				<span class='text'>On 6 May 1791, during another debate in Parliament on the Quebec Bill, Burke used the opportunity to answer Fox, and to condemn the new French Constitution and &quot;the horrible consequences flowing from the French idea of the Rights of Man&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;McCue, p</span>
				<span class='text'>23&quot;&gt;McCue, p</span>
				<span class='text'>23</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Burke asserted that those ideas were the antithesis of both the British and the American constitutions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Frank O'Gorman, ''The Whig Party and the French Revolution'' (Macmillan, 1967), p</span>
				<span class='text'>65</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Burke was interrupted, and Fox intervened, saying that Burke should be allowed to carry on with his speech</span>
				<span class='text'>A vote of censure was moved against Burke, however, for noticing the affairs of France, which was moved by [[John Baker-Holroyd, 1st Earl of Sheffield|Lord Sheffield]] and seconded by Fox</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Prior, p</span>
				<span class='text'>328</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Pitt made a speech praising Burke, and Fox made a speech—both rebuking and complimenting Burke</span>
				<span class='text'>He questioned the sincerity of Burke, who seemed to have forgotten the lessons he had learned from him, quoting from Burke's own speeches of fourteen and fifteen years before</span>
				<span class='text'>urke's response was:[[File:Charles James Fox00</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|[[Charles James Fox]]]]&lt;blockquote&gt;It certainly was indiscreet at any period, but especially at his time of life, to parade enemies, or give his friends occasion to desert him; yet if his firm and steady adherence to the British constitution placed him in such a dilemma, he would risk all, and, as public duty and public experience taught him, with his last words exclaim, &quot;Fly from the French Constitution&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;McCue, p</span>
				<span class='text'>23&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;At this point, Fox whispered that there was &quot;no loss of friendship&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I regret to say there is&quot;, Burke replied, &quot;I have indeed made a great sacrifice; I have done my duty though I have lost my friend</span>
				<span class='text'>There is something in the detested French constitution that envenoms every thing it touches&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Prior, p</span>
				<span class='text'>329&quot;&gt;Prior, p</span>
				<span class='text'>329</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; This provoked a reply from Fox, yet he was unable to give his speech for some time since he was overcome with tears and emotion, he appealed to Burke to remember their inalienable friendship, but also repeated his criticisms of Burke and uttered &quot;unusually bitter sarcasms&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Prior, p</span>
				<span class='text'>329&quot; /&gt; This only aggravated the rupture between the two men</span>
				<span class='text'>Burke demonstrated his separation from the party on 5 June 1791 by writing to Fitzwilliam, declining money from him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;O'Gorman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>75&quot;&gt;O'Gorman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>75</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Burke was dismayed that some Whigs, instead of reaffirming the principles of the Whig Party he laid out in the ''Reflections'', had rejected them in favour of &quot;French principles&quot; and that they criticised Burke for abandoning Whig principles</span>
				<span class='text'>Burke wanted to demonstrate his fidelity to Whig principles and feared that acquiescence to Fox and his followers would allow the Whig Party to become a vehicle for Jacobinism</span>
				<span class='text'>urke knew that many members of the Whig Party did not share Fox's views and he wanted to provoke them into condemning the French Revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>Burke wrote that he wanted to represent the whole Whig party &quot;as tolerating, and by a toleration, countenancing those proceedings&quot; so that he could &quot;stimulate them to a public declaration of what every one of their acquaintance privately knows to be</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>heir sentiments&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;O'Gorman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>74</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, on 3 August 1791 Burke published his ''Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs'', in which he renewed his criticism of the radical revolutionary programmes inspired by the French Revolution and attacked the Whigs who supported them, as holding principles contrary to those traditionally held by the Whig party</span>
				<span class='text'>urke owned two copies of what has been called &quot;that practical compendium of Whig political theory&quot;, ''The Tryal of [[Doctor (title)|Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>] [[Henry Sacheverell]]'' (1710)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Clark, p</span>
				<span class='text'>40&quot;&gt;Clark, p</span>
				<span class='text'>40</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Burke wrote of the trial: &quot;It rarely happens to a party to have the opportunity of a clear, authentic, recorded, declaration of their political tenets upon the subject of a great constitutional event like that of the [Glorious] Revolution&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Clark, p</span>
				<span class='text'>40&quot; /&gt; Writing in the third person, Burke asserted in his ''Appeal'':&lt;blockquote&gt;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>that the foundations laid down by the Commons, on the trial of Doctor Sacheverel, for justifying the revolution of 1688, are the very same laid down in Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Burke's Reflections; that is to say,—a breach of the ''original contract'', implied and expressed in the constitution of this country, as a scheme of government fundamentally and inviolably fixed in King, Lords and Commons</span>
				<span class='text'>That the fundamental subversion of this antient constitution, by one of its parts, having been attempted, and in effect accomplished, justified the Revolution</span>
				<span class='text'>That it was justified ''only'' upon the ''necessity'' of the case; as the ''only'' means left for the recovery of that ''antient'' constitution, formed by the ''original contract'' of the British state; as well as for the future preservation of the ''same'' government</span>
				<span class='text'>These are the points to be proved</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Clark, p</span>
				<span class='text'>40&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Burke then provided quotations from Paine's ''Rights of Man'' to demonstrate what the New Whigs believed</span>
				<span class='text'>Burke's belief that Foxite principles corresponded to Paine's was genuine</span>

				<span class='text'>Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>II'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>383</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Burke denied that a majority of &quot;the people&quot; had, or ought to have, the final say in politics and alter society at their pleasure</span>
				<span class='text'>People had rights, but also duties, and these duties were not voluntary</span>
				<span class='text'>Also, the people could not overthrow morality derived from God</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Although Whig [[grandee]]s such as Portland and Fitzwilliam privately agreed with Burke's ''Appeal'', they wished he had used more moderate language</span>

				<span class='text'>They agree with me to a title; but they dare not speak out for fear of hurting Fox</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;O'Gorman, p</span>
				<span class='text'>75&quot; /&gt; [[Charles Burney]] viewed it as &quot;a most admirable book—the best &amp; most useful on political subjects that I have ever seen&quot; but believed the differences in the Whig Party between Burke and Fox should not be aired publicly</span>

				<span class='text'>Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>II'', pp</span>
				<span class='text'>385–6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Eventually, most of the Whigs sided with Burke and gave their support to Pitt's &quot;conservative&quot; government, which, in response to France's declaration of war against Britain, declared war on France's Revolutionary Government in 1793</span>
				<span class='text'>n December 1791, Burke sent Government ministers his ''Thoughts on French Affairs'' where he put forward three main points: no counter-revolution in France would come about by purely domestic causes; the longer the Revolutionary Government exists the stronger it becomes; and the Revolutionary Government's interest and aim is to disturb all of the other governments of Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>357–8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Burke, as a Whig, did not wish to see an [[absolute monarchy]] again in France after the extirpation of Jacobinism</span>
				<span class='text'>Writing to an ''émigré'' in 1791, Burke expressed his views against a restoration of the ''ancien régime'':&lt;blockquote&gt;When such a complete convulsion has shaken the State, and hardly left any thing whatsoever, either in civil arrangements, or in the Characters and disposition of men's minds, exactly where it was, whatever shall be settled although in the former persons and upon old forms, will be in some measure a new thing and will labour under something of the weakness as well as other inconveniences of a Change</span>
				<span class='text'>My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion</span>
				<span class='text'>That was tho' not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present</span>
				<span class='text'>If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they stood, before the series of experimental politicks began, I am quite sure that they could not long continue in that situation</span>
				<span class='text'>In one Sense of L'Ancien Régime I am clear that nothing else can reasonably be done</span>

				<span class='text'>479–80</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Burke delivered a speech on the debate of the [[Aliens Act 1793|Aliens Bill]] on 28 December 1792</span>
				<span class='text'>He supported the Bill as it would exclude &quot;murderous atheists, who would pull down Church and state; religion and God; morality and happiness&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Burke revealed a dagger he had concealed in his coat and threw it to the floor: &quot;This is what you are to gain by an alliance with France&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Burke picked up the dagger and continued:&lt;blockquote&gt;When they smile, I see blood trickling down their faces; I see their insidious purposes; I see that the object of all their cajoling is—blood! I now warn my countrymen to beware of these execrable philosophers, whose only object it is to destroy every thing that is good here, and to establish immorality and murder by precept and example—'Hic niger est hunc tu Romane caveto' ['Such a man is evil; beware of him, Roman'</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Burke also supported the [[War in the Vendée|royalist uprising]] in [[Vendée|La Vendée]], describing it on 4 November 1793 in a letter to [[William Windham]], as &quot;the sole affair I have much heart in&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Dundas did not follow Burke's advice, however</span>
				<span class='text'>urke believed the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] was not taking the uprising seriously enough, a view reinforced by a letter he had received from the [[Charles X of France|Prince Charles of France]] (''S</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>le comte d'Artois''), dated 23 October, requesting that he intercede on behalf of the royalists to the Government</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;O'Gorman, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>168–69</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Burke published his ''Remarks on the Policy of the Allies with Respect to France'', begun in October, where he said: &quot;I am sure every thing has shewn us that in this war with France, one Frenchman is worth twenty foreigners</span>

				<span class='text'>Rivington, 1815), p</span>
				<span class='text'>141</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;On 20 June 1794, Burke received a vote of thanks from the Commons for his services in the Hastings Trial and he immediately resigned his seat, being replaced by his son [[Richard Burke Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>Richard]]</span>
				<span class='text'>A tragic blow fell upon Burke with the loss of Richard in August 1794, to whom he was tenderly attached, and in whom he saw signs of promise,&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt; which were not patent to others and which, in fact, appear to have been non-existent (though this view may have rather reflected the fact that Richard Burke had worked successfully in the early battle for [[Catholic emancipation]])</span>
				<span class='text'>King George III, whose favour he had gained by his attitude on the French Revolution, wished to create him [[Earl of Beaconsfield]], but the death of his son deprived the opportunity of such an honour and all its attractions, so the only award he would accept was a pension of £2,500</span>
				<span class='text'>Even this modest reward was attacked by the [[John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]] and the [[James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale|Earl of Lauderdale]], to whom Burke replied in his ''Letter to a Noble Lord'' (1796):&lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>425–6</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; &quot;It cannot at this time be too often repeated; line upon line; precept upon precept; until it comes into the currency of a proverb, ''To innovate is not to reform''&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Rivington, 1796), p</span>
				<span class='text'>20</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He argued that he was rewarded on merit, but the Duke of Bedford received his rewards from inheritance alone, his ancestor being the original pensioner: &quot;Mine was from a mild and benevolent sovereign; his from Henry the Eighth&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Burke, ''A Letter to a Noble Lord'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>41</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Burke also hinted at what would happen to such people if their revolutionary ideas were implemented, and included a description of the British constitution:&lt;blockquote&gt;But as to ''our'' country and ''our'' race, as long as the well compacted structure of our church and state, the sanctuary, the holy of holies of that ancient law, defended by reverence, defended by power, a fortress at once and a temple, shall stand inviolate on the brow of the British Sion—as long as the British Monarchy, not more limited than fenced by the orders of the State, shall, like the proud Keep of Windsor, rising in the majesty of proportion, and girt with the double belt of its kindred and coeval towers, as long as this awful structure shall oversee and guard the subjected land—so long as the mounds and dykes of the low, fat, Bedford level will have nothing to fear from all the pickaxes of all the levellers of France</span>

				<span class='text'>52–53</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Burke's last publications were the ''[[Letters on a Regicide Peace]]'' (October 1796), called forth by negotiations for peace with France by the Pitt government</span>
				<span class='text'>Burke regarded this as [[appeasement]], injurious to national dignity and honour</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>439–40</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Second Letter'', Burke wrote of the French Revolutionary Government: &quot;Individuality is left out of their scheme of government</span>
				<span class='text'>The State is all in all</span>
				<span class='text'>Everything is referred to the production of force; afterwards, everything is trusted to the use of it</span>
				<span class='text'>It is military in its principle, in its maxims, in its spirit, and in all its movements</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Burke regarded the war with France as ideological, against an &quot;armed doctrine&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He wished that France would not be partitioned due to the effect this would have on the balance of power in Europe, and that the war was not against France, but against the revolutionaries governing her</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Prior, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>443–4</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Burke said: &quot;It is not France extending a foreign empire over other nations: it is a sect aiming at universal empire, and beginning with the conquest of France&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot; /&gt;==Later life==In November 1795, there was a debate in Parliament on the high price of corn and Burke wrote a memorandum to Pitt on the subject</span>
				<span class='text'>In December [[Samuel Whitbread (1764–1815)|Samuel Whitbread]] MP introduced a bill giving magistrates the power to fix minimum wages and Fox said he would vote for it</span>
				<span class='text'>This debate probably led Burke to editing his memorandum, as there appeared a notice that Burke would soon publish a letter on the subject to the Secretary of the Board of Agriculture ([[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]]), but he failed to complete it</span>

				<span class='text'>419</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Burke criticised policies such as maximum prices and state regulation of wages, and set out what the limits of government should be:&lt;blockquote&gt;That the State ought to confine itself to what regards the State, or the creatures of the State, namely, the exterior establishment of its religion; its magistracy; its revenue; its military force by sea and land; the corporations that owe their existence to its fiat; in a word, to every thing that is ''truly and properly'' public, to the public peace, to the public safety, to the public order, to the public prosperity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Eccleshall, p</span>
				<span class='text'>77</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The economist [[Adam Smith]] remarked that Burke was &quot;the only man I ever knew who thinks on economic subjects exactly as I do, without any previous communications having passed between us&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>In some Cases they act separately, in some they act in conjunction: But of this I am sure; that the first is the worst by far, and the hardest to deal with; and for this amongst other reasons, that it weakens discredits, and ruins that force, which ought to be employed with the greatest Credit and Energy against the other; and that it furnishes Jacobinism with its strongest arms against all ''formal'' Government&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>Because of his conviction that people desire to be ruled and controlled, the division of property formed the basis for social structure, helping develop control within a property-based hierarchy</span>
				<span class='text'>He viewed the social changes brought on by property as the natural order of events, which should be taking place as the human race progressed</span>
				<span class='text'>With the division of property and the class system, he also believed that it kept the monarch in check to the needs of the classes beneath the monarch</span>
				<span class='text'>Since property largely aligned or defined divisions of social class, class too, was seen as natural—part of a social agreement that the setting of persons into different classes, is the mutual benefit of all subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>Concern for property is not Burke's only influence</span>
				<span class='text'>As [[Christopher Hitchens]] summarises, &quot;If modern conservatism can be held to derive from Burke, it is not just because he appealed to property owners in behalf of stability but also because he appealed to an everyday interest in the preservation of the ancestral and the immemorial</span>

				<span class='text'>In politics he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' was controversial at the time of its publication, but after his death, it was to become his best known and most influential work, and a [[manifesto]] for Conservative thinking</span>
				<span class='text'>wo contrasting assessments of Burke also were offered long after his death by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Winston Churchill]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[Das Kapital]]'', Marx wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The sycophant—who in the pay of the English oligarchy played the romantic ''laudator temporis acti'' against the French Revolution just as, in the pay of the North American colonies at the beginning of the American troubles, he had played the liberal against the English oligarchy—was an out-and-out vulgar [[bourgeois]]</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;The laws of commerce are the laws of Nature, and therefore the laws of God</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (E</span>
				<span class='text'>Burke, l</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> pp</span>
				<span class='text'>31, 32) No wonder that, true to the laws of God and Nature, he always sold himself in the best market</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;Winston Churchill, in &quot;Consistency in Politics&quot;, wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;On the one hand [Burke] is revealed as a foremost apostle of Liberty, on the other as the redoubtable champion of Authority</span>
				<span class='text'>But a charge of political inconsistency applied to this life appears a mean and petty thing</span>
				<span class='text'>History easily discerns the reasons and forces which actuated him, and the immense changes in the problems he was facing which evoked from the same profound mind and sincere spirit these entirely contrary manifestations</span>
				<span class='text'>His soul revolted against tyranny, whether it appeared in the aspect of a domineering Monarch and a corrupt Court and Parliamentary system, or whether, mouthing the watch-words of a non-existent liberty, it towered up against him in the dictation of a brutal mob and wicked sect</span>
				<span class='text'>No one can read the Burke of Liberty and the Burke of Authority without feeling that here was the same man pursuing the same ends, seeking the same ideals of society and Government, and defending them from assaults, now from one extreme, now from the other</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;The historian [[Piers Brendon]] asserts that Burke laid the moral foundations for the [[British Empire]], epitomised in the trial of [[Warren Hastings]], that was ultimately to be its undoing: when Burke stated that &quot;The British Empire must be governed on a plan of freedom, for it will be governed by no other&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;K</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>n ideological bacillus that would prove fatal</span>
				<span class='text'>This was Edmund Burke's paternalistic doctrine that colonial government was a trust</span>

				<span class='text'>xviii</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of this opinion, Burke objected to the opium trade, which he called a &quot;smuggling adventure&quot; and condemned &quot;the great Disgrace of the British character in India&quot;</span>
