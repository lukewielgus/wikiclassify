				<span class='text'>He is widely considered one of the most important and influential [[20th-century classical music|composers of the 20th century]]</span>
				<span class='text'>travinsky's compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity</span>
				<span class='text'>He first achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the [[impresario]] [[Sergei Diaghilev]] and first performed in Paris by Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]]: ''[[The Firebird]]'' (1910), ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911) and ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913)</span>
				<span class='text'>The last of these transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure and was largely responsible for Stravinsky's enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design</span>
				<span class='text'>His &quot;Russian phase&quot; was followed in the 1920s by a period in which he turned to [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassical music]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms ([[concerto grosso]], [[fugue]] and [[symphony]]), drawing on earlier styles, especially from the 18th century</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1950s, Stravinsky adopted [[serialism|serial]] procedures</span>
				<span class='text'>His compositions of this period shared traits with examples of his earlier output: rhythmic energy, the construction of extended melodic ideas out of a few two- or three-note [[Cell (music)|cells]] and clarity of [[Musical form|form]], and of [[instrumentation]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to Igor Stravinsky,  the name &quot;Stravinsky&quot; originated from &quot;Strava&quot;, a small river in eastern Poland, tributary to the [[Vistula]]</span>

				<span class='text'>17&lt;/ref&gt; His family was originally called Soulima-Stravinsky, and they were landowners in eastern Poland as far back as can be traced</span>
				<span class='text'>After Russia annexed this part of Poland, the Soulima was dropped, and during the reign of [[Catherine the Great]] the family moved to Russia</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Stravinsky began piano lessons as a young boy, studying music theory and attempting composition</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1890, he saw a performance of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' at the Mariinsky Theatre</span>
				<span class='text'>By age fifteen, he had mastered [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s [[Piano Concerto No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 (Mendelssohn)|Piano Concerto in G minor]] and finished a piano reduction of a [[string quartet]] by [[Alexander Glazunov|Glazunov]], who reportedly considered Stravinsky unmusical, and thought little of his skills</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;564</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Despite his enthusiasm for music, his parents expected him to study law</span>
				<span class='text'>Stravinsky enrolled at the [[University of Saint Petersburg]] in 1901, but he attended fewer than fifty class sessions during his four years of study</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;565</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1902 Stravinsky stayed with composer [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] and his family in the German city of [[Heidelberg]], where Rimsky-Korsakov, arguably the leading Russian composer at that time, suggested to Stravinsky that he should not enter the Saint Petersburg Conservatoire, but instead study composing by taking private lessons, in large part because of his age</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;White 1979, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;8</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Stravinsky's father died of cancer that year, by which time his son had already begun spending more time on his musical studies than on law</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=palmer&gt;Palmer 1982</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;83</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Stravinsky was prevented from taking his final law examinations and later received a half-course diploma in April 1906</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Walsh 2001&quot; /&gt; Thereafter, he concentrated on studying music</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1905, he began to take twice-weekly private lessons from Rimsky-Korsakov, whom he came to regard as a second father</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Dubal 2001, 565&quot; /&gt; These lessons continued until Rimsky-Korsakov's death in 1908</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]]'s opposition to marriage between first cousins, the couple married on 23 January 1906: their first two children, Fyodor (Theodore) and Ludmila, were born in 1907 and 1908, respectively</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;140</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; His family joined him before the end of the ballet season and they decided to remain in the West for a time, as his wife was expecting their third child</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;145&lt;/ref&gt; they moved to Switzerland in early September</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;White 1979, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;33</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Stravinsky composed two further works for the Ballets Russes: ''Petrushka'' (1911), and ''[[Le Sacre du printemps]]'' (''The Rite of Spring''; 1913)</span>
				<span class='text'>hortly following the premiere of ''The Rite of Spring'', Stravinsky contracted typhoid from eating bad oysters, and was confined to a Paris nursing home, unable to depart for Ustilug until 11 July</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;100, 102</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;During the remainder of the summer, Stravinsky turned his attention to completing his first opera, ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|The Nightingale]]'' (usually known by its French title ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|Le Rossignol]]''), which he had begun in 1908 (that is, ''before'' his association with the Ballets Russes)</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;233</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  By then, the Moscow Free Theatre had gone bankrupt</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Walsh 2000, p&amp;nbsp;233</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, ''Le Rossignol'' was first performed under Diaghilev's auspices at the Paris Opéra on 26 May 1914, with sets and costumes designed by [[Alexandre Benois]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Walsh 2000, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;230</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;  ''Le Rossignol'' enjoyed only lukewarm success with the public and the critics, apparently because its delicacy did not meet their expectations of the composer of ''The Rite of Spring</span>
				<span class='text'>'&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;  However, composers including [[Ravel|Maurice Ravel]], [[Bartók|Béla Bartók]], and [[Reynaldo Hahn]] found much to admire in the score's craftsmanship, even alleging to detect the influence of [[Schoenberg|Arnold Schoenberg]]</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;120</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;85</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=palmer /&gt; He approached the Swiss philanthropist [[Werner Reinhart]] for financial assistance during the time he was writing ''[[Histoire du soldat]]'' (''The Soldier's Tale'')</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;47–48</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;456</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Reinhart supported Stravinsky further when he funded a series of concerts of his chamber music in 1919: included was a suite from ''Histoire du soldat'' arranged for violin, piano and clarinet,&lt;ref&gt;Stravinsky 1962, p</span>

				<span class='text'>The texts and literary sources for his work began with a period of interest in [[Folklore|Russian folklore]], which progressed to classical authors and the [[Roman Rite|Latin liturgy]] and moved on to contemporary France ([[André Gide]], in ''Persephone'') and eventually English literature, including Auden, [[T</span>

				<span class='text'>He also had an inexhaustible desire to explore and learn about art, which manifested itself in several of his Paris collaborations</span>
				<span class='text'>Not only was he the principal composer for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, but he also collaborated with Picasso (''Pulcinella'', 1920), [[Jean Cocteau]] ({{lang|la|''Oedipus Rex''}}, 1927), and [[George Balanchine]] ({{lang|fr|''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollon musagète]]''}}, 1928)</span>

				<span class='text'>As a child, he was brought up by his parents in the Russian Orthodox Church</span>
				<span class='text'>Baptized at birth, he later rebelled against the Church and abandoned it by the time he was fourteen or fifteen years old</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the rise of his career he was estranged from Christianity and it was not until he reached his early forties that he experienced a spiritual crisis</span>
				<span class='text'>After befriending a Russian Orthodox priest, Father Nicholas, after his move to [[Nice]] in 1924, he reconnected with his faith</span>
				<span class='text'>He rejoined the Russian Orthodox Church and afterwards remained a committed Christian</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stravinsky and Craft 1960, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;51</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Craft]] noted that Stravinsky prayed daily, before and after composing, and also prayed when facing difficulty</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stravinsky and Craft 1966, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;172–75&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of his life, he was no longer able to attend church services</span>
				<span class='text'>In his late seventies, Stravinsky said:&lt;blockquote&gt;I cannot now evaluate the events that, at the end of those thirty years, made me discover the necessity of religious belief</span>
				<span class='text'>I was not reasoned into my disposition</span>
				<span class='text'>Though I admire the structured thought of theology (Anselm's proof in the ''Fides Quaerens Intellectum'', for instance) it is to religion no more than counterpoint exercises are to music</span>
				<span class='text'>I do not believe in bridges of reason or, indeed, in any form of extrapolation in religious matters</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I can say, however, that for some years before my actual &quot;conversion&quot;, a mood of acceptance had been cultivated in me by a reading of the Gospels and by other religious literature</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; then he may have rated the [[The Rite of Spring#Premiere|1913 premiere of ''The Rite of Spring'']] as a success: it is a famous [[classical music riot]] and Stravinsky referred to it on several occasions in his autobiography as a ''{{Lang|fr|scandale}}''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Stravinsky 1936 {{Page needed|date=October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were reports of fistfights in the audience and the need for a police presence during the second act</span>

				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;10–16, for an overview of contradictory reportage of the event by participants and the press</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Stravinsky was named by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] as one of the 100 most influential people of the century</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Glass&quot;&gt;Glass 1998</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--He became a [[naturalized]] French citizen in 1934 and a naturalized United States citizen in 1945</span>
				<span class='text'>-&gt; In addition to the recognition he received for his compositions, he achieved fame as a pianist and a conductor, often at the premieres of his works</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1923, [[Erik Satie]] wrote an article about Igor Stravinsky in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Satie 1923</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Satie had met Stravinsky for the first time in 1910</span>
				<span class='text'>In the published article, Satie argued that measuring the 'greatness' of an artist by comparing him to other artists, as if speaking about some 'truth', is illusory and that every piece of music should be judged on its own merits and not by comparing it to the standards of other composers</span>
				<span class='text'>That was exactly what [[Jean Cocteau]] did when he commented deprecatingly on Stravinsky in his 1918 book, {{lang|fr|''Le Coq et l'Arlequin''}}</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Volta 1989, first pages of chapter on contemporaries</span>
				<span class='text'>{{Page needed|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;According to ''[[The Musical Times]]'' in 1923:&lt;blockquote&gt;All the signs indicate a strong reaction against the nightmare of noise and eccentricity that was one of the legacies of the war</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> What has become of the works that made up the program of the Stravinsky concert which created such a stir a few years ago? Practically the whole lot are already on the shelf, and they will remain there until a few jaded neurotics once more feel a desire to eat ashes and fill their belly with the east wind</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Times'', October 1923</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 1935, the American composer [[Marc Blitzstein]] compared Stravinsky to [[Jacopo Peri]] and [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Bach]], conceding that, &quot;there is no denying the greatness of Stravinsky</span>
				<span class='text'>It is just that he is not great enough&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blitzstein 1935, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;330</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Blitzstein's [[Marxism|Marxist]] position was that Stravinsky's wish to &quot;divorce music from other streams of life&quot;, which is &quot;symptomatic of an escape from reality&quot;, resulted in a &quot;loss of stamina&quot;, naming specifically ''Apollo'', the ''Capriccio'', and ''Le Baiser de la fée''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Blitzstein 1935, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;346–47</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;The composer [[Constant Lambert]] described pieces such as {{lang|fr|''Histoire du soldat''}} as containing &quot;essentially cold-blooded abstraction&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lambert 1936, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;94</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Lambert continued, &quot;melodic fragments in {{lang|fr|''Histoire du Soldat''}} are completely meaningless themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>They are merely successions of notes that can conveniently be divided into groups of three, five, and seven and set against other mathematical groups&quot; and he described the cadenza for solo drums as &quot;musical purity</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>chieved by a species of musical castration&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He compared Stravinsky's choice of &quot;the drabbest and least significant phrases&quot; to [[Gertrude Stein]]'s: &quot;Everyday they were gay there, they were regularly gay there everyday&quot; (&quot;Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene&quot;, 1922), &quot;whose effect would be equally appreciated by someone with no knowledge of English whatsoever&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Lambert 1936, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;mbdp;101–05</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;In his 1949 book ''Philosophy of Modern Music'', [[Theodor W</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno]] described Stravinsky as an acrobat and spoke of [[Disorganized schizophrenia|hebephrenic]] and psychotic traits in several of Stravinsky's works</span>
				<span class='text'>Contrary to a common misconception, Adorno didn't believe the hebephrenic and psychotic imitations that the music was supposed to contain were its main fault, as he pointed out in a postscript that he added later to his book</span>
				<span class='text'>Adorno's criticism of Stravinsky is more concerned with the &quot;transition to positivity&quot; Adorno found in his neoclassical works</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Adorno 2006, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;167</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Part of the composer's error, in Adorno's view, was his neo-classicism,&lt;ref&gt;Adorno 1973, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;206–209</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; but of greater importance was his music's &quot;pseudomorphism of painting&quot;, playing off {{lang|fr|''le temps espace''}} (time-space) rather than {{lang|fr|''le temps durée''}} (time-duration) of [[Henri Bergson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Adorno 1973, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;191–93</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to Adorno, &quot;one trick characterizes all of Stravinsky's formal endeavors: the effort of his music to portray time as in a circus tableau and to present time complexes as though they were spatial</span>
				<span class='text'>This trick, however, soon exhausts itself&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Adorno 1973, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;195</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Adorno maintained that the &quot;rhythmic procedures closely resemble the schema of catatonic conditions</span>
				<span class='text'>In certain schizophrenics, the process by which the motor apparatus becomes independent leads to infinite repetition of gestures or words, following the decay of the ego&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Adorno 1973, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;178</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Stravinsky's reputation in Russia and the USSR rose and fell</span>
				<span class='text'>Performances of his music were banned from around 1933 until 1962, the year [[Nikita Khrushchev]] invited him to the USSR for an official state visit</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1972, an official proclamation by the Soviet Minister of Culture, [[Ekaterina Furtseva]], ordered Soviet musicians to &quot;study and admire&quot; Stravinsky's music and she made hostility toward it a potential offence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Karlinsky 1985, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;282</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--During his lifetime, Stravinsky was often criticized for the apparently abrupt changes in style from one work to another</span>
				<span class='text'>But, by the 1980s, scholars and critics had &quot;gradually begun to perceive unifying elements</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;--&gt;While Stravinsky's music has been criticized for its range of styles, scholars had &quot;gradually begun to perceive unifying elements in Stravinsky's music&quot; by the 1980s</span>
				<span class='text'>Earlier writers, such as Aaron Copland, Elliott Carter, Boris de Schloezer, and Virgil Thomson, writing in ''Modern Music'' (a quarterly review published between 1925 and 1946), could find only a common &quot;'seriousness' of 'tone' or of 'purpose', 'the exact correlation between the goal and the means', or a dry 'ant-like neatness'&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>In his 1936 autobiography, ''Chronicle of My Life'', which was written with the help of [[Walter Nouvel]], Stravinsky included his well-known statement that &quot;music is, by its very nature, essentially powerless to express anything at all&quot;</span>
