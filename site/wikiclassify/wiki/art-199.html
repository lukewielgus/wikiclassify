				<span class='text'> Recently, philosophers and scholars have begun to appreciate Fichte as an important philosopher in his own right due to his original insights into the nature of [[self-consciousness]] or [[self-awareness]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Fichte was also the originator of [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis‚Äìantithesis‚Äìsynthesis]], an idea that is often erroneously attributed to [[Hegel]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Fichte also wrote works of [[political philosophy]]; he has a reputation as one of the fathers of [[German nationalism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Biography=====Origins===Fichte was born in [[Rammenau]], [[Upper Lusatia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The son of a ribbon weaver,&lt;ref name=&quot;nie&quot;&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Fichte, Johann Gottlieb|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; he came of peasant stock which had lived in the region for many generations</span>
				<span class='text'>The family was noted in the neighborhood for its probity and piety</span>
				<span class='text'>Christian Fichte, Johann Gottlieb's father, married somewhat above his station</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been suggested that a certain impatience which Fichte himself displayed throughout his life was an inheritance from his mother</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;americana&quot;/&gt;Young Fichte received the rudiments of his education from his father</span>
				<span class='text'>He early showed remarkable ability, and it was owing to his reputation among the villagers that he gained the opportunity for a better education than he otherwise would have received</span>
				<span class='text'>The story runs that the Freiherr von Militz, a country landowner, arrived too late to hear the local pastor preach</span>
				<span class='text'>He was, however, informed that a lad in the neighborhood would be able to repeat the sermon practically verbatim</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result the baron took the lad into his protection, which meant that he paid his tuition</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;americana&quot;&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Fichte, Johann Gottlieb|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;===Early schooling===Fichte was placed in the family of Pastor Krebel at [[Niederau]] near [[Meissen]] and there received thorough grounding in the [[classics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>From this time onward, Fichte saw little of his parents</span>
				<span class='text'>In October 1774, he was attending the celebrated foundation-school at [[Pforta]] near [[Naumburg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This school is associated with the names of [[Novalis]], [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]], [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] and [[Nietzsche]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The spirit of the institution was semi-monastic and, while the education given was excellent in its way, it is doubtful whether there was enough social life and contact with the world for a pupil of Fichte's temperament and antecedents</span>
				<span class='text'>Perhaps his education strengthened a tendency toward introspection and independence, characteristics which appear strongly in his doctrines and writings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;americana&quot;/&gt;===Theological studies===In 1780, he began study at the [[Jena]] theology seminary</span>
				<span class='text'>Fichte seems to have supported himself at this period of bitter poverty and hard struggle</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;americana&quot;/&gt; Freiherr von Militz continued to support him, but when he died in 1784, Fichte had to end his studies prematurely, without completing his degree</span>
				<span class='text'>During the years 1784 to 1788, he supported himself in a precarious way as tutor in various Saxon families</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;nie&quot;/&gt; Fichte then worked as a private tutor in Z√ºrich for two years, which was a time of great contentment for him</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he met Johanna Rahn,&lt;ref name=&quot;americana&quot;/&gt; [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]] and became a member of the freemasonry lodge &quot;Modestia cum Libertate&quot;  where also [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] used to communicate</span>

				<span class='text'>204, ISBN 90-5183-236-2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1790, he became engaged to Johanna Rahn, who happened to be the niece of the famous poet [[F</span>
				<span class='text'>G</span>
				<span class='text'>Klopstock]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1790 Fichte began to study the works of Kant, but this occurred initially because one of his students wanted to know about them</span>
				<span class='text'>They had a lasting effect on the trajectory of his life and thought</span>
				<span class='text'>While he was assimilating the Kantian philosophy and preparing to develop it, fate dealt him a blow:  the Rahn family had suffered financial reverses, and his impending marriage had to be postponed</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;americana&quot;/&gt;===Kant===From Zurich, Fichte returned to [[Leipzig]], and in 1791 obtained a tutorship at [[Warsaw]] in the house of a [[Polish people|Polish]] nobleman</span>
				<span class='text'>The situation, however, quickly proved disagreeable and he was released</span>
				<span class='text'>He then got a chance to see Kant at [[K√∂nigsberg]]</span>
				<span class='text'>After a disappointing interview, he shut himself in his lodgings and threw all his energies into the composition of an essay which would compel Kant's attention and interest</span>
				<span class='text'>This essay, completed in five weeks, was the ''Versuch einer Kritik aller Offenbarung'' (''[[Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation]]'', 1792)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;americana&quot;/&gt; In this book Fichte investigated the connections between divine revelation and Kant's [[critical philosophy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The first edition of the book was published without Kant or Fichte's knowledge, moreover without Fichte's name or signed preface</span>
				<span class='text'> It was thus mistakenly thought to be a new work by Kant himself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Traditionally, it has been assumed that either the omission was an accident or a deliberate attempt by the publisher to move copies</span>
				<span class='text'>In either case, Fichte did not plan it and in fact only heard of the accident much later</span>
				<span class='text'> He writes to his fianc√©e: &quot;Why did I have to have such utterly strange, excellent, unheard-of good luck?&quot; See Garrett Green's Introduction to ''Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation''</span>
				<span class='text'>Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Reviews were assuming Kant was the author when Kant cleared the confusion and openly praised the work and author</span>
				<span class='text'>Fichte's reputation skyrocketed as many intellectuals of the day were of the opinion that it was &quot;the most shocking and astonishing news</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[since] nobody but Kant could have written this book</span>
				<span class='text'>This amazing news of a third sun in the philosophical heavens has set me into such confusion&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Jena===In October 1793, he was married at Z√ºrich, where he remained the rest of the year</span>
				<span class='text'>Stirred by the events and principles of the [[French Revolution]], he wrote and anonymously published two pamphlets which led to him being seen as a devoted defender of liberty of thought and action and an advocate of political changes</span>
				<span class='text'>In December of the same year, he received an invitation to fill the position of extraordinary professor of philosophy at the [[University of Jena]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He accepted and began his lectures in May of the next year</span>
				<span class='text'>With extraordinary zeal, he expounded his system of &quot;[[transcendental idealism]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>His success was immediate</span>
				<span class='text'>He seems to have excelled as a lecturer because of the earnestness and force of his personality</span>
				<span class='text'>These lectures were later published under the title ''The Vocation of the Scholar''</span>
				<span class='text'>He gave himself up to intense production, and a succession of works soon appeared</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;nie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;americana&quot;/&gt;===Atheism Dispute==={{main|Atheism dispute}}After weathering a couple of academic storms, he was finally dismissed from Jena in 1799 as a result of a charge of atheism</span>
				<span class='text'>He was accused of atheism in 1798 after publishing his essay &quot;Ueber den Grund unsers Glaubens an eine g√∂ttliche Weltregierung&quot; (On the Ground of Our Belief in a Divine World-Governance), which he had written in response to [[Friedrich Karl Forberg]]'s essay &quot;Development of the Concept of Religion,&quot; in his ''Philosophical Journal''</span>
				<span class='text'>No doubt, influenced by the masonic deist philosophy which was not atheism but more an offensive polytheistic claim at the time</span>
				<span class='text'>For Fichte, God should be conceived primarily in moral terms: &quot;The living and efficaciously acting moral order is itself God</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;We require no other God, nor can we grasp any other</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (On the Ground of Our Belief in a Divine World-Governance)</span>
				<span class='text'>==Berlin===Since all the German states except Prussia had joined in the cry against him, he was forced to go to Berlin</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he associated himself with the Schlegels, [[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Ludwig Tieck|Tieck]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;americana&quot;/&gt; In April 1800, through the introduction of Hungarian writer [[Ignaz Aurelius Fessler]], he was initiated into [[Freemasonry]] in the Lodge Pythagoras of the Blazing Star where he was elected minor warden</span>
				<span class='text'>At first Fichte was the warm admirer of Fessler, and was disposed to aid him in his proposed Masonic reform</span>
				<span class='text'> But later he became Fessler's bitter opponent</span>
				<span class='text'>Their controversy attracted much attention among Freemasons</span>

				<span class='text'>The [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|disaster at Jena]] in 1806, in which [[Napoleon]] completely crushed the Prussian army, drove him to K√∂nigsberg for a time, but he returned to Berlin in 1807 and continued his literary activity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;nie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;americana&quot;/&gt;The deplorable situation of Germany stirred him to the depths and led him to deliver the famous ''[[Addresses to the German Nation]]'' (1808) which guided the uprising against Napoleon</span>
				<span class='text'>He became a professor of the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|new university at Berlin]] founded in 1810</span>
				<span class='text'>By the votes of his colleagues Fichte was unanimously elected its rector in the succeeding year</span>
				<span class='text'>But, once more, his impetuosity and reforming zeal led to friction, and he resigned in 1812</span>
				<span class='text'>The campaign against Napoleon began, and the hospitals at Berlin were soon full of patients</span>
				<span class='text'>Fichte's wife devoted herself to nursing and caught a virulent fever</span>
				<span class='text'>Just as she was recovering, he himself was stricken down</span>
				<span class='text'>He died of [[typhus]] at the age of 51</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;nie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;americana&quot;/&gt;His son, [[Immanuel Hermann Fichte]], also made contributions to [[philosophy]]</span>
				<span class='text'>=Fichte's philosophy==In mimicking Kant's difficult style, his critics argued that Fichte produced works that were barely intelligible</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;He made no hesitation in pluming himself on his great skill in the shadowy and obscure, by often remarking to his pupils, that 'there was only one man in the world who could fully understand his writings; and even he was often at a loss to seize upon his real meaning</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Blakely, ''History of the Philosophy of Mind'', Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>IV, p</span>
				<span class='text'>114, London: Longmans, 1850&lt;/ref&gt; This remark was often mistakenly attributed to [[Georg Hegel|Hegel]]</span>
				<span class='text'>{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} On the other hand, Fichte himself acknowledged the difficulty of his writings, but argued that his works were clear and transparent to those who made the effort to think without preconceptions and prejudices</span>
				<span class='text'>ichte did not endorse Kant's argument for the existence of [[noumenon|noumena]], of &quot;things in themselves&quot;, the supra-sensible reality beyond the categories of human [[reason]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Fichte saw the rigorous and [[system]]atic separation of &quot;things in themselves&quot; ([[noumenon|noumena]]) and things &quot;as they appear to us&quot; ([[phenomenon|phenomena]]) as an invitation to [[skepticism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather than invite such skepticism, Fichte made the radical suggestion that we should throw out the notion of a noumenal world and instead accept the fact that [[consciousness]] does not have a grounding in a so-called &quot;real world&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, Fichte achieved fame for originating the argument that consciousness is not grounded in ''anything'' outside of itself</span>
				<span class='text'>The phenomenal world as such, arises from self-consciousness; the activity of the ego; and moral awareness</span>
				<span class='text'>His student (and critic), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], wrote:{{Quotation|</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>ichte who, because the [[thing-in-itself]] had just been discredited, at once prepared a system without any thing-in-itself</span>
				<span class='text'>Consequently, he rejected the assumption of anything that was not through and through merely our [[Representation (psychology)|representation]], and therefore let the knowing [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] be all in all or at any rate produce everything from its own resources</span>
				<span class='text'>For this purpose, he at once did away with the essential and most meritorious part of the [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian doctrine, the distinction between ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' and ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' and thus that between the [[phenomenon]] and the thing-in-itself</span>
				<span class='text'>For he declared everything to be ''a priori'', naturally without any evidence for such a monstrous assertion; instead of these, he gave sophisms and even crazy sham demonstrations whose absurdity was concealed under the mask of profundity and of the incomprehensibility ostensibly arising therefrom</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, he appealed boldly and openly to [[intellectual]] [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], that is, really to [[Invention|inspiration]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Arthur Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>I, ¬ß13}}[[S√∏ren Kierkegaard]] was also a student of the writings of Fichte: {{Quotation|Our whole age is imbued with a formal striving</span>
				<span class='text'>This is what led us to disregard congeniality and to emphasize symmetrical beauty, to prefer conventional rather than sincere social relations</span>
				<span class='text'>It is this whole striving which is denoted by ‚Äî to use the words of another author ‚Äî Fichte's and the other philosophers' attempts to construct systems by sharpness of mind and Robespierre's attempt to do it with the help of the guillotine; it is this which meets us in the flowing butterfly verses of our poets and in Auber's music, and finally, it is this which produces the many revolutions in the political world</span>
				<span class='text'>I agree perfectly with this whole effort to cling to form, insofar as it continues to be the medium through which we have the idea, but it should not be forgotten that it is the idea which should determine the form, not the form which determines the idea</span>
				<span class='text'>We should keep in mind that life is not something abstract but something extremely individual</span>
				<span class='text'>We should not forget that, for example, from a poetic genius' position of immediacy, form is nothing but the coming into existence of the idea in the world, and that the task of reflection is only to investigate whether or not the idea has gotten the properly corresponding form</span>
				<span class='text'>Form is not the basis of life, but life is the basis of form</span>
				<span class='text'>Imagine that a man long infatuated with the Greek mode of life had acquired the means to arrange for a building in the Greek style and a Grecian household establishment ‚Äî whether or not he would be satisfied would be highly problematical, or would he soon prefer another form simply because he had not sufficiently tested himself and the system in which he lived</span>
				<span class='text'>But just as a leap backward is wrong (something the age, on the whole, is inclined to acknowledge), so also a leap forward is wrong ‚Äî both of them because a natural development does not proceed by leaps, and life's earnestness will ironize over every such experiment, even if it succeeds momentarily</span>

				<span class='text'>et/trl/texts/Kierkegaard,Soren/JournPapers/I_B</span>
				<span class='text'>tml Journals of Soren Kierkegaard, 1B]&lt;/ref&gt;}}===Central theory===In his work ''[[Foundations of Natural Right]]'' (1797), Fichte argued that [[self-awareness|self-consciousness]] was a social phenomenon ‚Äî an important step and perhaps the first clear step taken in this direction by modern philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>A necessary condition of every subject's self-awareness, for Fichte, is the existence of other rational subjects</span>
				<span class='text'>These others call or summon (''fordern auf'') the subject or self out of its unconsciousness and into an awareness of itself as a free individual</span>
				<span class='text'>ichte's account proceeds from the general principle that the I must set itself up as an individual in order to set itself up at all, and that in order to set itself up as an individual it must recognize itself as it were to a calling or summons (Aufforderung) by other free individual(s) ‚Äî called, moreover, to limit its own freedom out of respect for the freedom of the other</span>
				<span class='text'>The same condition applied and applies, of course, to the other(s) in its development</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence, mutual recognition of rational individuals turns out to be a condition necessary for the individual 'I' in general</span>
				<span class='text'>This argument for [[intersubjectivity]] is central to the conception of selfhood developed in the ''[[Foundations of the Science of Knowledge|Doctrine of Science]]'' ({{lang-de|Wissenschaftslehre}})</span>
				<span class='text'>In Fichte's view consciousness of the self depends upon resistance or a check by something that is understood as not part of the self yet is not immediately ascribable to a particular sensory perception</span>
				<span class='text'> In his later lectures (his ''Nova Methodo''), Fichte incorporated it into his revised presentation of the very foundations of his system, where the summons takes its place alongside original feeling, which takes the place of the earlier ''Anstoss'' (see below) as both a limit upon the absolute freedom of the I and a condition for the positing of the same</span>
				<span class='text'>he I (''Das Ich'') itself sets this situation up for itself (it posits itself)</span>
				<span class='text'>To 'set' (''setzen'') does not mean to 'create' the objects of consciousness</span>
				<span class='text'>The principle in question simply states that the essence of an I lies in the assertion of ones own self-identity, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> that consciousness presupposes self-consciousness</span>
				<span class='text'>Such immediate self-identity, however, cannot be understood as a psychological fact, nor as an act or accident of some previously existing substance or being</span>
				<span class='text'>It is an action of the I, but one that is identical with the very existence of this same I</span>
				<span class='text'>In Fichte's technical terminology, the original unity of self-consciousness is to be understood as both an action and as the product of the same I, as a fact and/or act (''Tathandlung''), a unity that is presupposed by and contained within every fact and every act of empirical consciousness, though it never appears as such therein</span>
				<span class='text'>he 'I' must posit (''setzen'') itself in order to be an 'I' at all; but it can posit itself only insofar as it posits itself up as limited</span>
				<span class='text'>Moreover, it cannot even posit for itself its own limitations, in the sense of producing or creating these limits</span>
				<span class='text'>The finite I cannot be the ground of its own passivity</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, for Fichte, if the 'I' is to posit itself off at all, it must simply discover itself to be limited, a discovery that Fichte characterizes as a repulse or resistance (''Anstoss''; German: ''[[wikt:Ansto√ü|Ansto√ü]]'') to the free practical activity of the I</span>
				<span class='text'>Such an original limitation of the I is, however, a limit for the I only insofar as the I posits it out as a limit</span>
				<span class='text'>The I does this, according to Fichte's analysis, by positing its own limitation, first, as only a feeling, then as a sensation, then as an intuition of a thing, and finally as a summons of another person</span>
				<span class='text'>The ''Anstoss'' thus provides the essential impetus that first posits in motion the entire complex train of activities that finally result in our conscious experience both of ourselves and others as empirical individuals and of the world around us</span>
				<span class='text'>hough ''Anstoss'' plays a similar role as the [[thing in itself]] does in [[Kantian]] philosophy, unlike Kant, Fichte's ''Anstoss'' is not something foreign to the I</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, it denotes the I's original encounter with its own finitude</span>
				<span class='text'>Rather than claim that the Not-I is the cause or ground of the ''Anstoss'', Fichte argues that non-I is set up by the I precisely in order to explain to itself the ''Anstoss'', that is, in order to become conscious of ''Anstoss''</span>
				<span class='text'>hough the ''Wissenschaftslehre'' demonstrates that such an ''Anstoss'' must occur if self-consciousness is to come about, it is quite unable to deduce or to explain the actual occurrence of such an ''Anstoss'' ‚Äî except as a condition for the possibility of consciousness</span>
				<span class='text'>Accordingly, there are strict limits to what can be expected from any a priori deduction of experience, and this limitation, for Fichte, equally applies to Kant's transcendental philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>ccording to Fichte, transcendental philosophy can explain that the world must have space, time, and causality, but it can never explain why objects have the particular sensible properties they happen to have or why I am this determinate individual rather than another</span>
				<span class='text'>This is something that the I simply has to discover at the same time that it discovers its own freedom, and indeed, as a condition for the latter</span>
				<span class='text'>==Other works===Fichte also developed a theory of the state based on the idea of self-sufficiency</span>
				<span class='text'>In his mind, the state should control international relations, the value of money, and remain an [[autarky]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Because of this necessity to have relations with other rational beings in order to achieve consciousness, Fichte writes that there must be a 'relation of right,' in which there is a mutual recognition of rationality by both parties</span>
				<span class='text'>==Nationalism===Fichte's philosophical and humanitarian virtues fueled his national efforts, as nationalism proved to be mode he saw fit to carry out his ideals</span>
				<span class='text'>Fichte was a man of action and believed it his duty to actively create a better world for humanity</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1790 Fichte disclosed a frame of mind which might easily lead to the life of a reformer, and wrote, &quot;I wish not to merely think; I want to act</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>I have only one passion, one need, one complete feeling of myself, that is, to work for humanity</span>

				<span class='text'>Fichte remarked, &quot;I now believe with all my heart in the freedom of man and perceive with this belief are duty, virtue, and any ethics at all possible</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>It is, furthermore, clear to me that results extremely harmful to society proceed from the acceptance of the principle of determinism and that the great moral depravity of the so-called better classes mainly flows from this source</span>

				<span class='text'>It is important to note the impacts the French Revolution had on Fichte, as it further sustained his objections against absolutism and his faith in freedom</span>
				<span class='text'> Fichte explained his approval of Revolutionary France by stating, &quot;I am more than certain that if the French do not acquire a dominance and make changes in Germany</span>

				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>He believed other cosmopolitans shared his virtues, and saw the new French state as an ally that embodied his philosophical values</span>
				<span class='text'>However,  by 1804 Fichte's views toward France took a drastic turn witnessing Napoleon's armies advance through Europe, that would occupy German territories, strip them of their raw materials and subjugate them to foreign rule</span>
				<span class='text'>When France committed what Fichte considered an atrocity before humanity, the abstinence of embracing their own ideals, he contested Germany would be responsible to carry the French Revolution virtues into the future</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, his nationalism was not aroused by Prussia military defeat and humiliation, for these had not yet occurred, but resulted from devotion to his own humanitarian philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>Through disappointment in the French he turned to the German &quot;nation&quot; as the instrument of fulfilling it</span>
