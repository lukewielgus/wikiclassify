				<span class='text'>Although few events in Smith's early childhood are known, the Scottish journalist [[John Rae (biographer)|John Rae]], Smith's biographer, recorded that Smith was abducted by gypsies at the age of three and released when others went to rescue him</span>
				<span class='text'>{refn|In ''Life of Adam Smith'', Rae writes, &quot;In his fourth year, while on a visit to his grandfather's house at Strathendry on the banks of the Leven, [Smith] was stolen by a passing band of gypsies, and for a time could not be found</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;Adam Smith considered the teaching at Glasgow to be far superior to that at Oxford, which he found intellectually stifling</span>

				<span class='text'>He attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished [[Intellectual#Man of Letters|men of letters]] could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the [[Church of England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Buchholz 1999 12&quot; /&gt;Adam Smith's discontent at Oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in Glasgow, [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the University of Glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students, colleagues, and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations (which he sometimes opened to the public)</span>
				<span class='text'>His lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy but to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives, appropriately acquiring the epithet, the preacher of philosophy</span>
				<span class='text'>Unlike Smith, Hutcheson was not a system builder; rather it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as &quot;the never to be forgotten Hutcheson&quot; – a title that Smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people, his good friend [[David Hume]] and influential mentor [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;rae 1895 42&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1895|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;Smith published ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'' in 1759, embodying some of his Glasgow lectures</span>
				<span class='text'>This work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator, or the individual and other members of society</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith defined &quot;mutual sympathy&quot; as the basis of [[Moral sense theory|moral sentiments]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He based his explanation, not on a special &quot;moral sense&quot; as the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Third Lord Shaftesbury]] and Hutcheson had done, nor on [[utilitarianism|utility]] as Hume did, but on mutual sympathy, a term best captured in modern parlance by the twentieth-century concept of [[empathy]], the capacity to recognise feelings that are being experienced by another being</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing the publication of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at Glasgow to learn under Smith</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchholz|1999|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments'', Smith began to give more attention to [[jurisprudence]] and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buchan|2006|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labour, rather than the nation's quantity of gold or silver, which is the basis for [[mercantilism]], the [[economic theory]] that dominated Western European economic policies at the time</span>

				<span class='text'>Assuming that nobility and church are essentially detractors from economic growth, the feudal system of agriculture in France was the only sector important to maintain the wealth of the nation</span>
				<span class='text'>Given that the English economy of the day yielded an income distribution that stood in contrast to that which existed in France, Smith concluded that the teachings and beliefs of Physiocrats were, &quot;with all [their] imperfections [perhaps], the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of political economy&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>This last statement about &quot;an invisible hand&quot; has been interpreted in numerous ways</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;blockquote&gt;As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can</span>
				<span class='text'>He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it</span>
				<span class='text'>By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention</span>
				<span class='text'>Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it</span>
				<span class='text'>By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it</span>
				<span class='text'>I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good</span>
				<span class='text'>It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;Those who regard that statement as Smith's central message also quote frequently Smith's dictum:&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A</span>

				<span class='text'>Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity, or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs</span>

				<span class='text'>0)&lt;/blockquote&gt;The neoclassical interest in Smith's statement about &quot;an invisible hand&quot; originates in the possibility to see it as a precursor of [[neoclassical economics]] and its [[General equilibrium theory|General Equilibrium]] concept</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; concluded: &quot;Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine</span>
				<span class='text'>Indeed, until the 1940s no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Very differently, classical economists see in Smith's first sentences his programme to promote &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Taking up the [[Physiocracy|physiocratical]] concept of the economy as a circular process means that to have growth the inputs of period2 must excel the inputs of period1</span>
				<span class='text'>Therefore, the outputs of period1 not used or usable as input of period2 are regarded as unproductive labour as they do not contribute to growth</span>
				<span class='text'>This is what Smith had heard in France from, among others, [[François Quesnay|Quesnay]]</span>
				<span class='text'>To this French insight that unproductive labour should be pushed back to use labour more productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the [[division of labour]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity, which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living—&quot;general plenty&quot; and &quot;universal opulence&quot;—for all</span>
				<span class='text'>Extended markets and increased production lead to continuous reorganisation of production and inventing new ways of producing, which lead to further increased production, lower prices, and increased standards of living</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith's central message is therefore that under dynamic competition a growth machine secures &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith's argument predicted Britain's evolution as the workshop of the world, underselling and outproducing all its competitors</span>
				<span class='text'>The opening sentences of the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; summarise this policy:&lt;blockquote&gt;The annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes </span>
				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>B]ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances;* first, by the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which its labour is generally applied; and,* secondly, by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour, and that of those who are not so employed [emphasis added]</span>

				<span class='text'>df]&lt;/ref&gt;Smith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security, though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions</span>
				<span class='text'>But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence</span>
				<span class='text'>Wherever there is great property there is great inequality</span>
				<span class='text'>For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many</span>
				<span class='text'>The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions</span>
				<span class='text'>It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security</span>
				<span class='text'>He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it</span>
				<span class='text'>The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government</span>
				<span class='text'>Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days' labour, civil government is not so necessary</span>
				<span class='text'>Civil government supposes a certain subordination</span>
				<span class='text'>But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property</span>
				<span class='text'>(</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs</span>
				<span class='text'>All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them</span>
				<span class='text'>They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority</span>
				<span class='text'>Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all</span>

				<span class='text'>''The Wealth of Nations'' would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question</span>
				<span class='text'>In his chapter on colonies, Smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the Atlantic among the empire's thirteen American colonies</span>
				<span class='text'>He offered two different proposals for easing tensions</span>
				<span class='text'>The first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence and, by thus parting on a friendly basis, Britain would be able to develop and maintain a free-trade relationship with them, and possibly even an informal military alliance</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith's second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade</span>

				<span class='text'>Benians, ‘Adam Smith’s project of an empire’, ''Cambridge Historical Journal'' 1 (1925): 249-283&lt;/ref&gt;Smith's most prominent disciple in nineteenth-century Britain, peace advocate [[Richard Cobden]], preferred the first proposal</span>
				<span class='text'>Cobden would lead the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] in overturning the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846, shifting Britain to a policy of free trade and empire &quot;on the cheap&quot; for decades to come</span>
				<span class='text'>This hands-off approach toward the British Empire would become known as [[Cobdenism]] or the [[Manchester Liberalism|Manchester School]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Anthony Howe, ''Free trade and liberal England, 1846-1946'' (Oxford, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the century, however, advocates of Smith's second proposal such as [[Joseph Shield Nicholson]] would become ever more vocal in opposing Cobdenism, calling instead for imperial federation</span>

				<span class='text'>On the other, various proponents of imperial federation throughout the British World sought to use Smith’s theories to overturn the predominant Cobdenite hands-off imperial approach and instead, with a firm grip, bring the empire closer than ever before</span>

				<span class='text'>He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>et he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system</span>
				<span class='text'>He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In Stein's reading, ''The Wealth of Nations'' could justify the [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], mandatory employer health benefits, environmentalism, and &quot;[[Pigovian tax|discriminatory taxation]] to deter [[sin tax|improper]] or [[sumptuary tax|luxurious behavior]]&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>)</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting &quot;justice&quot; and &quot;certain publick institutions&quot; that were necessary for the benefit of all of society but that could not be provided by private enterprise (''The Wealth of Nations,'' IV</span>
				<span class='text'>x</span>
				<span class='text'>1)</span>
				<span class='text'>dditionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in ''The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch</span>
				<span class='text'>I''</span>
				<span class='text'>Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defence and regulate banking</span>
				<span class='text'>It was the role of the government to provide goods &quot;of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual&quot; such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours</span>
				<span class='text'>He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies</span>
				<span class='text'>He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education, and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society</span>
				<span class='text'>In such cases, however, Smith argued for local rather than centralised control: &quot;Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a local and provincial administration, than by the general revenue of the state&quot; (''Wealth of Nations,'' V</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>8)</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion</span>
				<span class='text'>He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because &quot;we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a [[doge]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1977|loc=bk</span>
				<span class='text'>V}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he allowed that in some specific circumstances retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A</span>

				<span class='text'>2a, p</span>
				<span class='text'>468</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;He added, however, that in general a retaliatory tariff &quot;seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people, to do another injury ourselves, not only to those classes, but to almost all the other classes of them&quot; (''The Wealth of Nations,'' IV</span>

				<span class='text'>Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free market economist without exception, though he was not</span>
				<span class='text'>Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries</span>
				<span class='text'>Smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood it would be unwilling to surrender the government help</span>

				<span class='text'>Indeed, Smith wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The price of labour, it must be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters</span>
				<span class='text'>Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do so</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; (Source: The Wealth of Nations, Book 1, Chapter 8)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Smith also noted a rough [[equality of bargaining power]]:&lt;ref&gt;A Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (1776) Book I, ch 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired</span>
				<span class='text'>Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment</span>
				<span class='text'>In the long run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him; but the necessity is not so immediate</span>
