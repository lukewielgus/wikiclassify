				<span class='text'>He later used paint pouring as one of several techniques on canvases of the early 1940s, such as ''Male and Female'' and ''Composition with Pouring I</span>
				<span class='text'>' After his move to Springs, he began painting with his canvases laid out on the studio floor, and he developed what was later called his &quot;[[drip painting|drip]]&quot; technique</span>
				<span class='text'>e started using synthetic resin-based paints called [[alkyd]] enamels, which, at that time, was a novel medium</span>

				<span class='text'>Pollock's technique of pouring and dripping paint is thought to be one of the origins of the term [[action painting]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With this technique, Pollock was able to achieve a more immediate means of creating art, the paint now literally flowing from his chosen tool onto the canvas</span>
				<span class='text'>By defying the convention of painting on an upright surface, he added a new dimension by being able to view and apply paint to his canvases from all directions</span>

				<span class='text'>Referring to his style of painting on the floor, Pollock stated, ‚ÄúI feel nearer, more a part of the painting, since this way I can walk round it, work from the four sides and literally be in the painting</span>
				<span class='text'>This is akin to the methods of the Indian sand painters of the West</span>

				<span class='text'>65; originally published in ''Possibilities'' I, New York, Winter 1947-48&lt;/ref&gt; Other influences on his drip technique include the Mexican [[mural]]ists and [[Surrealist]] automatism</span>
				<span class='text'>Pollock denied reliance on &quot;the accident&quot;; he usually had an idea of how he wanted a particular piece to appear</span>
				<span class='text'>His technique combined the movement of his body, over which he had control, the viscous flow of paint, the force of gravity, and the absorption of paint into the canvas</span>
				<span class='text'>It was a mixture of controllable and uncontrollable factors</span>
				<span class='text'>Flinging, dripping, pouring, and spattering, he would move energetically around the canvas, almost as if in a dance, and would not stop until he saw what he wanted to see</span>
				<span class='text'>As another important influence can be cited [[Wolfgang Paalen]]¬¥s article on ''Totem Art'' of the indigenous people of British Columbia and his [[Fumage]] paintings which he had seen at Julien Levy¬¥s exhibition of Paalen¬¥s surrealist paintings in 1940</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;¬ªIn Mexico City, he [Motherwell] visited Wolfgang Paalen whose show Baziotes and Jackson [Pollock] had seen at the Julien Levy Gallery the year before</span>
				<span class='text'>´ Steven Naifeh, p</span>
				<span class='text'>414</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Pollock owned a signed and dedicated copy of the Amerindian Number of Paalen¬¥s magazine (DYN 4-5, 1943), in which the revolutionary space concept in totemist art from the North-West-Coast is broadly discussed from an artist¬¥s point of view</span>
				<span class='text'>Another strong impact must have been Paalen¬¥s fumage technique, as it was the surrealist technique with the most magic appeal for those painters who looked for new ways of making appear what was called the ''unseen'' or the ''possible''</span>
				<span class='text'>Fumage was presented also in Matta¬¥s workshop about which Steven Naifeh reports: ¬ªOnce, when Matta was demonstrating the Surrealist technique [Paalen¬¥s] Fumage, Jackson [Pollock] turned to Busa and said in a stage whisper: ‚Ä∫I can do that without the smoke</span>
				<span class='text'>Äπ¬´&lt;ref&gt;Steven Naifeh, p</span>
				<span class='text'>427</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Pollock¬¥s painter friend Fritz Bultman even stated (hinting at the revolutionary possibility-space of Paalen): &quot;It was Wolfgang Paalen, who started it all</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|right|Pollock's studio in [[Springs, New York]]]]In 1950, [[Hans Namuth]], a young photographer, wanted to take pictures (both stills and moving) of Pollock at work</span>
				<span class='text'>Pollock promised to start a new painting especially for the photographic session, but when Namuth arrived, Pollock apologized and told him the painting was finished</span>
				<span class='text'>amuth said that when he entered the studio:{{quote|A dripping wet canvas covered the entire floor ‚Ä¶ There was complete silence ‚Ä¶ Pollock looked at the painting</span>
				<span class='text'> Then, unexpectedly, he picked up can and paint brush and started to move around the canvas</span>
				<span class='text'>It was as if he suddenly realized the painting was not finished</span>
				<span class='text'>His movements, slow at first, gradually became faster and more dance like as he flung black, white, and rust colored paint onto the canvas</span>
				<span class='text'>He completely forgot that Lee and I were there; he did not seem to hear the click of the camera shutter ‚Ä¶ My photography session lasted as long as he kept painting, perhaps half an hour</span>
				<span class='text'>In all that time, Pollock did not stop</span>
				<span class='text'>How could one keep up this level of activity?  Finally, he said 'This is it</span>
				<span class='text'>Pollock‚Äôs finest paintings‚Ä¶ reveal that his all-over line does not give rise to positive or negative areas: we are not made to feel that one part of the canvas demands to be read as figure, whether abstract or representational, against another part of the canvas read as ground</span>
				<span class='text'>There is not inside or outside to Pollock‚Äôs line or the space through which it moves‚Ä¶</span>
				<span class='text'>Pollock has managed to free line not only from its function of representing objects in the world, but also from its task of describing or bounding shapes or figures, whether abstract or representational, on the surface of the canvas</span>
