				<span class='text'>Petersburg]]), he advocated widespread reforms</span>
				<span class='text'>The reforms began with personnel changes, most notably by replacing [[Andrei Gromyko]] with [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] as Minister of Foreign Affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>Gromyko, disparaged as &quot;Mr Nyet&quot; in the West, had served in the post for 28 years and was considered an 'old thinker'</span>
				<span class='text'>Robert D</span>
				<span class='text'>English notes that, despite Shevardnadze's diplomatic inexperience, Gorbachev &quot;shared with him an outlook&quot; and experience in managing an agricultural region of the Soviet Union ([[Georgian SSR|Georgia]]), which meant that both had weak links to the powerful [[military-industrial complex]]</span>

				<span class='text'> D, ''Russia and the Idea of the West: Gorbachev, Intellectuals and the End of the Cold War'', 2000 (Columbia University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;A number of reformist ideas were discussed by Politburo members</span>
				<span class='text'>One of the first reforms Gorbachev introduced was the anti-alcohol campaign, begun in May 1985, which was designed to fight widespread alcoholism in the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>Prices of vodka, wine, and beer were raised, and their sales were restricted</span>
				<span class='text'>It was pursued vigorously and cut both alcohol sales and government revenue</span>

				<span class='text'>124–125&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, alcohol production migrated to the [[black market]] economy and dealt a blow to state revenue—a loss of approximately 100&amp;nbsp;billion rubles, according to [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the program proved to be a useful symbol for change in the country</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;jfh124125&quot; /&gt;The purpose of reform was to prop up the [[Planned economy|centrally planned economy]]—not to transition to [[market socialism]]</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Gorbachev at the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in 1986 during a visit to [[East Germany]]]]Gorbachev initiated his new policy of ''perestroika'' (literally &quot;restructuring&quot; in [[Russian language|Russian]]) and its attendant radical reforms in 1986; they were sketched, but not fully spelled out, at the [[Congress of the CPSU|XXVIIth Party Congress]] in February–March 1986</span>
				<span class='text'>The &quot;reconstruction&quot; was proposed in an attempt to overcome the economic stagnation by creating a dependable and effective mechanism for accelerating economic and social progress</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;mk322&quot;&gt;Kishlansky, Mark (2001), p</span>
				<span class='text'>322&lt;/ref&gt;According to Gorbachev, ''perestroika'' was the &quot;conference of development of democracy, socialist self-government, encouragement of initiative and creative endeavor, improved order and disciple,{{Verify source|should this be &quot;discipline&quot;?|date=September 2010}} more glasnost, criticism and self-criticism in all spheres of our society</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;mk322&quot; /&gt;Domestic changes continued</span>
				<span class='text'>In a bombshell speech during [[Armenian SSR]]'s Central Committee Plenum of the Communist Party, the young First Secretary of Armenia's Hrazdan Regional Communist Party, [[Hayk Kotanjian]], criticised rampant corruption in the Armenian Communist Party's highest echelons, implicating Armenian SSR Communist Party First Secretary [[Karen Demirchyan]] and calling for his resignation</span>
				<span class='text'>Symbolically, intellectual [[Andrei Sakharov]] was invited to return to Moscow by Gorbachev in December 1986 after six years of internal exile in [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During the same month, however, signs of the nationalities problem that would haunt the later years of the Soviet Union surfaced as riots, named [[Jeltoqsan]], occurred in Kazakhstan after [[Dinmukhamed Kunayev]] was replaced as First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>he Central Committee Plenum in January 1987 saw the crystallisation of Gorbachev's political reforms, including proposals for multi-candidate elections and the appointment of non-Party members to government positions</span>
				<span class='text'>He also first raised the idea of expanding co-operatives</span>
				<span class='text'>Economic reforms took up much of the rest of 1987, as a new law giving enterprises more independence was passed in June and Gorbachev released a book, ''Perestroika: New Thinking for Our Country and the World'', in November, elucidating his main ideas for reform</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1987, he rehabilitated many opponents of [[Joseph Stalin]]—another part of the [[History of the Soviet Union (1953–64)|De-Stalinization]], which began in 1956, when [[Lenin's Testament]] was published</span>

				<span class='text'>The press became far less controlled, and thousands of political prisoners and many dissidents were released</span>
				<span class='text'>Gorbachev's goal in undertaking ''glasnost'' was to pressure conservatives within the CPSU who opposed his policies of economic restructuring, and he also hoped that through different ranges of openness, debate and participation, the Soviet people would support his reform initiatives</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, he opened himself and his reforms up for more public criticism, evident in [[Nina Andreyeva]]'s critical letter in a March edition of ''[[Sovetskaya Rossiya]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Memoirs /&gt; Gorbachev acknowledged that his liberalising policies of ''glasnost'' and ''perestroika'' owed a great deal to [[Alexander Dubček]]'s &quot;Socialism with a human face&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>For the first time since [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]], the law permitted private ownership of businesses in the service, manufacturing, and foreign-trade sectors</span>
				<span class='text'>The law initially imposed high taxes and employment restrictions, although these were ignored by some SSRs</span>
				<span class='text'>Later, the restrictions were revised to avoid discouraging private-sector activity</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the provision for private ownership, cooperative restaurants, shops, and manufacturers became part of the Soviet scene</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the new law, the restructuring of large &quot;All-Union&quot; industrial organizations also began</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Aeroflot]] was split up, eventually becoming several independent airlines</span>
				<span class='text'>These newly autonomous business organisations were encouraged to seek foreign investment</span>
				<span class='text'>n June 1988, at the CPSU's Party Conference, Gorbachev launched radical reforms meant to reduce party control of the government apparatus</span>
				<span class='text'>He proposed a new executive in the form of a presidential system, as well as a new legislative element, to be called the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Memoirs /&gt; Elections to the Congress of People's Deputies were held throughout the Soviet Union in March and April 1989</span>
				<span class='text'>This was the first free election in the Soviet Union since 1917</span>
				<span class='text'>Gorbachev became [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|Chairman of the Supreme Soviet]] (or head of state) on 25 May 1989</span>
				<span class='text'>==Presidency of the USSR===On 15 March 1990, Gorbachev was elected as the first executive [[President of the Soviet Union]] with 59% of the Deputies' votes</span>
				<span class='text'>He was the sole candidate on the ballot</span>
				<span class='text'>The Congress met for the first time on 25 May in order to elect representatives from Congress to sit on the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>Nonetheless, the Congress posed problems for Gorbachev: its sessions were televised, airing more criticism and encouraging people to expect ever more rapid reform</span>
				<span class='text'>In the elections, many Party candidates were defeated</span>
				<span class='text'>Furthermore, [[Boris Yeltsin]] was elected in Moscow and returned to political prominence to become an increasingly vocal critic of Gorbachev</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;Following American practice, Gorbachev chose a [[Vice President of the Soviet Union|Vice President]]</span>
				<span class='text'> However, when first Shevardnadze, then [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] leader [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], turned it down, Gorbachev chose [[Gennady Yanayev]], the head of the [[All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions]] and a known hardliner</span>

				<span class='text'> ''Reagan and Gorbachev: How the Cold War Ended'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt;On 11 October 1986, Gorbachev and Reagan met at [[Höfði]] house in [[Reykjavík]], [[Iceland]], to discuss reducing intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>To the immense surprise of both men's advisers, the two agreed in principle to removing INF systems from Europe and to equal global limits of 100 INF missile warheads</span>
				<span class='text'>They also essentially agreed in principle to eliminate all nuclear weapons in 10 years (by 1996), instead of by the year 2000 as in Gorbachev's original outline</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Matlock/&gt; Continuing trust issues, particularly over reciprocity and Reagan's [[Strategic Defense Initiative|Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)]], meant that the summit is often regarded as a failure for not producing a concrete agreement immediately, or for leading to a staged elimination of nuclear weapons</span>
				<span class='text'>In the long term, nevertheless, this would culminate in the signing of the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty]] in 1987, after Gorbachev had proposed this elimination on 22 July 1987 (and it was subsequently agreed on in Geneva on 24 November)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;In February 1988, Gorbachev announced the full withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan</span>
				<span class='text'>The withdrawal was completed the following year, although the civil war continued as the [[Mujahedin]] pushed to overthrow the pro-Soviet [[Mohammad Najibullah|Najibullah]] government</span>
				<span class='text'> An estimated 28,000 Soviets were killed between 1979 and 1989 as a result of the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Afghanistan War]]</span>
				<span class='text'>[File:Reagan and Gorbachev hold discussions</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Gorbachev in one-on-one discussions with [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]]]Also during 1988, Gorbachev announced that the Soviet Union would abandon the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], and allow the [[Eastern bloc]] nations to freely determine their own internal affairs</span>
				<span class='text'>Jokingly dubbed the &quot;[[Sinatra Doctrine]]&quot; by Gorbachev's Foreign Ministry spokesman [[Gennadi Gerasimov]], this policy of non-intervention in the affairs of the other [[Warsaw Pact]] states proved to be the most momentous of Gorbachev's foreign policy reforms</span>
				<span class='text'>In his 6 July 1989 speech arguing for a &quot;[[common European home]]&quot; before the [[Council of Europe]] in [[Strasbourg]], France, Gorbachev declared: &quot;The social and political order in some countries changed in the past, and it can change in the future too, but this is entirely a matter for each people to decide</span>
				<span class='text'>Any interference in the internal affairs, or any attempt to limit the sovereignty of another state, friend, ally, or another, would be inadmissible</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; A month earlier, on 4 June 1989, elections had taken place in Poland and the communist government had already been deposed</span>
				<span class='text'>oscow's abandonment of the Brezhnev Doctrine allowed the rise of popular upheavals in Eastern Europe throughout 1989, in which Communism was overthrown</span>
				<span class='text'>By the end of 1989, revolts had spread from one Eastern European capital to another, ousting the regimes built in Eastern Europe after World War II</span>
				<span class='text'>Except in Romania, the popular upheavals against the pro-Soviet regimes were all peaceful (''see [[Revolutions of 1989]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>The loosening of Soviet hegemony over Eastern Europe effectively ended the Cold War, and for this, Gorbachev was awarded the [[Otto Hahn Peace Medal|Otto Hahn Peace Medal in Gold]] in 1989 and the Nobel Peace Prize on 15 October 1990</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Gorbachev ever intended for the dismantling of Communism in Warsaw Pact countries</span>

				<span class='text'> By the end of the 1980s, severe shortages of basic food supplies (meat, sugar) led to the reintroduction of the war-time system of distribution using food cards that limited each citizen to a certain amount of product per month</span>
				<span class='text'>Compared to 1985, the state deficit grew from 0 to 109&amp;nbsp;billion rubles; gold funds decreased from 2,000 to 200 tons; and external debt grew from 0 to 120&amp;nbsp;billion dollars</span>
				<span class='text'>urthermore, the [[Democratisation in the Soviet Union|democratisation]] of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe had irreparably undermined the power of the CPSU and Gorbachev himself</span>
				<span class='text'>The relaxation of censorship and attempts to create more political openness had the unintended effect of re-awakening long-suppressed nationalist and anti-Russian feelings in the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Calls for greater independence from Moscow's rule grew louder, especially in the [[Baltic states|Baltic republics]] of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, which had been annexed into the Soviet Union by Joseph Stalin in 1940</span>
				<span class='text'>Nationalist feeling also took hold in Georgia, Ukraine, Armenia, and Azerbaijan</span>
				<span class='text'>n December 1986, the first signs of the nationalities problem that would haunt the later years of the Soviet Union's existence surfaced as riots, named [[Jeltoqsan]], occurred in [[Almaty|Alma Ata]] and other areas of Kazakhstan after [[Dinmukhamed Kunayev]] was replaced as First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Nationalism would then surface in Russia in May 1987, as 600 members of [[Pamyat]], a nascent Russian nationalist group, demonstrated in Moscow and were becoming increasingly linked to [[Boris Yeltsin]], who received their representatives at a meeting</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;Glasnost hastened awareness of the national sovereignty problem</span>
				<span class='text'>The free flow of information had been so completely suppressed for so long in the Soviet Union that many of the ruling class had all but forgotten that the Soviet Union was an empire conquered through military force</span>

				<span class='text'>Turmoil would once again return in late 1988, this time in Armenia itself, when the [[1988 Armenian earthquake|Spitak earthquake]] hit the region on 7 December</span>
				<span class='text'>Poor local infrastructure magnified the hazard and some 25,000 people died</span>

				<span class='text'>The televised Congress debates allowed the dissemination of pro-independence propositions</span>

				<span class='text'>During the speech he dramatically announced deep unilateral cuts in Soviet military forces in Eastern Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>][[9 April tragedy|9 April]] would see the crackdown of nationalist demonstrations by Soviet troops in [[Tbilisi]], Georgia</span>
				<span class='text'>There would be further bloody protests in Uzbekistan in June, where Uzbeks and Meskhetian Turks clashed in [[Fergana]], [[Uzbekistan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Apart from this violence, three major events that altered the face of the nationalities issue occurred in 1989</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Estonian Sovereignty Declaration|Estonia had declared its sovereignty]] on 16 November 1988, to be followed by Lithuania in May 1989 and by Latvia in July (the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] would also declare its independence from the CPSU in December)</span>
				<span class='text'>This brought the Union and the republics into clear confrontation and would form a precedent for other republics</span>
				<span class='text'>round the 50th anniversary of the signing of the 1939 [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] in July 1989, the Soviet government formally acknowledged that the plan had included the placing of the Baltic states into the Soviet [[sphere of influence]], which paved the way for their annexation into the USSR in 1940</span>
				<span class='text'>The revelation supported the long-denied proposition that the Baltic states had been involuntarily brought into the Soviet Union, and so it boosted the Baltic aspirations to reestablish their independence</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, the Eastern bloc fragmented in the autumn of 1989, raising hopes that Gorbachev would extend his [[non-intervention]]ist doctrine to the internal workings of the USSR</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;=====Crisis of the Union: 1990–1991=====1990 began with nationalist turmoil in January</span>
				<span class='text'>Azerbaijanis rioted and troops were sent in to restore order; many [[Moldova]]ns demonstrated in favour of unification with post-Communist Romania; and Lithuanian demonstrations continued</span>
				<span class='text'>The same month, in a hugely significant move, Armenia asserted its right to veto laws coming from the All-Union level, thus intensifying the &quot;war of laws&quot; between republics and Moscow</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;Soon after, the CPSU, which had already lost much of its control, began to lose even more power as Gorbachev deepened political reform</span>
				<span class='text'>The February Central Committee Plenum advocated multi-party elections; local elections held between February and March returned a large number of pro-independence candidates</span>
				<span class='text'>The Congress of People's Deputies then amended the Soviet Constitution in March, removing Article 6, which guaranteed the monopoly of the CPSU</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus, the political reform came from above and below, and gained momentum that would augment republican nationalism</span>
				<span class='text'>Soon after the constitutional amendment, Lithuania declared independence and elected [[Vytautas Landsbergis]] as Chairman of the [[Lithuanian Supreme Council|Supreme Council]] (head of state)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;On 15 March, Gorbachev himself was elected as the first—and as it turned out, only—President of the Soviet Union by the Congress of People's Deputies and chose a [[Presidential Council (USSR)|Presidential Council]] of 15 politicians</span>
				<span class='text'>Gorbachev was essentially creating his own political support base independent of CPSU conservatives and radical reformers</span>
				<span class='text'>The new Executive was designed to be a powerful position to guide the spiraling reform process, and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and Congress of People's Deputies had already given Gorbachev increasingly presidential powers in February</span>
				<span class='text'>This was again criticized by reformers</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite the apparent increase in Gorbachev's power, he was unable to stop the process of nationalistic assertion</span>
				<span class='text'>Further embarrassing facts about Soviet history were revealed in April, when the government admitted that the [[NKVD]] had carried out the infamous [[Katyn Massacre]] of Polish army officers during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]; previously, the USSR had blamed [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Germany]]</span>
				<span class='text'>More significantly for Gorbachev's position, Boris Yeltsin reached a new level of prominence, as he was elected [[Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR]] in May, effectively making him the de jure leader of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Problems for Gorbachev once again came from the Russian parliament in June, when it declared the precedence of Russian laws over All-Union-level legislation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;[[File:RIAN archive 699872 Dushanbe riots, February 1990</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Anti-Armenian and anti-government [[1990 Dushanbe riots|Dushanbe riots]] in [[Tajikistan]], 1990]]Gorbachev's personal position continued changing</span>
				<span class='text'>At the [[28th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|28th CPSU Congress]] in July, Gorbachev was re-elected General Secretary but this position was now completely independent of Soviet government, and the Politburo had no say in the ruling of the country</span>
				<span class='text'>Gorbachev further reduced Party power in the same month, when he issued a decree abolishing Party control of all areas of the media and broadcasting</span>
				<span class='text'>At the same time, Gorbachev worked to consolidate his presidential position, culminating in the Supreme Soviet granting him special powers to rule by decree in September in order to pass a much-needed plan for transition to a market economy</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the Supreme Soviet could not agree on which program to adopt</span>
				<span class='text'>Gorbachev pressed on with political reform, his proposal for setting up a new Soviet government, with a Soviet of the Federation consisting of representatives from all 15 republics, was passed through the Supreme Soviet in November</span>
				<span class='text'>In December, Gorbachev was once more granted increased executive power by the Supreme Soviet, arguing that such moves were necessary to counter &quot;the dark forces of [[nationalism]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Such moves led to [[Eduard Shevardnadze]]'s resignation; Gorbachev's former ally warned of an impending dictatorship</span>
				<span class='text'>This move was a serious blow to Gorbachev personally and to his efforts for reform</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;Meanwhile, Gorbachev was losing further ground to nationalists</span>
				<span class='text'>October 1990 saw the founding of [[Democratic Russia|DemRossiya]], the Russian pro-reform coalition; a few days later, both Ukraine and Russia declared their laws completely sovereign over Soviet laws</span>
				<span class='text'>The 'war of laws' had become an open battle, with the Supreme Soviet refusing to recognise the actions of the two republics</span>
				<span class='text'>Gorbachev would publish the draft of a new union treaty in November, which envisioned a continued union called the [[Union of Sovereign States|Union of Sovereign Soviet Republics]], but, going into 1991, Gorbachev's actions of were steadily overpowered by secessionism</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;[[File:RIAN archive 428452 Germany becomes one country</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Berlin Wall, &quot;Thank you, Gorbi!&quot;, October 1990]]January and February would see a new level of turmoil in the [[Baltic republics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>On 10 January 1991, Gorbachev issued an ultimatum-like request addressing the Lithuanian Supreme Council demanding the restoration of the validity of the constitution of the Soviet Union in Lithuania and revocation of all anti-constitutional laws</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;DR Radio reported 12/01 in its news broadcast on P3 at 13:00 hrs that the Ultimatum required a reply within three days</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Memoirs'', Gorbachev asserts that on 12 January he convened the Council of the Federation which agreed to political measures to prevent bloodshed, including sending representatives of the Council of the Federation on a &quot;fact-finding mission&quot; to [[Vilnius]]</span>
				<span class='text'>However, before the delegation arrived, the local branches of the [[KGB]] and armed forces had worked together to seize the TV tower in Vilnius; Gorbachev asked the heads of the KGB and military if they had approved such action, and there is no evidence that they, or Gorbachev, ever did</span>
				<span class='text'>Gorbachev cites documents found in the RSFSR Prokuratura after the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt#August coup|August coup]], which only mentioned that &quot;some 'authorities'&quot; had sanctioned the actions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;The book ''Alpha&amp;nbsp;– the KGB's Top Secret Unit'' also suggests that a &quot;KGB operation co-ordinated with the military&quot; was undertaken by the KGB [[Alpha Group]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Alpha&gt;Boltunov, M</span>
				<span class='text'> ''Alfa&amp;nbsp;– Sverkhsekretnyi Otryad KGB [Alpha&amp;nbsp;– The KGB's Top-Secret Unit]'', 1992, (Moscow: Kedr)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archie Brown]], in ''The Gorbachev Factor'', uses the memoirs of many people around Gorbachev and in the upper echelons of the Soviet political landscape, to implicate General [[Valentin Varennikov]], a member of the August coup plotters, and General [[Vladislav Achalov]], another August coup conspirator</span>
				<span class='text'>These persons were characterised as individuals &quot;who were prepared to remove Gorbachev from his presidential office unconstitutionally&quot; and &quot;were more than capable of using unauthorised violence against nationalist separatists some months earlier&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Archie Brown|Brown]] criticises Gorbachev for &quot;a conscious tilt in the direction of the conservative forces he was trying to keep within an increasingly fragile coalition&quot; who would later betray him; he also criticises Gorbachev &quot;for his tougher line and heightened rhetoric against the Lithuanians in the days preceding the attack and for his slowness in condemning the killings&quot; but notes that Gorbachev did not approve any action and was seeking political solutions</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brown&gt;[[Archie Brown]], ''The Gorbachev Factor'', 1996, (New York: Oxford University Press)</span>
				<span class='text'>ISBN 0-19-288052-7&lt;/ref&gt;In continued violence, at least 14 civilians were killed and more than 600 injured from 11–13 January 1991 in Vilnius, Lithuania</span>
				<span class='text'>News of support for Lithuanians from Western governments began to appear</span>
				<span class='text'>The strong Western reaction and actions of Russian democratic forces put the Soviet president and government into an awkward position</span>
				<span class='text'>Further problems surfaced in [[Riga]], Latvia, on 20 and 21 January, where OMON (special Ministry of the Interior troops) killed 4 people</span>
				<span class='text'>Archie Brown suggests that Gorbachev's response this time was better, condemning the rogue action, sending his condolences and suggesting that secession could take place if it went through the procedures outlined in the Soviet constitution</span>
				<span class='text'>According to Gorbachev's aide, Shakhnazarov, Gorbachev was finally beginning to accept the inevitability of &quot;losing&quot; the Baltic republics, although he would try all political means to preserve the Union</span>
				<span class='text'>Brown believes that this put him in &quot;imminent danger&quot; of being overthrown by hard-liners opposing secession</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;Gorbachev thus continued to draw up a new treaty of union which would have created a truly voluntary federation in an increasingly democratised Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>The new treaty was strongly supported by the Central Asian republics, who needed the economic power and markets of the Soviet Union to prosper</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the more radical reformists, such as Russian SFSR President Boris Yeltsin, were increasingly convinced that a rapid transition to a market economy was required and were more than happy to contemplate the disintegration of the Soviet Union if that was required to achieve their aims</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, a referendum on the future of the Soviet Union was held in March (with a referendum in Russia on the creation of a presidency), which returned an average of 76</span>
				<span class='text'>% in the nine republics where it was taken, with a turnout of 80% of the adult population</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Armenia, Georgia and Moldova did not participate</span>
				<span class='text'>Following this, an April meeting at [[Novo-Ogarevo]] between Gorbachev and the heads of the nine republics issued a statement on speeding up the creation of a new Union treaty</span>
				<span class='text'>n May, a hardline newspaper published “[[Architect amidst the Ruins]]”, an [[open letter]] criticizing Yakovlev (often referred to as the &quot;architect of ''perestroika''&quot;) which was signed by [[Gennady Zyuganov]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Many also saw this publication as the start of a campaign to oust Gorbachev</span>
				<span class='text'>eanwhile, on 12 June 1991 Boris Yeltsin was elected [[President of the Russian Federation]] by 57</span>
				<span class='text'>% of the vote (with a turnout of 74%)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;=====Coup of August 1991====={{Main|1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt}}In contrast to the reformers' moderate approach to the new treaty, the hard-line [[apparatchik]]s, still strong within the CPSU and military establishment, completely opposed anything which might lead to the break-up of the Soviet Union</span>
				<span class='text'>On the eve of the treaty's signing, hardline Soviet leaders, calling themselves the '[[State Committee on the State of Emergency]]', launched the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August coup]] in 1991 in an attempt to remove Gorbachev from power and prevent the signing of the new union treaty</span>
				<span class='text'>Under the pretense that Gorbachev was ill, his vice president, Yanayev, took over as president</span>
				<span class='text'> Gorbachev spent three days (19, 20, and 21 August) under house arrest at his [[dacha]] in the [[Crimea]] before being freed and restored to power</span>
				<span class='text'>However, upon his return, Gorbachev found that neither union nor Russian power structures heeded his commands as support had swung over to Yeltsin, whose defiance had led to the coup's collapse</span>
				<span class='text'>urthermore, Gorbachev was forced to fire large numbers of his Politburo and, in several cases, arrest them</span>
				<span class='text'>Those arrested for high treason included the &quot;[[Gang of Eight (Soviet Union)|Gang of Eight]]&quot; that had led the coup, including [[Vladimir Kryuchkov|Kryuchkov]], [[Dmitriy Yazov|Yazov]], [[Valentin Pavlov|Pavlov]] and Yanayev</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Boris Pugo|Pugo]] was found shot; and [[Sergei Akhromeyev|Akhromeyev]], who had offered his assistance but was never implicated, was found hanging in his Kremlin office</span>
				<span class='text'>Most of these men had been former allies of Gorbachev's or promoted by him, which drew fresh criticism</span>
				<span class='text'>====Final collapse=====For all intents and purposes, the coup destroyed Gorbachev politically</span>
				<span class='text'>On 24 August, he advised the Central Committee to dissolve, resigned as General Secretary and dissolved all party units within the government</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly afterward, the Supreme Soviet suspended all Party activities on Soviet territory</span>
				<span class='text'>In effect, Communist rule in the Soviet Union had ended—thus eliminating the only unifying force left in the country</span>
				<span class='text'>orbachev's hopes of a new Union were further hit when the Congress of People's Deputies dissolved itself on 5 September</span>
				<span class='text'>Though Gorbachev and the representatives of eight republics (excluding Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia) signed an agreement on forming a new economic community on 18 October, events were overtaking him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Memoirs /&gt; The Soviet Union collapsed with dramatic speed during the latter part of 1991, as one republic after another declared independence</span>
				<span class='text'>By the autumn, Gorbachev could no longer influence events outside Moscow, and he was challenged even there by Yeltsin</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the coup, Yeltsin suspended all CPSU activities on Russian territory and closed the [[Central Committee]] building at [[Staraya Square]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also ordered the [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]] raised alongside the Soviet flag at the [[Kremlin]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the waning months of 1991, Russia began taking over what remained of the Soviet government, including the Kremlin</span>
				<span class='text'>ith the country in a state of near collapse, Gorbachev's vision of a renewed union effectively received a fatal blow by a [[Ukrainian independence referendum, 1991|Ukrainian referendum]] on 1 December, where the Ukrainian people overwhelmingly voted for independence</span>
				<span class='text'>Ukraine had been the second most powerful republic in the Soviet Union after Russia, and its secession ended any realistic chance of the Soviet Union staying united even on a limited scale</span>
				<span class='text'>The presidents of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus met in [[Belovezh Forest]], near [[Brest, Belarus]], on 8 December and signed the [[Belavezha Accords]], which declared the Soviet Union had ceased to exist and formed the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] as its successor</span>
				<span class='text'>Gorbachev initially denounced this move as illegal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Memoirs /&gt;However, on 12 December, the RSFSR Supreme Soviet ratified the Belevezha Accords and denounced the 1922 Union Treaty</span>
				<span class='text'>It was now apparent that the momentum towards dissolution could not be stopped</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly after the RSFSR ratified the Accords, Gorbachev hinted that he was considering stepping aside</span>
