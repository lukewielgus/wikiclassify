				<span class='text'>395), was [[bishop]] of [[Nyssa (Cappadocia)|Nyssa]] from 372 to 376 and from 378 until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>He is venerated as a [[saint]] in [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], [[Lutheranism]], and [[Anglicanism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory, his elder brother [[Basil of Caesarea]], and their friend [[Gregory of Nazianzus]] are collectively known as the [[Cappadocian Fathers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>regory lacked the administrative ability of his brother Basil or the contemporary influence of Gregory of Nazianzus, but he was an erudite [[theology|theologian]] who made significant contributions to the [[Trinity|doctrine of the Trinity]] and the [[Nicene Creed]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory's philosophical writings were influenced by [[Origen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Since the mid-twentieth century, there has been a significant increase in interest in Gregory's works from the academic community, particularly involving [[Christian Universalism|universal salvation]], which has resulted in challenges to many traditional interpretations of his theology</span>
				<span class='text'>=Background==In the [[book of Acts]], it depicts that at on the Day of [[Pentecost]], that there were visiting Jews who were &quot;residents of</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>appadocia&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Book of Acts, 2:9&lt;/ref&gt; in attendance</span>
				<span class='text'>In the [[First Epistle of Peter]], written after AD 65, the author greets Christians who are &quot;exiles scattered throughout‚Ä¶Cappodicia</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; There is no further reference to Cappadocia in the rest of the New Testament</span>
				<span class='text'>hristianity arose in Cappadocia relatively late with no evidence of a Christian community before the late second century AD</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;vd1&quot;&gt;Van Dam 2003, p</span>
				<span class='text'>1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander of Jerusalem]] was the first bishop of the province in the early to mid third century, a period in which Christians suffered persecution from the local Roman authorities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;vd1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BRILL127&quot;&gt;Mateo Seco &amp; Maspero, p</span>
				<span class='text'>127&lt;/ref&gt; The community remained very small throughout the third century: when [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]] acceded to the bishopric in c</span>
				<span class='text'>250, according to his namesake, the Nyssen, there were only seventeen members of the Church in Caesarea</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Watt &amp; Drijvers, p</span>
				<span class='text'>99&lt;/ref&gt;Cappadocian bishops were among those at the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Because of the broad distribution of the population, rural bishops [œáœâœÅŒµœÄŒπœÉŒ∫ŒøœÄŒøŒπ] were appointed to support the [[Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia|Bishop of Caesarea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>During the late fourth century there were around fifty of them</span>
				<span class='text'>In Gregory's lifetime, the Christians of Cappadocia were devout, with the cults of the [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste]] and [[Saint George]] being particularly significant and represented by a considerable monastic presence</span>
				<span class='text'>There were some adherents of heretical branches of Christianity, most notably Arians, [[Encratites]] and [[Euchites|Messalians]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=BRILL127-8&gt;Mateo Seco &amp; Maspero, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>127-8&lt;/ref&gt;==Biography===== Early life and education ===Gregory was born around 335, probably in or near the city of [[Neocaesarea]], [[Pontus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-103&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>103&lt;/ref&gt; His family was aristocratic and Christian - according to [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], his mother was [[Emmelia of Caesarea]], and his father, a rhetorician, has been identified either as [[Basil the Elder]] or as a Gregory</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-103/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Dam (2003), p</span>
				<span class='text'>77&lt;/ref&gt; Among his nine siblings were [[Macrina the Younger|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Macrina the Younger]], [[Naucratius|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Naucratius]], [[Peter of Sebaste|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Peter of Sebaste]] and [[Basil of Caesarea|St</span>
				<span class='text'>Basil of Caesarea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The precise number of children in the family was historically contentious: the commentary on 30 May in the ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]'', for example, initially states that they were nine, before describing Peter as the tenth child</span>
				<span class='text'>It has been established that this confusion occurred due to the death of one son in infancy, leading to ambiguities in Gregory's own writings</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Pfister (1964), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>108, 113&lt;/ref&gt;  Gregory's parents had suffered persecution for their faith: he writes that they &quot;had their goods confiscated for confessing Christ</span>

				<span class='text'> [[The Life of St</span>
				<span class='text'>Macrina]], (London: SPCK, 1916)&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory's maternal grandmother, [[Macrina the Elder]] is also revered as a saint&lt;ref name=Brill-104&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>104&lt;/ref&gt; and his maternal grandfather was a martyr as Gregory put it &quot;killed by Imperial wrath&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowther Clarke 1916&quot;/&gt; under the persecution of the Roman [[Maximinus II|Emperor Maximinus II]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Gregory Nazianzen, Oration, 43</span>
				<span class='text'>-6&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 320's to the early 340's the family rebuilt its fortunes, with Gregory's father working in the city of Neocaeaseria as an advocate and rhetorician</span>

				<span class='text'>3</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Gregory's temperament is said to be quiet and meek, in contrast to his brother Basil who was known to be much more outspoken</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gonz√°lez|1984|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;Gregory was first educated at home, by his mother Emmelia and sister Macrina</span>
				<span class='text'>Little is known of what further education he received</span>
				<span class='text'>Apocryphal hagiographies depict him studying at [[Athens]], but this is speculation probably based on the life of his brother Basil</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Drijvers-120&gt;Watt &amp; Drijvers, p</span>
				<span class='text'>120&lt;/ref&gt; It seems more likely that he continued his studies in [[Kayseri|Caesarea]], where he read [[classical literature]], [[philosophy]] and perhaps [[medicine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-105&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>105&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory himself claimed that his only teachers were Basil, &quot;Paul, John and the rest of the Apostles and prophets&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ludlow 2000, p</span>
				<span class='text'>21&lt;/ref&gt;While his brothers Basil and Naucratius lived as [[hermit]]s from c</span>
				<span class='text'>355, Gregory initially pursued a non-ecclesiastical career as a [[rhetorician]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He did however, act as a [[Reader (liturgy)|lector]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-105 /&gt; He is known to have married a woman named Theosebia during this period, who is sometimes identified with [[Theosebia|Theosebia the Deaconess]], venerated as a saint by Orthodox Christianity</span>
				<span class='text'>This is controversial, however, and other commentators suggest that Theosebia the Deaconess was one of Gregory's sisters</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Dani√©lou, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;73‚Äì76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brill-106&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>06&lt;/ref&gt;=== Episcopate ===In 371, the [[Roman emperor|Emperor]] [[Valens]] split Cappadocia into two new provinces, Cappadocia Prima and Cappadocia Secunda</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Van Dam, p</span>
				<span class='text'>77&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in complex changes in ecclesiastical boundaries, during which several new bishoprics were created</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory was elected bishop of the new [[Episcopal see|see]] of [[Nyssa (Cappadocia)|Nyssa]] in 372, presumably with the support of his brother Basil, who was [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[Caesarea Mazaca|Caesarea]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-107&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>107&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory's early policies as bishop often went against those of Basil : for instance, while his brother condemned the [[Sabellianism|Sabellianist]] followers of [[Marcellus of Ancyra]] as [[heresy|heretics]], Gregory may have tried to reconcile them with the church</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-107 /&gt;Gregory faced opposition to his reign in Nyssa, and, in 373 [[Amphilochius of Iconium|Amphilochius]], bishop of [[Konya|Iconium]] had to visit the city to quell discontent</span>
				<span class='text'>In 375 Desmothenes of Pontus convened a [[synod]] at [[Ancyra]] to try Gregory on charges of [[embezzlement]] of church funds and irregular ordination of bishops</span>
				<span class='text'>He was arrested by imperial troops in the winter of the same year, but escaped to an unknown location</span>
				<span class='text'>The synod of Nyssa, which was convened in the spring of 376, deposed him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-108&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>108&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gregory regained his see in 378, perhaps due to an amnesty promulgated by the new emperor [[Gratian]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the same year Basil died, and despite the relative unimportance of Nyssa, Gregory took over many of his brother's former responsibilities in Pontus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-109&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>109&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Council of Constantinople 381-stavropoleos church</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|left|The First Council of Constantinople, as depicted in a [[fresco]] in the [[Stavropoleos Monastery]], [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]He was present at the [[Synods of Antioch|Synod]] of [[Antioch]] in April 379, where he unsuccessfully attempted to reconcile the followers of [[Meletius of Antioch]] with those of [[Paulinus, Bishop of Antioch|Paulinus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-110&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>110&lt;/ref&gt;After visiting the village of Annisa to see his dying sister Macrina, he returned to Nyssa in August</span>
				<span class='text'>In 380 he travelled to [[Sivas|Sebaste]], in the province of [[Armenia Prima]], to support a pro-Nicene candidate for the election to the bishopric</span>
				<span class='text'>To his surprise, he himself was elected to the seat, perhaps due to the population's association of him with his brother</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-111&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>111&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gregory deeply disliked the relatively unhellenized society of Armenia, and he was confronted by an investigation into his orthodoxy by local opponents of the Nicene theology</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-111 /&gt; After a stay of several months, a substitute was found - possibly Gregory's brother Peter, who was bishop of Sebaste from 381 - and Gregory returned home to Nyssa to write books I and II of ''Against [[Eunomius of Cyzicus|Eunomius]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-111 /&gt;Gregory participated in the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (381), and perhaps gave there his famous sermon ''In suam ordinationem''</span>
				<span class='text'>He was chosen to [[Eulogy|eulogise]] at the funeral of Melitus, which occurred during the council</span>
				<span class='text'>The council sent Gregory on a mission to Arabia, perhaps to ameliorate the situation in [[Bostra]], where two men, Agapius and Badagius, claimed to be bishop</span>
				<span class='text'>If this is the case, Gregory was unsuccessful, as the see was still contested in 394</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-111 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brill-112&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>112&lt;/ref&gt; He then travelled to [[Jerusalem]], where [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] faced opposition from local clergy due to the fact that he had been ordained by [[Acacius of Caesarea]], an [[Arian]] heretic</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory's attempted mediation of the dispute was unsuccessful, and he himself was accused of holding unorthodox [[Christology|views on the nature of Christ]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-112 /&gt; His later reign in Nyssa was marked by conflict with his Metropolitan, Helladius</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory was present at a 394 synod convened at Constantinople to discuss the continued problems in Bostra</span>
				<span class='text'>The year of his death is unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-114&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>114&lt;/ref&gt;== Theology ==The traditional view of Gregory is that he was an orthodox [[trinity|Trinitarian theologian]], who was influenced by the [[neoplatonism]] of [[Plotinus]] and believed in [[Christian universalism|universal salvation]] following [[Origen]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;For example, see {{cite book|last=Knight|first=George T</span>
				<span class='text'>title=[[Schaff‚ÄìHerzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge]]|year=1908‚Äì14|publisher=Funk and Wagnalls|location=London and New York|pages=96‚Äì8|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a highly original and sophisticated thinker, Gregory is difficult to classify, and many aspects of his theology are contentious among both conservative [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] theologians and Western academic scholarship</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Coakley&gt;Coakley et al</span>
				<span class='text'> pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;1‚Äì14&lt;/ref&gt; This is often due to the lack of systematic structure and the presence of terminological inconsistencies in Gregory's work</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = SDOT&gt;Davis et al</span>
				<span class='text'> p</span>
				<span class='text'>14&lt;/ref&gt;===Conception of the Trinity===Gregory, following Basil, defined the Trinity as &quot;one essence &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[ousia|Œø·ΩêœÉŒØŒ±]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; in three persons &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Hypostasis (philosophy)|·ΩëœÄŒøœÉœÑŒ¨œÉŒµŒπœÇ]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;, the formula adopted by the Council of Constantinople in 381</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Larson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>42&lt;/ref&gt; Like the other Cappadocian Fathers, he was a [[homoousian]], and ''Against Eunomius'' affirms the truth of the [[consubstantiality]] of the trinity over Eunomius' Aristotelian belief that the Father's substance is unengendered, whereas the Son's is engendered</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-750&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>750&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gregory, the differences between the three persons of the Trinity reside in their relationships with each other, and the triune nature of God is revealed through divine action (despite the unity of God in His action)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-751&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>751&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jenson, pp</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;105‚Äì6&lt;/ref&gt; The Son is therefore defined as begotten of the Father, the Holy Spirit as proceeding from the Father and the Son, and the Father by his role as progenitor</span>
				<span class='text'>However, this doctrine would seem to [[subordinationism|subordinate]] the Son to the Father, and the Holy Spirit to the Son</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Robert Jenson]] suggests that Gregory implies that each member of the [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]] has an individual priority: the Son has [[epistemology|epistemological priority]], the Father has [[ontology|ontic priority]] and the Spirit has [[metaphysics|metaphysical priority]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Jenson, p</span>
				<span class='text'>167&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators disagree: Morwenna Ludlow, for instance, argues that epistemic priority resides primarily in the Spirit in Gregory's theology</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name = Ludlow&gt;Ludlow 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>43&lt;/ref&gt;Modern proponents of [[social trinity|social Trinitarianism]] often claim to have been influenced by the Cappadocians' dynamic picture of the Trinity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Ludlow 2007, p</span>
				<span class='text'>51&lt;/ref&gt; However, it would be fundamentally incorrect to identify Gregory as a social Trinitarian, as his theology emphasises the unity of God's will, and he clearly believes that the [[Identity (philosophy)|identities]] of the Trinity are the three persons, not the relations between them</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=SDOT /&gt;&lt;ref name = Ludlow /&gt;===Infinitude of God===[[File:St</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory of Nyssa</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|11th century [[mosaic]] of Gregory of Nyssa</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Saint Sophia's Cathedral, Kiev|Saint Sophia Cathedral]] in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]</span>
				<span class='text'>]Gregory was one of the first theologians to argue, in opposition to [[Origen]], that God is [[infinity|infinite]]</span>
				<span class='text'>His main argument for the infinity of God, which can be found in ''Against Eunomius'', is that God's goodness is limitless, and as God's goodness is [[essence|essential]], God is also limitless</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-424&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>424&lt;/ref&gt;An important consequence of Gregory's belief in the infinity of God is his belief that God, as limitless, is essentially incomprehensible to the limited minds of created beings</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''Life of Moses'', Gregory writes: &quot;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>very concept that comes from some comprehensible image, by an approximate understanding and by guessing at the Divine nature, constitutes a idol of God and does not proclaim God</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;The life of Moses / Gregory of Nyssa ; translation, introd</span>
				<span class='text'>and notes by Abraham J</span>
				<span class='text'>Malherbe and Everett Ferguson ; pref</span>
				<span class='text'>by John Meyendorff Page 81&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory's theology was thus [[apophatic theology|apophatic]]: he proposed that God should be defined in terms of what we know He is not rather than what we might speculate Him to be</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-68&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>68&lt;/ref&gt;Accordingly, the Nyssen taught that due to God's infinitude, a created being can never reach an understanding of God, and thus for man in both life and the afterlife there is a [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|constant progression]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;·ºêœÄŒ≠Œ∫œÑŒ±œÉŒπœÇ&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; towards the unreachable knowledge of God, as the individual continually transcends all which has been reached before</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-425&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>425&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Life of Moses'', Gregory speaks of three stages of this spiritual growth: initial darkness of [[ignorance]], then spiritual [[Light (theology)|illumination]], and finally a darkness of the mind in mystic [[theoria|contemplation]] of the God who cannot be comprehended</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-522&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>522&lt;/ref&gt;===Universalism===Gregory seems to have believed in the universal salvation of all human beings</span>
				<span class='text'>Gregory argues that when Paul says that God will be &quot;all in all&quot; (1 Cor</span>
				<span class='text'>15:28), this means that though some may need long time of purification, eventually &quot;no being will remain outside the number of the saved&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In Illud 17; 21 (Downing)&lt;/ref&gt; and that &quot;no being created by God will fall outside the Kingdom of God&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;In Illud 14 (Downing)&lt;/ref&gt;  Gregory also described God's work this way: &quot;His [God's] end is one, and one only; it is this: when the complete whole of our race shall have been perfected from the first man to the last‚Äîsome having at once in this life been cleansed from evil, others having afterwards in the necessary periods been healed by the Fire, others having in their life here been unconscious equally of good and of evil‚Äîto offer to every one of us participation in the blessings which are in Him, which, the Scripture tells us, 'eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,' nor thought ever reached</span>

				<span class='text'>57&lt;/ref&gt; This salvation may not only extend to humans; following [[Origen]], there are passages where he seems to suggest (albeit through the voice of Macrina) that even the [[demon]]s will have a place in Christ's &quot;world of goodness&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name= Ludlow-80&gt;Ludlow 2000, p</span>
				<span class='text'>80&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory's interpretations of {{Bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:28|KJV}} (&quot;And when all things shall be subdued unto him&amp;nbsp;</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>quot;) and {{Bibleverse||Philippians|2:10|KJV}} (&quot;That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth&quot;) support this understanding of his theology</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name= Ludlow-80/&gt;However, in the ''Great Catechism'', Gregory suggests that while every human will be [[resurrection|resurrected]], salvation will only be accorded to the [[baptism|baptised]], although he also states that others driven by their passions can be saved after being purified by fire</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>56-57&lt;/ref&gt; While he believes that there will be no more evil in the hereafter, it is arguable that this does not preclude a belief that God might justly damn sinners for eternity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-59&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>59&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the main difference between Gregory's conception of ·ºÄœÄŒøŒ∫Œ±œÑŒ¨œÉœÑŒ±œÉŒπœÇ and that of Origen would be that Gregory believes that mankind will be collectively returned to sinlessness, whereas Origen believes that personal salvation will be universal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-59/&gt; This interpretation of Gregory has been criticized recently, however</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ilaria Ramelli 2013 pp</span>
				<span class='text'>433-4&quot;&gt;Ilaria Ramelli: The Christian Doctrine of Apokatastasis (Brill 2013), pp</span>
				<span class='text'>433-4&lt;/ref&gt;Attempting to reconcile these disparate positions, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] theologian Mario Baghos notes that &quot;when taken at face value the saint seems to be contradicting himself in these passages; on the one hand he asserted the salvation of all and the complete eradication of evil, and, on the other, that the fire needed to purge evil is ‚Äòsleepless‚Äô, i</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>everlasting</span>
				<span class='text'>The only solution to this inconsistency is to view any allusion to universal salvation in St Gregory as an expression of God‚Äôs intention for humanity, which is in fact attested to when his holy sister states that God has ‚Äúone goal [‚Ä¶] some straightway even in this life purified from evil, others healed hereafter through fire for the appropriate length of time</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ilaria Ramelli 2013 pp</span>
				<span class='text'>433-4&quot;/&gt;===Anthropology===Gregory's [[Christian anthropology|anthropology]] is founded on the ontological distinction between the [[Ex nihilo|created]] and uncreated</span>
				<span class='text'>Man is a material creation, and thus limited, but infinite in that his [[immortal soul]] has an indefinite capacity to grow closer to the divine</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>38&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory believed that the soul is created simultaneous to the creation of the body (in opposition to Origen, who believed in [[preexistence]]), and that [[embryo]]s were thus persons</span>
				<span class='text'>To Gregory, the human being is exceptional, being created in the [[image of God]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>39&lt;/ref&gt; Humanity is [[Theomorphism|theomorphic]]  both in having self-awareness and [[free will]], the latter which gives each individual existential power, because to Gregory, in disregarding God one negates one's own existence</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>41&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Song of Songs'', Gregory metaphorically describes human lives as paintings created by apprentices to a master: the apprentices (the human wills) imitate their master's work (the life of Christ) with beautiful colors ([[virtues]]), and thus man strives to be a reflection of Christ</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-42&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>42&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory, in stark contrast to most thinkers of his age, saw great beauty in [[Fall of Man|the Fall]]: from Adam's sin from two perfect humans would eventually arise myriad</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Brill-42/&gt;Gregory was also one of the first Christian voices to say that slavery as an institution was inherently sinful</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; He believed that slavery violated mankind's inherent worth, and the nature of humanity to be free; a departure from classical, and Judeo-Christian precedent which he rooted in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], arguing that man was given mastery of animals but not of mankind</span>
				<span class='text'>Although aspects of the slave system had been criticized by Stoics such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], this was the first and only sustained critique of the institution of slavery itself made in the ancient world</span>

How many obols did you reckon the equivalent of the likeness of God? How many staters did you get for selling that being shaped by God? God said, Let us make man in our own image and likeness</span>
				<span class='text'>If he is in the likeness of God, and rules the whole earth, and has been granted authority over everything on earth from God, who is his buyer, tell me? Who is his seller? To God alone belongs this power; or, rather, not even to God himself</span>
				<span class='text'>For his gracious gifts, it says, are irrevocable</span>
				<span class='text'>God would not therefore reduce the human race to slavery, since he himself, when we had been enslaved to sin, spontaneously recalled us to freedom</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Neoplatonism===There are many similarities between Gregory's theology and [[neoplatonism|neoplatonist]] philosophy, especially that of Plotinus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The perennial tradition of Neoplatonism, p</span>
				<span class='text'>188&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, they share the idea that the reality of God is completely inaccessible to human beings and that man can only come to see God through a spiritual journey in which knowledge &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[gnosis|Œ≥ŒΩ·ø∂œÉŒπœÇ]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is rejected in favour of meditation</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;The perennial tradition of Neoplatonism, p</span>
				<span class='text'>amp;nbsp;188‚Äì94&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory does not refer to any neoplatonist philosophers in his work, and there is only one disputed passage which may directly quote Plotinus</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>531&lt;/ref&gt; Considering this, it seems possible that Gregory was familiar with Plotinus and perhaps other figures in neoplatonism</span>
				<span class='text'>However, some significant differences between neoplatonism and Gregory's thought exist, such as Gregory's statement that beauty and goodness are equivalent, which contrasts with Plotinus' view that they are two different qualities</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Maspero &amp; Mateo Seco, p</span>
				<span class='text'>532&lt;/ref&gt;[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] theologians are generally critical of the theory that Gregory was influenced by neoplatonism</span>
				<span class='text'>For example, [[Hierotheos (Vlachos)|Metropolitan Hierotheos of Nafpaktos]] argues in ''Life After Death'' that Gregory opposed all philosophical (as opposed to theological) endeavour as tainted with worldliness</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Life after Death, ch</span>
				<span class='text'>8&lt;/ref&gt; This view is supported by ''Against Euthonius'', where Gregory denounces Euthonius for placing the results of his systematic [[Aristotle|Aristotelean]] philosophy above the traditional teachings of the Church</span>

				<span class='text'>70&lt;/ref&gt; In part due to the scholarship of Balthasar and [[Jean Dani√©lou]], by the 1950s Gregory became the subject of much serious theological research, with a critical edition of his work published (''Gregorii Nysseni Opera''), and the founding of the International Colloquium on Gregory of Nyssa</span>

				<span class='text'>His outlook surpassed not only St</span>
