				<span class='text'> He also was an owner of the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]]</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;[[Alexander's Ragtime Band]]&quot; sparked an international dance craze in places as far away as Berlin's native Russia, which also &quot;flung itself into the ragtime beat with an abandon bordering on mania</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Over the years he was known for writing music and lyrics in the American vernacular: uncomplicated, simple and direct, with his stated aim being to &quot;reach the heart of the average American,&quot; whom he saw as the &quot;real soul of the country</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt; In doing so, said [[Walter Cronkite]], at Berlin's 100th birthday tribute, he &quot;helped write the story of this country, capturing the best of who we are and the dreams that shape our lives</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=NYT-87/&gt;==Early life=====Russian immigrant=======Life in Russia====Berlin was born on May 11, 1888, one of eight children of Moses and Lena Lipkin Beilin</span>
				<span class='text'> There are several possibilities concerning his birth city</span>
				<span class='text'>His daughter, Mary Ellin Barrett, states it was in [[Tyumen]], [[Siberia]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Other sources list one of several villages near the city of [[Mogilyov]], [[Russian Empire]] (now Belarus)</span>
				<span class='text'>His father, a [[Hazzan|cantor]] in a [[synagogue]], uprooted the family to America, as did many other Jewish families in the late 19th century</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1893 they settled in New York City</span>
				<span class='text'>As of the 1900 census, the name &quot;Beilin&quot; had changed to &quot;Baline</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; According to his biographer, [[Laurence Bergreen]], as an adult Berlin admitted to no memories of his first five years in Russia except for one: &quot;he was lying on a blanket by the side of a road, watching his house burn to the ground</span>
				<span class='text'>By daylight the house was in ashes</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Bergreen&gt;Bergreen, Laurence</span>
				<span class='text'>''As Thousands Cheer'', Viking Penguin, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}[[Ian Whitcomb]] described Berlin's life in Russia:&lt;blockquote&gt;Life might have seemed irksome to Israel Baline: God was watching you everywhere</span>
				<span class='text'>From the dawn bath to the night straw cot, everything was of religious significance</span>
				<span class='text'>God was in the food and in the clothing</span>
				<span class='text'>When Moses caught Israel pulling on his little shoes in a manner proscribed (forbidden) by the [[Talmud]] he beat him</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The floor of the Baline hut-home was of hard black dirt</span>
				<span class='text'>Outside, the squiggly streets of Tyumen were either mud or dust according to the season</span>
				<span class='text'>Lining the squiggles were horrid wooden huts</span>
				<span class='text'>Sometimes wild pigs would rage into town and bite children to death</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>t was not a setting to sing about</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, cantor Moses took his children to the synagogue where, in soothing sing-song readings from the Talmud, the cares of the day were eased away</span>
				<span class='text'>Life in Tyumen sounds pretty awful but, in later years, Irving Berlin said he was unaware of being raised in abject poverty</span>
				<span class='text'>He knew no other life and there was always hot food on the table, even if it was God-riddled</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Whitcomb also describes further the turning point in Berlin's early life:&lt;blockquote&gt;But, suddenly one day, the [[Cossacks]] rampaged in on a [[pogrom]]</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>they simply burned it to the ground</span>
				<span class='text'>Israel and his family watched from a distant road</span>
				<span class='text'>Israel was wrapped in a warm feather quilt</span>
				<span class='text'>Then they made a hasty exit</span>
				<span class='text'>Knowing that they were breaking the law by leaving without a passport (Russia at that time was the only country requiring passports), the Balines smuggled themselves creepingly from town to town, from satellite to satellite, from sea to shining sea, until finally they reached their star: the [[Statue of Liberty]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He found that if he sang some of the songs while selling papers, people would toss him coins in appreciation, which gave him a vision of things to come</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; Berlin entered a lifestyle along the [[Bowery]] where an entire subindustry of lodging houses had sprung up to shelter the thousands  of homeless boys choking the [[Lower East Side]] streets</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;They were not settlement houses or charitable institutions; rather, they were [[Dickensian]] in their meanness, filth, and insensitivity to ordinary human beings</span>

				<span class='text'>His only ability was acquired from his father's vocation: singing</span>
				<span class='text'>He joined with a few other youngsters and went to saloons on the Bowery to sing to customers</span>
				<span class='text'>These itinerant young singers were common on the Lower East Side</span>
				<span class='text'>He would sing a few of the popular ballads he heard on the street, hoping that customers would &quot;pitch a few pennies in his direction</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; As Bergreen notes, &quot;it was in these seamy surroundings that the runaway boy received his real and lasting education</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Music became his sole source of income and he emerged culturally from the ghetto lifestyle, learning the &quot;language of the street</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;To survive, Berlin began to recognize the kind of songs that appealed to audiences: &quot;well-known tunes expressing simple sentiments were the most reliable</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Bergreen/&gt;{{rp|17}} He began [[Song-plugger|plugging songs]] at [[Tony Pastor]]'s Music Hall in [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] and finally, in 1906 when he was 18, working as a singing waiter at the Pelham Cafe in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]]</span>

				<span class='text'>1911]]Berlin was &quot;flabbergasted&quot; by the sudden international popularity of the song, and began to ask himself &quot;Why? Why?&quot; Berlin later wrote,&lt;blockquote&gt;And I got an answer</span>
				<span class='text'>The melody</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>started the heels and shoulders of all America and a good section of Europe to rocking</span>
				<span class='text'>The lyric, silly though it was, was fundamentally right</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Bergreen/&gt;{{rp|69}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;;&quot;Watch Your Step&quot;Furia writes that the international success of &quot;Alexander's Ragtime Band&quot;  gave [[ragtime]] &quot;new life and sparked a national dance craze</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Two dancers who expressed that craze were Irene and [[Vernon Castle]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1914, Berlin wrote a ragtime revue, &quot;Watch Your Step,&quot; which starred the couple and showcased their talents on stage</span>
				<span class='text'>That musical revue became Berlin's first complete score and Furia notes that &quot;its songs radiated musical and lyrical sophistication</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Berlin's ragtime songs, he adds, had &quot;quickly come to signify [[modernism]], and Berlin caught the cultural struggle between [[Victorian America|Victorian]] gentility and the purveyors of liberation, indulgence, and leisure with songs such as &quot;[[Play a Simple Melody]]&quot;  That particular song, according to Furia, also became the first of his famous &quot;double&quot; songs in which two different melodies and lyrics are [[counterpoint]]ed against one another</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Furia-Poets/&gt;''Variety'' called it &quot;The First Syncopated Musical,&quot; where the &quot;sets and the girls were gorgeous</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; But most of the success or otherwise of the show was riding on the Berlin name, according to Whitcomb</span>
				<span class='text'>He notes that ''Variety''</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> marked the show as a &quot;terrific hit&quot; from opening night alone:&lt;blockquote&gt;Irving Berlin stands out like the Times building does in the Square</span>
				<span class='text'>That youthful marvel of syncopated melody is proving things in 'Watch Your Step', firstly that he is not alone a rag composer, and that he is one of the greatest lyric writers America has ever produced</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Besides rags Berlin wrote a polka that was very pretty, and he intermingled ballads with trots, which, including the grand opera medley, gives [[Watch Your Step (musical)|Watch Your Step]] all the kind of music there is</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Whitcomb/&gt;{{rp|173}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Whitcomb also points out the irony that Russia, the country Berlin's family was forced to leave, flung itself into &quot;the ragtime beat with an abandon bordering on mania&quot;:&lt;blockquote&gt;</span>

				<span class='text'></span>

				<span class='text'>Many of the songs were for the new dances then appearing, such as the &quot;grizzly bear&quot;, &quot;chicken walk&quot;, or fox trot</span>
				<span class='text'>After a Hawaiian dance craze began, he wrote &quot;That Hula-Hula&quot;, and then did a string of southern songs, such as &quot;When the Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>During this period, he was creating a few new songs every week, including numerous rags and songs aimed at the various immigrant cultures arriving from Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Furia tells of a train trip Berlin was on where he decided to entertain the fellow passengers</span>
				<span class='text'>Later on they asked him how he knew so many hit songs, and Berlin would modestly reply, &quot;I wrote them</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Furia-Poets/&gt;{{rp|53}}One of the key songs that Berlin wrote in his transition from ragtime to lyrical ballads was &quot;[[A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody]],&quot; which was considered one of Berlin's &quot;first big guns,&quot; according to historian [[Alec Wilder]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The song was written for [[Ziegfeld]]'s ''Follies of 1919'' and became the musical's leading song</span>
				<span class='text'>Its popularity was so great that it became the theme for all of Ziegfeld's revues, and later the theme song in the 1936 film ''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]'' [http://www</span>

				<span class='text'>om/video/x3ick8_a-pretty-girl-is-like-a-melody-the_shortfilms (Watch)]</span>
				<span class='text'> Wilder puts it &quot;on a level with [[Jerome Kern]]'s &quot;pure melodies,&quot; and in comparison with Berlin's earlier music, finds it &quot;extraordinary that such a development in style and sophistication should have taken place in a single year</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Furia-Poets/&gt;{{rp|53}}{{clear}}====World War I====On April 1, 1917 President [[Woodrow Wilson]] declared that America would enter [[World War I]], and, as Whitcomb writes:{{quote|The beleaguered Allies would be rescued from the evil [[Central Powers]] by a noble American game-plan and a barrel of morals</span>

				<span class='text'>Berlin joined the effort and wrote, &quot;For Your Country and My Country&quot;, adding &quot;we must speak with the sword not the pen to show our appreciation to America for opening up her heart and welcoming every immigrant group</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He then joined with George Meyer and his old colleague [[Edgar Leslie]] in a song that demanded an end to ethnicity: &quot;Let's All Be Americans Now</span>

				<span class='text'>However, the Army only wanted Berlin, now aged 30, to do what he knew best: to write songs of patriotism</span>
				<span class='text'>Hence, while stationed with the [[152nd Depot Brigade]] at [[Camp Upton]], he composed an all-soldier musical revue titled &quot;[[Yip Yip Yaphank]]&quot;, written to be patriotic tribute to the [[United States Army]]</span>
				<span class='text'>By the following summer, the show was taken to Broadway where it also included a number of hits, including &quot;Mandy&quot; and &quot;Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning&quot;, which he performed himself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt; The shows earned $150,000 for a camp service center</span>

				<span class='text'>oosely based on the life of sharpshooter [[Annie Oakley]], the music and lyrics were written by Berlin, with a book by [[Herbert Fields]] and his sister [[Dorothy Fields]]</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=Wilder/&gt;{{rp|94}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Apparently the &quot;creative spurt&quot; in which Berlin turned out several songs for the score in a single weekend was an anomaly</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;You have a natural gift for words and music,&quot; Mr</span>
				<span class='text'>Herbert told him</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;Learning theory might help you a little, but it could cramp your style</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Berlin took his advice</span>
				<span class='text'>Herbert later became a moving force behind the creation of ASCAP, the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1914, Berlin joined him as a charter member of the organization that has protected the royalties of composers and writers ever since</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=NYT-obit/&gt;Years later, he was asked whether he ever studied lyrical writing:&lt;blockquote&gt;I never have, because if I don't know them I do not have to observe any rules and can do as I like, which is much better for me than if I allowed myself to be governed by the rules of versification</span>
				<span class='text'>In following my own method I can make my jingles fit my music or vice versa with no qualms as to their correctness</span>

				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Furia/&gt;{{rp|234}}According to music historian Alec Wilder, it was well known that Berlin, unable to commit his own music to paper, paid a professional musician (referred to as a &quot;musical secretary&quot;) to harmonize and transcribe his music, but always did so under his close supervision</span>
				<span class='text'>He notes that &quot;though Berlin may seldom have played acceptable harmony, he nevertheless, by some mastery of his inner ear, senses it, in fact writes many of his melodies with this natural, intuitive harmonic sense at work in his head, but not in his hands</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=Wilder/&gt;{{rp|93}}As a result, Wilder concludes that many admirers of the music of [[Jerome Kern]], [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Cole Porter]] were unlikely to consider Berlin's work in the same category</span>
				<span class='text'>But he feels that was due primarily to &quot;forgetfulness and confusion,&quot; making them inclined to minimize his talent</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; He adds that whereas the songs of Kern, [[George Gershwin]], [[Richard Rodgers]], [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] and [[Cole Porter]] brought together Afro-American, Latin American, rural pop, and European operetta, Berlin's music &quot;did not strive to be lofty in that way</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; He adds that &quot;The best of it is a simple, exquisitely crafted street song whose diction feels so natural that one scarcely notices the craft</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; He said, &quot;If I were assigned the task of writing an American opera I should not follow the style of the masters, whose melodies can never be surpassed</span>

				<span class='text'> ''Mad'' had published &quot;Sing Along with MAD,&quot; a collection of 57 parodies of songs written by Berlin, [[Cole Porter]], [[Richard Rodgers]] and other prominent composers</span>
				<span class='text'> In each case, readers were advised that the new lyrics could be &quot;sung to the tune of&quot; the originals</span>
				<span class='text'> Berlin was the lead plaintiff in an infringement case that sought $25 million in damages</span>
				<span class='text'> However, the trial court and circuit court both ruled on ''Mad'''s behalf, the latter judge writing, &quot;The fact that defendants' parodies were written in the same meter as plaintiffs' compositions would seem inevitable if the original was to be recognized, but such a justification is not even necessary; we doubt that even so eminent a composer as plaintiff Irving Berlin should be permitted to claim a property interest in iambic pentameter</span>
