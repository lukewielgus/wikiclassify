				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;OnThisDay&quot; /&gt; This first papal trip to Poland uplifted the nation's spirit and sparked the formation of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement in 1980, which later brought freedom and [[human rights]] to his troubled homeland</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Memory&quot; /&gt;Poland's Communist leaders intended to use the pope's visit to show the people that although the pope was Polish it did not alter their capacity to govern, oppress, and distribute the goods of society</span>
				<span class='text'>They also hoped that if the pope abided by the rules they set, that the Polish people would see his example and follow them as well</span>
				<span class='text'>If the pope's visit inspired a riot, the Communist leaders of Poland were prepared to crush the uprising and blame the suffering on the pope</span>

				<span class='text'>&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|&quot;The pope won that struggle by transcending politics</span>
				<span class='text'>His was what [[Joseph Nye]] calls '[[soft power]]' — the power of attraction and repulsion</span>
				<span class='text'>He began with an enormous advantage, and exploited it to the utmost: He headed the one institution that stood for the polar opposite of the Communist way of life that the Polish people hated</span>
				<span class='text'>He was a Pole, but beyond the regime's reach</span>
				<span class='text'>By identifying with him, Poles would have the chance to cleanse themselves of the compromises they had to make to live under the regime</span>
				<span class='text'>And so they came to him by the millions</span>
				<span class='text'>They listened</span>
				<span class='text'>He told them to be good, not to compromise themselves, to stick by one another, to be fearless, and that God is the only source of goodness, the only standard of conduct</span>
				<span class='text'>'Be not afraid,' he said</span>
				<span class='text'>Millions shouted in response, 'We want God! We want God! We want God!' The regime cowered</span>
				<span class='text'>Had the Pope chosen to turn his soft power into the hard variety, the regime might have been drowned in blood</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, the Pope simply led the Polish people to desert their rulers by affirming solidarity with one another</span>
				<span class='text'>The Communists managed to hold on as despots a decade longer</span>
				<span class='text'>But as political leaders, they were finished</span>
				<span class='text'>Visiting his native Poland in 1979, Pope John Paul II struck what turned out to be a mortal blow to its Communist regime, to the Soviet Empire, [and] ultimately to Communism</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Memory&quot; /&gt; These visits reinforced this message and contributed to the collapse of East European Communism that took place between 1989/1990 with the reintroduction of democracy in Poland, and which then spread through Eastern Europe (1990–1991) and South-Eastern Europe (1990–1992)</span>

				<span class='text'>Some key elements of his strategy to &quot;reposition the Catholic Church&quot; were encyclicals such as ''[[Ecclesia de Eucharistia]]'', ''[[Reconciliatio et paenitentia]]'' and ''[[Redemptoris Mater]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>In his ''At the beginning of the new millennium'' (''[[Novo Millennio Ineunte]]''), he emphasised the importance of &quot;starting afresh from Christ&quot;: &quot;No, we shall not be saved by a formula but by a Person</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; In ''The Splendour of the Truth'' (''[[Veritatis Splendor]]''), he emphasised the dependence of man on God and His Law (&quot;Without the Creator, the creature disappears&quot;) and the &quot;dependence of freedom on the truth&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He warned that man &quot;giving himself over to relativism and scepticism, goes off in search of an illusory freedom apart from truth itself&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''[[Fides et Ratio]]'' (''On the Relationship between Faith and Reason'') John Paul promoted a renewed interest in philosophy and an autonomous pursuit of truth in theological matters</span>
				<span class='text'>Drawing on many different sources (such as Thomism), he described the mutually supporting relationship between [[faith and rationality|faith and reason]], and emphasised that theologians should focus on that relationship</span>
				<span class='text'>John Paul II wrote extensively about workers and the [[Catholic social teaching|social doctrine]] of the Church, which he discussed in three encyclicals: ''[[Laborem exercens]]'', ''[[Sollicitudo rei socialis]]'', and ''[[Centesimus annus]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Through his encyclicals and many [[General epistles|Apostolic Letters]] and Exhortations, John Paul II talked about the [[dignity]] of women and the importance of the family for the future of humanity</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Memory&quot; /&gt; Other encyclicals include ''The Gospel of Life'' (''[[Evangelium Vitae]]'') and ''Ut Unum Sint'' (''That They May Be One'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Though critics accused him of inflexibility in explicitly re-asserting Catholic moral teachings against [[abortion]] and [[euthanasia]] that have been in place for well over a thousand years, he urged a more nuanced view of [[Catholic Church and capital punishment|capital punishment]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Memory&quot; /&gt; In his second encyclical ''[[Dives in misericordia]]'' he stressed that [[divine mercy]] is the greatest feature of [[God]], needed especially in modern times</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|During a visit to Germany, 1980]]John Paul II was considered a conservative on [[doctrine]] and issues relating to human [[sexual reproduction]] and the ordination of women</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Spiegel2&quot; /&gt;While the Pope was visiting the United States of America he said, &quot;All human life, from the moments of conception and through all subsequent stages, is sacred</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pope John Paul II Visits the US, 1977 Year in Review&quot; /&gt;A series of 129 lectures given by John Paul II during his Wednesday audiences in Rome between September 1979 and November 1984 were later compiled and published as a single work titled ''[[Theology of the Body]]'', an extended meditation on [[human sexuality]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He extended it to the condemnation of abortion, euthanasia and virtually all [[capital punishment]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot; /&gt; calling them all a part of the &quot;[[culture of life|culture of death]]&quot; that is pervasive in the modern world</span>
				<span class='text'>He campaigned for world debt forgiveness and [[social justice]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Memory&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spiegel2&quot; /&gt; He coined the term &quot;[[social mortgage]]&quot;, which related that all private property had a social dimension, namely, that &quot;the goods of this are originally meant for all</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;article 42, Solicitudo Rei Socialis&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he publicly endorsed the [[Jubilee 2000]] campaign on African [[debt relief]] fronted by Irish rock stars [[Bob Geldof]] and [[Bono]], once famously interrupting a [[U2]] recording session by telephoning the studio and asking to speak to Bono</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Pope phones Bono&quot; /&gt;Pope John Paul II, who was present and very influential at the 1962–65 [[Second Vatican Council]], affirmed the teachings of that Council and did much to implement them</span>
				<span class='text'>Nevertheless, his critics often wished that he would embrace the so-called &quot;progressive&quot; agenda that some hoped would evolve as a result of the Council</span>
				<span class='text'>In fact, the Council did not advocate &quot;progressive&quot; changes in these areas; for example, they still condemned abortion as an unspeakable crime</span>
				<span class='text'>Pope John Paul II continued to declare that contraception, abortion, and homosexual acts were gravely sinful, and, with Joseph Ratzinger (future [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), opposed [[liberation theology]]</span>
				<span class='text'>ollowing the Church's exaltation of the marital act of sexual intercourse between a baptised man and woman within sacramental marriage as proper and exclusive to the [[sacrament]] of marriage, John Paul II believed that it was, in every instance, profaned by contraception, abortion, divorce followed by a 'second' marriage, and by homosexual acts</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1994, John Paul II asserted the Church's lack of authority to ordain women to the priesthood, stating that without such authority ordination is not legitimately compatible with fidelity to Christ</span>
				<span class='text'>This was also deemed a repudiation of calls to break with the constant tradition of the Church by ordaining women to the priesthood</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;VaticanOrdinatio&quot; /&gt; In addition, John Paul II chose not to end the discipline of mandatory priestly celibacy, although in a small number of unusual circumstances, he did allow certain married clergymen of other Christian traditions who later became Catholic to be ordained as Catholic priests</span>
				<span class='text'>== Apartheid in South Africa ===Pope John Paul II was an outspoken opponent of [[apartheid in South Africa]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1985, while visiting the [[Netherlands]], he gave an impassioned speech condemning apartheid at the [[International Court of Justice]], proclaiming that &quot;No system of apartheid or separate development will ever be acceptable as a model for the relations between peoples or races</span>

				<span class='text'>In his 2003 [[apostolic exhortation]] Ecclesia in Europa, John Paul II wrote that he &quot;fully (respected) the secular nature of (European) institutions&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he wanted the EU Constitution to enshrine religious rights, including acknowledging the rights of religious groups to organise freely, recognise the specific identity of each denomination and allow for a &quot;structured dialogue&quot; between each religious community and the EU, and extend across the European Union the legal status enjoyed by religious institutions in individual member states</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;I wish once more to appeal to those drawing up the future European Constitutional Treaty so that it will include a reference to the religion and in particular to the Christian heritage of Europe,&quot; John Paul II said</span>

				<span class='text'>He bluntly criticised the poverty of the country, directly addressing [[Baby Doc]] and his wife, [[Michèle Bennett]] in front of a large crowd of Haitians:&lt;blockquote&gt;Yours is a beautiful country, rich in human resources, but Christians cannot be unaware of the injustice, the excessive inequality, the degradation of the quality of life, the misery, the hunger, the fear suffered by the majority of the people</span>

				<span class='text'>He was the first reigning pope to travel to the [[United Kingdom]], in 1982, where he met [[Queen Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;II]], the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He preached in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] and received [[Robert Runcie]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He said that he was disappointed by the Church of England's decision to [[Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion|ordain women]] and saw it as a step away from unity between the [[Anglican Communion]] and the Catholic Church</span>

				<span class='text'>He says:&lt;blockquote&gt;… it would be helpful to recall … the animist religions which stress ancestor worship</span>
				<span class='text'>It seems that those who practice them are particularly close to Christianity, and among them, the Church's missionaries also find it easier to speak a common language</span>
				<span class='text'>Is there, perhaps, in this veneration of ancestors a kind of preparation for the Christian faith in the Communion of Saints, in which all believers—whether living or dead—form a single community, a single body? […] There is nothing strange, then, that the African and Asian animists would become believers in Christ more easily than followers of the great religions of the Far East</span>

				<span class='text'>To honour the pope, animist religious leaders met him at a Catholic Marian shrine in the forest, much to the pontiff's delight</span>
				<span class='text'>John Paul II proceeded to call for the need for religious tolerance, praised animism, and emphasised common elements between animism and Christianity, saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;Nature, exuberant and splendid in this area of forests and lakes, impregnates spirits and hearts with its mystery and orients them spontaneously toward the mystery of He who is the author of life</span>

				<span class='text'>This was the first time a pope had visited a predominantly Eastern Orthodox country since the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] in 1054</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ukraine&quot; /&gt; The Pope spoke to leaders of the All-Ukrainian Council of Churches and Religious Organisations, pleading for &quot;open, tolerant and honest dialogue&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ukraine&quot; /&gt; About 200 thousand people attended the liturgies celebrated by the Pope in [[Kiev]], and the liturgy in [[Lviv]] gathered nearly one and a half million faithful</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Ukraine&quot; /&gt; Healing divisions between the Catholic and [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox churches]] regarding Latin and [[Byzantine]] traditions was clearly of great personal interest</span>
				<span class='text'>For many years, John Paul II sought to facilitate dialogue and unity stating as early as 1988 in ''Euntes in mundum'', &quot;Europe has two lungs, it will never breathe easily until it uses both of them</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;During his 2001 travels, John Paul&amp;nbsp;II became the first pope to visit Greece in 1291 years</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Macedonian&quot; /&gt; After a private 30-minute meeting, the two spoke publicly</span>
				<span class='text'>Christodoulos read a list of &quot;13 offences&quot; of the Catholic Church against the Eastern Orthodox Church since the Great Schism,&lt;ref name=&quot;Macedonian&quot; /&gt; including the pillaging of [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|Constantinople by crusaders]] in 1204, and bemoaned the lack of apology from the Catholic Church, saying &quot;Until now, there has not been heard a single request for pardon&quot; for the &quot;maniacal crusaders of the 13th century&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Macedonian&quot; /&gt;The Pope responded by saying &quot;For the occasions past and present, when sons and daughters of the Catholic Church have sinned by action or omission against their Orthodox brothers and sisters, may the Lord grant us forgiveness&quot;, to which Christodoulos immediately applauded</span>
				<span class='text'>John Paul&amp;nbsp;II said that the sacking of Constantinople was a source of &quot;profound regret&quot; for Catholics</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot; /&gt; At the centre of the bank's failure was its chairman, [[Roberto Calvi]], and his membership in the illegal [[Masonic Lodge]] [[Propaganda Due]] (aka P2)</span>
				<span class='text'>The Vatican Bank was Banco Ambrosiano's main shareholder, and the death of Pope John Paul I in 1978 is rumoured to be linked to the Ambrosiano scandal</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Salinger2005&quot; /&gt;Calvi, often referred to as &quot;God's Banker&quot;, was also involved the Vatican Bank, [[Istituto per le Opere di Religione]], in his dealings, and was close to Bishop [[Paul Marcinkus]], the bank's chairman</span>
				<span class='text'>Ambrosiano also provided funds for political parties in Italy, and for both the [[Somoza]] dictatorship in Nicaragua and its Sandinista opposition</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salinger2005&quot; /&gt;Calvi used his complex network of overseas banks and companies to move money out of Italy, to inflate share prices, and to arrange massive unsecured loans</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1978, the [[Banca d'Italia|Bank of Italy]] produced a report on Ambrosiano that predicted future disaster</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Salinger2005&quot; /&gt; On 5 June 1982, two weeks before the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, Calvi had written a letter of warning to Pope John Paul II, stating that such a forthcoming event would &quot;provoke a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions in which the Church will suffer the gravest damage&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;TimesOnline&quot; /&gt; On 18 June 1982 Calvi's body was found hanging from scaffolding beneath [[Blackfriars Bridge]] in the financial district of London</span>

				<span class='text'>These issues included demanding a return to the [[Tridentine Mass]]&lt;ref name=&quot;HughHewitt&quot; /&gt; and repudiation of the reforms instituted after the Second Vatican Council, such as the use of the vernacular language in the formerly Latin [[Roman Rite]] Mass, [[ecumenism]], and the principle of [[Freedom of religion|religious liberty]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He also was criticized for allowing and appointing liberal bishops in their sees and thus silently promoting [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|Modernism]], which was firmly condemned as the &quot;synthesis of all heresies&quot; by his predecessor [[Pope Pius X|Pope St</span>

				<span class='text'>When a second 'Day of Prayer for Peace in the World'&lt;ref name=&quot;DayOfPrayer&quot; /&gt; was held, in 2002, it was condemned as confusing the laity and compromising to false religions</span>

				<span class='text'>His call for religious freedom was not always supported; bishops like [[Antônio de Castro Mayer]] promoted [[Religious toleration|religious tolerance]], but at the same time rejected the Vatican II principle of religious liberty as being [[Liberalism|liberalist]] and already condemned by Pope Pius IX in his ''[[Syllabus of Errors|'Syllabus errorum']]'' (1864) and at the [[First Vatican Council]]</span>
