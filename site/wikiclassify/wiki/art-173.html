				<span class='text'>They had two other children: a daughter, [[Elisabeth F√∂rster-Nietzsche]], born in 1846, and a second son, Ludwig Joseph, born in 1848</span>
				<span class='text'>Nietzsche's father died from a brain ailment in 1849; Ludwig Joseph died the next year, at age two</span>
				<span class='text'>The family then moved to [[Naumburg]], where they lived with Nietzsche's maternal grandmother and his father's two unmarried sisters</span>
				<span class='text'>After the death of Nietzsche's grandmother in 1856, the family moved into their own house, now [[Nietzsche-Haus, Naumburg|Nietzsche-Haus]], a museum and Nietzsche study center</span>

				<span class='text'>He also found time to work on poems and musical compositions</span>
				<span class='text'>At Schulpforta, Nietzsche received an important grounding in languages‚ÄîGreek, Latin, Hebrew, and French‚Äîso as to be able to read important [[primary source]]s;&lt;ref&gt;Krell, David Farrell, and Donald L</span>

				<span class='text'>{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=37}}While at Pforta, Nietzsche had a penchant for pursuing subjects that were considered unbecoming</span>

				<span class='text'>Additionally, he became acquainted with [[Ernst Ortlepp]], an eccentric, blasphemous, and often drunken poet who was found dead in a ditch weeks after meeting the young Nietzsche but who may have introduced Nietzsche to the music and writing of [[Richard Wagner]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading Schopenhauer's ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' and later admitted that Schopenhauer was one of the few thinkers whom he respected, dedicating to him the essay &quot;[[s:Schopenhauer as Educator|Schopenhauer as Educator]]&quot; in the ''[[Untimely Meditations (Nietzsche)|Untimely Meditations]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>Nietzsche admired both greatly and, during his time at Basel, he frequently visited Wagner's house in [[Tribschen]] in [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Wagners brought Nietzsche into their most intimate circle and enjoyed the attention he gave to the beginning of the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth Festival]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1870, he gave Cosima Wagner the manuscript of &quot;The Genesis of the Tragic Idea&quot; as a birthday gift</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1872, Nietzsche published his first book, ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>However, his colleagues within his field, including Ritschl, expressed little enthusiasm for the work, in which Nietzsche eschewed the classical philologic method in favor of a more speculative approach</span>
				<span class='text'>In his [[polemic]] ''Philology of the Future'', [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]] dampened the book's reception and increased its notoriety</span>
				<span class='text'>In response, Rohde (then a professor in [[Kiel]]) and Wagner came to Nietzsche's defense</span>
				<span class='text'>Nietzsche remarked freely about the isolation he felt within the philological community and attempted unsuccessfully to transfer to a position in philosophy at Basel instead</span>

				<span class='text'>]In 1873, Nietzsche began to accumulate notes that would be posthumously published as ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Between 1873 and 1876, he published four separate long essays: &quot;David Strauss: the Confessor and the Writer&quot;, &quot;On the Use and Abuse of History for Life&quot;, &quot;Schopenhauer as Educator&quot; and &quot;Richard Wagner in Bayreuth&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>These four later appeared in a collected edition under the title ''[[Untimely Meditations (Nietzsche)|Untimely Meditations]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>The essays shared the orientation of a cultural critique, challenging the developing German culture along lines suggested by Schopenhauer and Wagner</span>
				<span class='text'>During this time, in the circle of the Wagners, Nietzsche met [[Malwida von Meysenbug]] and [[Hans von B√ºlow]], and also began a friendship with [[Paul R√©e]], who in 1876 influenced him into dismissing the pessimism in his early writings</span>
				<span class='text'>However, he was deeply disappointed by the [[Bayreuth Festival]] of 1876, where the banality of the shows and baseness of the public repelled him</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also alienated by Wagner's championing of &quot;German culture&quot;, which Nietzsche felt a contradiction in terms, as well as by Wagner's celebration of his fame among the German public</span>
				<span class='text'>All this contributed to Nietzsche's subsequent decision to distance himself from Wagner</span>
				<span class='text'>ith the publication in 1878 of ''[[Human, All Too Human]]'' (a book of [[aphorisms]] ranging from metaphysics to morality to religion to gender studies), a new style of Nietzsche's work became clear, highly influenced by [[Afrikan Spir]]'s ''Thought and Reality''&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, R√ºdiger (trans</span>

				<span class='text'>Nietzsche's friendship with Deussen and Rohde cooled as well</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1879, after a significant decline in health, Nietzsche had to resign his position at Basel</span>
				<span class='text'>(Since his childhood, various disruptive illnesses had plagued him, including moments of shortsightedness that left him nearly blind, migraine headaches, and violent indigestion</span>
				<span class='text'>The 1868 riding accident and diseases in 1870 may have aggravated these persistent conditions, which continued to affect him through his years at Basel, forcing him to take longer and longer holidays until regular work became impractical</span>
				<span class='text'>===Independent philosopher (1879‚Äì88)==={{anchor|independent philosopher|philosopher}}Living off his pension from Basel and aid from friends, Nietzsche travelled frequently to find climates more conducive to his health and lived until 1889 as an independent author in different cities</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent many summers in [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils Maria]] near [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Moritz]] in Switzerland</span>
				<span class='text'>He spent his winters in the Italian cities of [[Genoa]], [[Rapallo]], and [[Turin]] and the French city of [[Nice]]</span>

				<span class='text'>He is known to have tried using the [[Hansen Writing Ball#Nietzsche's Hansen Writing Ball|Hansen Writing Ball]], a contemporary typewriter device</span>
				<span class='text'>In the end, a past student of his, Heinrich K√∂selitz or [[Heinrich K√∂selitz|Peter Gast]], became a sort of private secretary to Nietzsche</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1876, Gast transcribed the crabbed, nearly illegible handwriting of Nietzsche for the first time with Richard Wagner in Bayreuth</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=221}} He subsequently transcribed and proofread the galleys for almost all of Nietzsche's work from then on</span>
				<span class='text'>On at least one occasion on February 23, 1880, the usually broke Gast received 200 marks from their mutual friend, Paul R√©e</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn |Cate |2005 |p=297}} Gast was one of the very few friends Nietzsche allowed to criticize him</span>
				<span class='text'>In responding most enthusiastically to ''Zarathustra'', Gast did feel it necessary to point out that what were described as &quot;superfluous&quot; people were in fact quite necessary</span>
				<span class='text'>He went on to list the number of people [[Epicurus]], for example, had to rely on even to supply his simple diet of goat cheese</span>

				<span class='text'>Nietzsche stood at the beginning of his most productive period</span>

				<span class='text'>{Sfn |Kaufmann |1974 |p=49}} Nietzsche's relationship with R√©e and Salom√© broke up in the winter of 1882‚Äì83, partially because of intrigues conducted by Elisabeth</span>
				<span class='text'>Amidst renewed bouts of illness, living in near-isolation after a falling out with his mother and sister regarding Salom√©, Nietzsche fled to Rapallo</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he wrote the first part of ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' in only ten days</span>

				<span class='text'>Now, with the new style of ''Zarathustra'', his work became even more alienating and the market received it only to the degree required by politeness</span>
				<span class='text'>Nietzsche recognized this and maintained his solitude, though he often complained about it</span>
				<span class='text'>His books remained largely unsold</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1885, he printed only 40 copies of the fourth part of ''Zarathustra'' and distributed only a fraction of these among close friends, including [[Helene von Druskowitz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1883 he tried and failed to obtain a lecturing post at the [[University of Leipzig]]</span>
				<span class='text'>It was made clear to him that, in view of his attitude towards Christianity and his concept of God, he had become effectively unemployable by any German university</span>
				<span class='text'>The subsequent &quot;feelings of revenge and resentment&quot; embittered him: &quot;And hence my rage since I have grasped in the broadest possible sense what wretched means (the depreciation of my good name, my character, and my aims) ''suffice'' to take from me the trust of, and therewith the possibility of obtaining, pupils</span>

				<span class='text'>he initial form of morality was set by a warrior [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] and other ruling castes of ancient civilizations</span>
				<span class='text'>Aristocratic values of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; coincided with and reflected their relationship to lower castes such as slaves</span>
				<span class='text'>Nietzsche presents this &quot;master morality&quot; as the original system of morality‚Äîperhaps best associated with Homeric Greece</span>
				<span class='text'>To be &quot;good&quot; was to be happy and to have the things related to happiness: wealth, strength, health, power, etc</span>
				<span class='text'>To be &quot;bad&quot; was to be like the slaves over which the aristocracy ruled, poor, weak, sick, pathetic‚Äîan object of pity or disgust rather than hatred</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Slave morality&quot; comes about as a reaction to master-morality</span>
				<span class='text'>Here, value emerges from the contrast between good and evil: good being associated with other-worldliness, charity, piety, restraint, meekness, and submission; and evil seen as worldly, cruel, selfish, wealthy, and aggressive</span>
				<span class='text'>Nietzsche sees slave morality as pessimistic and fearful, values for them serving only to ease the existence for those who suffer from the very same thing</span>
				<span class='text'>He associates slave-morality with the Jewish and Christian traditions, in a way that slave-morality is born out of the [[ressentiment]] of slaves</span>
				<span class='text'>Nietzsche argued that the idea of equality allowed slaves to overcome their own condition without hating themselves</span>
				<span class='text'>And by denying the inherent inequality of people (such as success, strength, beauty or intelligence), slaves acquired a method of escape, namely by generating new values on the basis of rejecting something that was seen as a perceived source of frustration</span>
				<span class='text'>It was used to overcome the slave's own sense of inferiority before the (better-off) masters</span>
				<span class='text'>It does so by making out slave weakness to be a matter of choice, by, e</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> relabeling it as &quot;meekness</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; The &quot;good man&quot; of master morality is precisely the &quot;evil man&quot; of slave morality, while the &quot;bad man&quot; is recast as the &quot;good man</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;Nietzsche sees the slave-morality as a source of the nihilism that has overtaken Europe</span>
				<span class='text'>Modern Europe and Christianity exist in a hypocritical state due to a tension between master and slave morality, both values contradictorily determining, to varying degrees, the values of most Europeans (who are ''[[motley]]'')</span>
				<span class='text'>Nietzsche calls for exceptional people to no longer be ashamed of their uniqueness in the face of a supposed morality-for-all, which he deems to be harmful to the flourishing of exceptional people</span>
				<span class='text'>He cautions, however, that morality, per se, is not bad; it is good for the masses, and should be left to them</span>
				<span class='text'>Exceptional people, on the other hand, should follow their own &quot;inner law</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; A favorite motto of Nietzsche, taken from [[Pindar]], reads: &quot;Become what you are</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;A long standing assumption about Nietzsche is that he preferred master over slave morality</span>
				<span class='text'>However, the Nietzsche scholar [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] rejected this interpretation, writing that Nietzsche's analyses of these two types of morality were only used in a [[descriptive ethics|descriptive]] and historic sense, they were not meant for any kind of acceptance or glorifications</span>

				<span class='text'>On the basis of it, most commentators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Morgan |first=George Allen |title=What Nietzsche Means |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Cambridge, MA, USA |year=1941 |page=36 |isbn=0-8371-7404-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; regard Nietzsche as an [[atheism|atheist]]; others (such as Kaufmann) suggest that this statement reflects a more subtle understanding of divinity</span>
				<span class='text'>Recent developments in modern science and the increasing [[secularization]] of European society had effectively 'killed' the Abrahamic God, who had served as the basis for meaning and value in the West for more than a thousand years</span>
				<span class='text'>The death of God may lead beyond bare perspectivism to outright [[nihilism]], the belief that nothing has any inherent importance and that life lacks purpose</span>
				<span class='text'>Here he states that the Christian moral doctrine provides people with [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]], belief in God (which [[Theodicy|justifies]] the evil in the world) and a basis for [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective knowledge]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In this sense, in constructing a world where objective knowledge is possible, Christianity is an antidote to a primal form of nihilism‚Äîthe despair of meaninglessness</span>
				<span class='text'>As [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] put the problem, &quot;If [[God]] as the suprasensory ground and goal of all reality is dead, if the suprasensory world of the ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory and above it its vitalizing and upbuilding power, then nothing more remains to which man can cling and by which he can orient himself</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{Sfn |Heidegger |p=61}}One such reaction to the loss of meaning is what Nietzsche calls 'passive nihilism', which he recognises in the [[pessimism|pessimistic]] philosophy of [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Schopenhauer's doctrine, which Nietzsche also refers to as [[Western Buddhism#Philosophical interest|Western Buddhism]], advocates separating oneself from will and desires in order to reduce suffering</span>
				<span class='text'>Nietzsche characterises this [[Asceticism|ascetic]] attitude as a &quot;will to nothingness&quot;, whereby life turns away from itself, as there is nothing of value to be found in the world</span>
				<span class='text'>This moving away of all value in the world is characteristic of the nihilist, although in this, the nihilist appears to be inconsistent:&lt;ref&gt;This &quot;will to nothingness&quot; is still a willing of some sort, because it is exactly ''as'' a pessimist that Schopenhauer clings to life</span>
				<span class='text'>See F</span>
				<span class='text'>Nietzsche, ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', III:7&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|A nihilist is a man who judges that the real world ought ''not'' to be, and that the world as it ought to be does not exist</span>
				<span class='text'>According to this view, our existence (action, [[suffering]], willing, feeling) has no meaning: this 'in vain' is the nihilists' pathos‚Äîan inconsistency on the part of the nihilists</span>
				<span class='text'>Friedrich Nietzsche, KSA 12:9 [60]|taken from ''The Will to Power,'' section 585, translated by [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]]}}Nietzsche approaches the problem of nihilism as a deeply personal one, stating that this problem of the modern world is a problem that has &quot;become conscious&quot; in him</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;F</span>
				<span class='text'>Nietzsche, KSA 12:7 [8]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he emphasizes both the danger of nihilism and the possibilities it offers, as seen in his statement that &quot;I praise, I do not reproach, [nihilism's] arrival</span>
				<span class='text'>I believe it is one of the greatest crises, a moment of the deepest self-reflection of humanity</span>
				<span class='text'>Whether man recovers from it, whether he becomes master of this crisis, is a question of his strength!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche, Complete Works Vol</span>
				<span class='text'>13</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; According to Nietzsche, it is only when nihilism is ''overcome'' that a culture can have a true foundation upon which to thrive</span>
				<span class='text'>He wished to hasten its coming only so that he could also hasten its ultimate departure</span>
				<span class='text'>Heidegger interprets the death of God with what he explains as the death of [[metaphysics]]</span>
				<span class='text'>He concludes that metaphysics has reached its potential and that the ultimate fate and downfall of metaphysics was proclaimed with the statement ''God is dead''</span>
				<span class='text'>==Apollonian and Dionysian==={{Main|Apollonian and Dionysian}}The ''Apollonian and Dionysian'' is a philosophical concept, or [[dichotomy]], based on certain features of ancient Greek mythology: [[Apollo]] and [[Dionysus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>While the concept is famously related to ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', poet [[Friedrich H√∂lderlin|H√∂lderlin]] spoke of them before, and [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|Winckelmann]] talked of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>One year before the publication of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', Nietzsche wrote a fragment titled &quot;On Music and Words&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>ietzsche found in classical Athenian tragedy an art form that [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcended]] the pessimism found in the so-called [[wisdom of Silenus]]</span>
				<span class='text'>The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously affirmed life, finding it worth living</span>
				<span class='text'>A main theme in ''The Birth of Tragedy'' was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian &quot;''Kunsttrieben''&quot; (&quot;artistic impulses&quot;) forms dramatic arts, or tragedies</span>
				<span class='text'>He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek tragedians</span>
				<span class='text'>Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity and logic, whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion and ecstasy</span>
				<span class='text'>Nietzsche used these two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and chaos on the other formed principles that were fundamental to the [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]]</span>

				<span class='text'>Elaborating on the conception of [[Hamlet]] as an intellectual who cannot make up his mind, and therefore is a living [[antithesis]] to the man of action, Nietzsche argues that a Dionysian figure possesses knowledge to realize that his actions cannot change the eternal balance of things, and it disgusts him enough not to be able to make any act at all</span>
				<span class='text'>Hamlet falls under this category ‚Äì he has glimpsed the supernatural reality through the Ghost, he has gained true knowledge and knows that no action of his has the power to change this</span>

				<span class='text'>This having to transform into perfection is‚Äîart</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Nietzsche is adamant that the works of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] represent the apex of artistic creation, the true realization of tragedy; it is with [[Euripides]], he states, that tragedy begins its &quot;''Untergang''&quot; (literally &quot;going under&quot;, meaning decline, deterioration, downfall, death, etc</span>

				<span class='text'>Nietzsche objects to Euripides' use of [[Socratic method|Socratic rationalism]] and [[morality]] in his tragedies, claiming that the infusion of [[ethics]] and [[reason]] robs tragedy of its foundation, namely the fragile balance of the Dionysian and Apollonian</span>

				<span class='text'>n ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', Nietzsche proclaims that a table of values hangs above every great person</span>
				<span class='text'>He points out that what is common among different peoples is the act of esteeming, of creating values, even if the values are different from one people to the next</span>
				<span class='text'>Nietzsche asserts that what made people great was not the content of their beliefs, but the act of valuing</span>
				<span class='text'>Thus the values a community strives to articulate are not as important as the collective will to see those values come to pass</span>
				<span class='text'>The willing is more essential than the intrinsic worth of the goal itself, according to Nietzsche</span>

				<span class='text'>{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |p=13}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1882 |p=349}}{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1887 |p=II:12}} As such, according to Nietzsche, the drive for conservation appears as the major motivator of human or animal behavior only in exceptions, as the general condition of life is not one of emergency, of 'struggle for existence'</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888b |loc=Skirmishes of an untimely man, ¬ß14}} More often than not, self-conservation is but a consequence of a creature's will to exert its strength on the outside world</span>
				<span class='text'>n presenting his theory of human behavior, Nietzsche also addressed, and attacked, concepts from philosophies popularly embraced in his days, such as Schopenhauer's notion of an aimless will or that of [[utilitarianism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Utilitarians claim that what moves people is mainly the desire to be happy, to accumulate pleasure in their lives</span>
				<span class='text'>But such a conception of happiness Nietzsche rejected as something limited to, and characteristic of, the bourgeois lifestyle of the English society,&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Leiter]], ''Routledge guide to Nietzsche on morality'', p</span>
				<span class='text'>121&lt;/ref&gt; and instead put forth the idea that happiness is not an aim ''per se''‚Äîit is instead a consequence of a successful pursuit of one's aims, of the overcoming of hurdles to one's actions‚Äîin other words, of the fulfillment of the will</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn |Nietzsche |1888c |loc=¬ß2}}Related to his theory of the will to power, is his speculation, which he did not deem final,{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, ¬ß36}} regarding the reality of the physical world, including inorganic matter‚Äîthat, like man's affections and impulses, the material world is also set by the dynamics of a form of the will to power</span>
				<span class='text'>At the core of his theory is a rejection of ''[[atomism]]''‚Äîthe idea that matter is composed of stable, indivisible units (atoms)</span>
				<span class='text'>Instead, he seems to have accepted the conclusions of [[Ruƒëer Bo≈°koviƒá]], who explained the qualities of matter as a result of an interplay of forces</span>

				<span class='text'>Whitlock, &quot;Roger Boscovich, Benedict de Spinoza and Friedrich Nietzsche: The Untold Story&quot;, ''Nietzsche-Studien'' 25, 1996 p 207</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn |Nietzsche |1886 |loc=I, ¬ß12}} One study of Nietzsche defines his fully developed concept of the will to power as &quot;the element from which derive both the quantitative difference of related forces and the quality that devolves into each force in this relation&quot; revealing the will to power as &quot;the principle of the synthesis of forces</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{Sfn |Deleuze |2006 |p=46}} Of such forces Nietzsche said they could perhaps be viewed as a primitive form of the will</span>
				<span class='text'>Likewise he rejected as a mere interpretation the view that the movement of bodies is ruled by inexorable laws of nature, positing instead that movement was governed by the power relations between bodies and forces</span>

				<span class='text'>It is a purely [[physics|physical]] concept, involving no supernatural [[reincarnation]], but the return of beings in the same bodies</span>
				<span class='text'>The idea of eternal return is first invoked by Nietzsche in a parable in Section 341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'', and also in the chapter &quot;Of the Vision and the Riddle&quot; in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', among other places</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn |Nietzsche |1961 |pp=176‚Äì80}} Nietzsche contemplates the idea as potentially &quot;horrifying and paralyzing&quot;, and says that its burden is the &quot;heaviest weight&quot; imaginable (&quot;''das schwerste Gewicht''&quot;)</span>

				<span class='text'> According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the ''question'' of eternal recurrence‚Äîwhether or not such a thing could possibly be true‚Äîthat is so significant in modern thought: &quot;The way Nietzsche here patterns the first communication of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [of eternal recurrence] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' is at the same time 'the most burdensome thought</span>

				<span class='text'>&quot;(B) My life may recur in exactly identical fashion</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; This second view conditionally asserts cosmology, but fails to capture what Nietzsche refers to in ''The Gay Science'', 341</span>
				<span class='text'>Finally, &quot;(C) If my life were to recur, then it could recur only in identical fashion</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; Nehamas shows that this interpretation exists totally independently of physics and does not presuppose the truth of cosmology</span>
				<span class='text'>Nehamas draws the conclusion that if individuals constitute themselves through their actions, then they can only maintain themselves in their current state by living in a recurrence of past actions (Nehamas 153)</span>

				<span class='text'>Man is something that shall be overcome</span>
				<span class='text'>What have you done to overcome him?</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>All beings so far have created something beyond themselves; and do you want to be the ebb of this great flood, and even go back to the beasts rather than overcome man? What is ape to man? A laughing stock or painful embarrassment</span>
				<span class='text'>And man shall be that to overman: a laughingstock or painful embarrassment</span>
				<span class='text'>You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm</span>
				<span class='text'>Once you were apes, and even now, too, man is more ape than any ape</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>The overman is the meaning of the earth</span>
				<span class='text'>Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Man is a rope, tied between beast and overman‚Äîa rope over an abyss </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>what is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end</span>
				<span class='text'>}Zarathustra contrasts the overman with the [[last man]] of egalitarian modernity (most obvious example being [[democracy]]), an alternative goal which humanity might set for itself</span>
				<span class='text'>The last man is possible only by mankind's having bred an [[Apathy|apathetic]] creature who has no great passion or commitment, who is unable to dream, who merely earns his living and keeps warm</span>
				<span class='text'>This concept appears only in ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', and is presented as a condition that would render the creation of the overman impossible</span>

				<span class='text'>tml |title=Nietzsche and Heidegger}}&lt;/ref&gt;Some have suggested that the notion of eternal return is related to the overman since willing the eternal return of the same is a necessary step if the overman is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or [[asceticism]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values</span>
				<span class='text'>It could seem that the overman, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism</span>
				<span class='text'>Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism</span>
				<span class='text'>One must have the strength of the overman in order to will the eternal recurrence; that is, only the overman will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return</span>
				<span class='text'>This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, not because of any choice they made</span>

				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Russell|2004|pp=693‚Äì97}}Nietzsche's philosophy, while innovative and revolutionary, was indebted to many predecessors</span>
				<span class='text'>While at Basel, Nietzsche offered lecture courses on pre-Platonic philosophers for several years, and the text of this lecture series has been characterized as a &quot;lost link&quot; in the development of his thought</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;In it concepts such as the will to power, the eternal return of the same, the overman, gay science, self-overcoming and so on receive rough, unnamed formulations and are linked to specific pre-Platonics, especially Heraclitus, who emerges as a pre-Platonic Nietzsche</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;{{Sfn|Nietzsche|2001|p=xxxvii}} The [[pre-Socratic]] thinker [[Heraclitus]] was known for the rejection of the concept of [[being]] as a constant and eternal principle of universe, and his embrace of &quot;flux&quot; and incessant change</span>
				<span class='text'>His symbolism of the world as &quot;child play&quot; marked by amoral spontaneity and lack of definite rules was appreciated by Nietzsche</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Roochnik|2004|pp=37‚Äì9}} From his Heraclitean sympathy, Nietzsche was also a vociferous detractor of [[Parmenides]], who opposed Heraclitus and believed all world is a single Being with no change at all</span>
				<span class='text'>{Sfn|Roochnik|2004|p=48}}In his ''Egotism in German Philosophy'', [[George Santayana|Santayana]] claimed that Nietzsche's whole philosophy was a reaction to Schopenhauer</span>
				<span class='text'>Santayana wrote that Nietzsche's work was &quot;an emendation of that of Schopenhauer</span>
				<span class='text'>The will to live would become the will to dominate; pessimism founded on reflection would become optimism founded on courage; the suspense of the will in contemplation would yield to a more biological account of intelligence and taste; finally in the place of pity and asceticism (Schopenhauer's two principles of morals) Nietzsche would set up the duty of asserting the will at all costs and being cruelly but beautifully strong</span>
