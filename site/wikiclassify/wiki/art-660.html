				<span class='text'>ondon was part of the radical literary group &quot;The Crowd&quot; in San Francisco and a passionate advocate of unionization, [[socialism]], and the rights of workers</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stasz|2001|p=14}}: &quot;What supports Flora's naming Chaney as the father of her son are, first, the indisputable fact of their cohabiting at the time of his conception, and second, the absence of any suggestion on the part of her associates that another man could have been responsible</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>[but] unless [[DNA]] evidence is introduced, whether or not William Chaney was the biological father of Jack London cannot be decided</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'> Chaney would, however, be considered by her son and his children as their ancestor</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Flora Wellman was living with Chaney in San Francisco when she became pregnant</span>
				<span class='text'>Whether Wellman and Chaney were legally married is unknown</span>
				<span class='text'>Most [[San Francisco]] civil records were destroyed by the extensive fires that followed the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]]; nobody knows what name appeared on her son's birth certificate</span>
				<span class='text'>Stasz notes that in his memoirs, Chaney refers to London's mother Flora Wellman as having been his &quot;wife&quot;; he also cites an advertisement in which Flora called herself &quot;Florence Wellman Chaney&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>{citation needed|date=October 2010}}According to Flora Wellman's account, as recorded in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' of June 4, 1875, Chaney demanded that she have an [[abortion]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When she refused, he disclaimed responsibility for the child</span>
				<span class='text'>In desperation, she shot herself</span>
				<span class='text'>She was not seriously wounded, but she was temporarily deranged</span>
				<span class='text'>After giving birth, Flora turned the baby over for care to Virginia Prentiss, an African-American woman and former slave</span>
				<span class='text'>She was a major maternal figure throughout London's life</span>
				<span class='text'>Late in 1876, Flora Wellman married John London, a partially disabled [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veteran, and brought her baby John, later known as Jack, to live with the newly married couple</span>
				<span class='text'>The family moved around the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] before settling in [[Oakland]], where London completed public [[grade school]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1897, when he was 21 and a student at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], London searched for and read the newspaper accounts of his mother's [[suicide]] attempt and the name of his biological father</span>
				<span class='text'>He wrote to William Chaney, then living in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Chaney responded that he could not be London's father because he was impotent; he casually asserted that London's mother had relations with other men and averred that she had slandered him when she said he insisted on an abortion</span>
				<span class='text'>Chaney concluded by saying that he was more to be pitied than London</span>
				<span class='text'>{sfn|Kershaw|1999|pp=53–54}} London was devastated by his father's letter; in the months following, he quit school at Berkeley and went to the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Klondike]] during the gold rush boom</span>

				<span class='text'>London was largely self-educated{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1885, London found and read [[Ouida]]'s long [[Victorian era|Victorian]] novel ''Signa''</span>
				<span class='text'>He credited this as the seed of his literary success</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;London, Jack (1917) &quot;Eight Factors of Literary Success&quot;, in ''Labor'' (1994), p</span>
				<span class='text'>512</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;In answer to your question as to the greatest factors of my literary success, I will state that I consider them to be: Vast good luck</span>
				<span class='text'>Good health; good brain; good mental and muscular correlation</span>
				<span class='text'>Poverty</span>
				<span class='text'>Reading Ouida's ''Signa'' at eight years of age</span>
				<span class='text'>The influence of [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ''Philosophy of Style</span>
				<span class='text'>' Because I got started twenty years before the fellows who are trying to start today</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, he went to the [[Oakland Public Library]] and found a sympathetic librarian, [[Ina Coolbrith]], who encouraged his learning</span>
				<span class='text'>(She later became California's first ''[[poet laureate]]'' and an important figure in the San Francisco literary community)</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1889, London began working 12 to 18&amp;nbsp;hours a day at Hickmott's Cannery</span>
				<span class='text'>Seeking a way out, he borrowed money from his foster mother Virginia Prentiss, bought the [[sloop]] ''Razzle-Dazzle'' from an [[oyster pirate]] named French Frank, and became an oyster pirate</span>
				<span class='text'>In his memoir, ''[[John Barleycorn (novel)|John Barleycorn]]'', he claims also to have stolen French Frank's mistress Mamie</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;{{Gutenberg|no=318|name=John Barleycorn '', by Jack London''}} Chapters VII, VIII describe his stealing of Mamie, the &quot;Queen of the Oyster Pirates&quot;: &quot;The Queen asked me to row her ashore in my skiff</span>

				<span class='text'>Evidently Jack believed the myth himself at times</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>Jack met Mamie aboard the Razzle-Dazzle when he first approached French Frank about its purchase</span>
				<span class='text'>Mamie was aboard on a visit with her sister Tess and her chaperone, Miss Hadley</span>
				<span class='text'>It hardly seems likely that someone who required a chaperone on Saturday would move aboard as mistress on Monday</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt; After a few months, his sloop became damaged beyond repair</span>
				<span class='text'>London hired on as a member of the [[California Department of Fish and Wildlife|California Fish Patrol]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1893, he signed on to the [[Seal hunting|sealing]] [[schooner]] ''Sophie Sutherland'', bound for the coast of [[Japan]]</span>
				<span class='text'>When he returned, the country was in the grip of the [[panic of 1893|panic of '93]] and [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] was swept by labor unrest</span>
				<span class='text'>After grueling jobs in a [[jute mill]] and a street-railway power plant, London joined [[Kelly's Army]] and began his career as a tramp</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1894, he spent 30&amp;nbsp;days for vagrancy in the [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] Penitentiary at [[Buffalo, New York]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In ''The Road'', he wrote::{{quote |''Man-handling was merely one of the very minor unprintable horrors of the Erie County Pen</span>

				<span class='text'>'}}After many experiences as a hobo and a sailor, he returned to Oakland and attended [[Oakland High School (California)|Oakland High School]]</span>

				<span class='text'>This was the setting for some of his first successful stories</span>
				<span class='text'>London's time in the harsh [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]], however, was detrimental to his health</span>

				<span class='text'>He concluded that his only hope of escaping the work &quot;trap&quot; was to get an education and &quot;sell his brains&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He saw his writing as a business, his ticket out of poverty, and, he hoped, a means of beating the wealthy at their own game</span>

				<span class='text'>283]:&quot;SCANDAL MONGER: After God had finished making the rattlesnake, the toad and the vampire, He had some awful substance left, with which He made a scandal monger</span>
				<span class='text'>A scandal monger is a two-legged animal with a cork-screw soul, a water-sogged brain and a combination backbone made of jelly and glue</span>
				<span class='text'>Where other men have their hearts he carries a tumor of decayed principles</span>
				<span class='text'>When the scandal monger comes down the street honest men turn their backs, the angels weep tears in heaven, and the devil shuts the gates of hell to keep him out</span>
				<span class='text'>—Anon&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;This passage as given above was the subject of a 1974 Supreme Court case, ''[[Letter Carriers v</span>
				<span class='text'>Austin]]'' [[Case citation|418 U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>264]] (1974), in which Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]] referred to it as &quot;a well-known piece of trade union literature, generally attributed to author Jack London&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>A union newsletter had published a &quot;list of scabs,&quot; which was granted to be factual and therefore not libelous, but then went on to quote the passage as the &quot;definition of a scab&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>The case turned on the question of whether the &quot;definition&quot; was defamatory</span>
				<span class='text'>The court ruled that &quot;Jack London's</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>'definition of a scab' is merely rhetorical hyperbole, a lusty and imaginative expression of the contempt felt by union members towards those who refuse to join&quot;, and as such was not libelous and was protected under the First Amendment</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;thescab&quot; /&gt;Despite being frequently attributed to London, the passage does not appear at all in the extensive collection of his writings at [[Sonoma State University]]'s website</span>
				<span class='text'>However, in his book ''The War of the Classes'' he published a 1903 speech entitled &quot;The Scab&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;http://london</span>
				<span class='text'>onoma</span>
				<span class='text'>du/Writings/WarOfTheClasses/scab</span>
				<span class='text'>tml&lt;/ref&gt; which gave a much more balanced view of the topic:{{quote |To strike at a man's food and shelter is to strike at his life; and in a society organized on a tooth-and-nail basis, such an act, performed though it may be under the guise of generosity, is none the less menacing and terrible</span>
				<span class='text'>It is for this reason that a laborer is so fiercely hostile to another laborer who offers to work for less pay or longer hours</span>
				<span class='text'>To hold his place, (which is to live), he must offset this offer by another equally liberal, which is equivalent to giving away somewhat from the food and shelter he enjoys</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;br&gt;[</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;br&gt;When a striker kills with a brick the man who has taken his place, he has no sense of wrong-doing</span>
				<span class='text'>In the deepest holds of his being, though he does not reason the impulse, he has an ethical sanction</span>
				<span class='text'>He feels dimly that he has justification, just as the home-defending Boer felt, though more sharply, with each bullet he fired at the invading English</span>
				<span class='text'>Behind every brick thrown by a striker is the selfish will &quot;to live&quot; of himself, and the slightly altruistic will &quot;to live&quot; of his family</span>
				<span class='text'>The family group came into the world before the State group, and society, being still on the primitive basis of tooth and nail, the will &quot;to live&quot; of the State is not so compelling to the striker as is the will &quot;to live&quot; of his family and himself</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;br&gt;[</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;br&gt;The laborer who gives more time or strength or skill for the same wage than another, or equal time or strength or skill for a less wage, is a scab</span>
				<span class='text'>The generousness on his part is hurtful to his fellow-laborers, for it compels them to an equal generousness which is not to their liking, and which gives them less of food and shelter</span>
				<span class='text'>But a word may be said for the scab</span>
				<span class='text'>Just as his act makes his rivals compulsorily generous, so do they, by fortune of birth and training, make compulsory his act of generousness</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;br&gt;[</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>&lt;br&gt;Nobody desires to scab, to give most for least</span>
				<span class='text'>The ambition of every individual is quite the opposite, to give least for most; and, as a result, living in a tooth-and-nail society, battle royal is waged by the ambitious individuals</span>
				<span class='text'>But in its most salient aspect, that of the struggle over the division of the joint product, it is no longer a battle between individuals, but between groups of individuals</span>
				<span class='text'>Capital and labor apply themselves to raw material, make something useful out of it, add to its value, and then proceed to quarrel over the division of the added value</span>
				<span class='text'>Neither cares to give most for least</span>
				<span class='text'>Each is intent on giving less than the other and on receiving more</span>
				<span class='text'>}==== ''Might Is Right'' ====[[Anton LaVey]]'s [[Church of Satan]] claims that &quot;Ragnar Redbeard&quot;, pseudonymous author of the 1896 book ''[[Might Is Right]]'', was London</span>
				<span class='text'>No London biographers mention any such possibility</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Rodger Jacobs]] published an essay ridiculing this theory, arguing that in 1896 London was unfamiliar with philosophers heavily cited by Redbeard, such as Nietzsche, and had not even begun to develop his mature literary style</span>
