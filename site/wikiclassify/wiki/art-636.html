				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>], Ellington was based in New York City from the mid-1920s onward, and gained a national profile through his orchestra's appearances at the [[Cotton Club]] in Harlem</span>
				<span class='text'>In the 1930s, his orchestra toured in Europe</span>
				<span class='text'> Though widely considered to have been a pivotal figure in the history of jazz, Ellington embraced the phrase &quot;beyond category&quot; as a liberating principle, and referred to his music as part of the more general category of American Music, rather than to a musical genre such as jazz</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker-1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Tucker|1995|p=6}} writes &quot;He tried to avoid the word 'jazz' preferring 'Negro' or 'American' music</span>
				<span class='text'>He claimed there were only two types of music, 'good' and 'bad' </span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>And he embraced a phrase coined by his colleague [[Billy Strayhorn]] â€“ 'beyond category' â€“ as a liberating principle</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;/ref&gt;Some of the musicians who were members of Ellington's orchestra, such as saxophonist [[Johnny Hodges]], are considered to be among the best players in jazz</span>
				<span class='text'>Ellington melded them into the best-known [[orchestral jazz|orchestral]] unit in the history of jazz</span>
				<span class='text'>Some members stayed with the orchestra for several decades</span>
				<span class='text'>A master at writing miniatures for the [[Gramophone record#78 rpm recording time|three-minute 78 rpm]] recording format, Ellington often composed specifically to feature the style and skills of his individual musicians</span>
				<span class='text'>ften collaborating with others, Ellington wrote more than one thousand compositions; his extensive body of work is the largest recorded personal jazz legacy, with many of his extant works having become [[Standard (music)|standards]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Ellington also recorded songs written by his bandsmen, for example [[Juan Tizol]]'s &quot;[[Caravan (1937 song)|Caravan]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Perdido (song)|Perdido]]&quot;, which brought a [[Spanish tinge]] to big band jazz</span>
				<span class='text'>After 1941, Ellington collaborated with composer-arranger-pianist [[Billy Strayhorn]], whom he called his writing and arranging companion</span>

				<span class='text'>70</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; With Strayhorn, he composed many extended compositions, or suites, as well as additional short pieces</span>
				<span class='text'>Following an appearance at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]], in July 1956, Ellington and his orchestra enjoyed a major career revival and embarked on world tours</span>
				<span class='text'>Ellington recorded for most American record companies of his era, performed in several films, scoring several, and composed stage musicals</span>
				<span class='text'>ue to his inventive use of the orchestra, or big band, and thanks to his eloquence and charisma, Ellington is generally considered to have elevated the perception of jazz to an art form on a par with other traditional musical genres</span>
				<span class='text'>His reputation continued to rise after his death, and he was awarded a special [[Pulitzer Prize]] for music in 1999</span>

				<span class='text'>In 1919 he met drummer [[Sonny Greer]] from New Jersey, who encouraged Ellington's ambition to become a professional musician</span>
				<span class='text'>Ellington built his music business through his day job: when a customer asked him to make a sign for a dance or party, he would ask if they had musical entertainment; if not, Ellington would offer to play for the occasion</span>

				<span class='text'>He was known to play the bugle at the end of each performance</span>
				<span class='text'>The group was initially called Elmer Snowden and his Black Sox Orchestra and had seven members, including trumpeter [[James &quot;Bubber&quot; Miley]]</span>

				<span class='text'>For a short time soprano saxophonist [[Sidney Bechet]] played with them, imparting his propulsive swing and superior musicianship to the young band members</span>

				<span class='text'>After recording a handful of acoustic titles during 1924-1926, Ellington's signing with Mills allowed him to record prolifically, although sometimes he recorded different versions of the same tune</span>
				<span class='text'>Mills often took a co-composer credit</span>
				<span class='text'>From the beginning of their relationship, Mills arranged recording sessions on nearly every label including [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]], Victor, Columbia, OKeh, PathÃª (and its Perfect label), the ARC/Plaza group of labels (Oriole, Domino, Jewel, Banner) and their dime-store labels (Cameo, Lincoln, Romeo), Hit of the Week, and Columbia's cheaper labels (Harmony, Diva, Velvet Tone, Clarion) labels which gave Ellington popular recognition</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;John Bird, ''Percy Grainger''&lt;/ref&gt; Ellington's first period at the Cotton Club concluded in 1931</span>
				<span class='text'>==The early 1930s===Ellington led the orchestra by conducting from the keyboard using piano cues and visual gestures; very rarely did he conduct using a baton</span>
				<span class='text'>As a bandleader, Ellington was not a strict disciplinarian; he maintained control of his orchestra with a combination of charm, humor, flattery, and astute psychology</span>
				<span class='text'>A complex, private person, he revealed his feelings to only his closest intimates and effectively used his public persona to deflect attention away from himself </span>
				<span class='text'>llington signed exclusively to Brunswick in 1932 and stayed with them through late 1936 (albeit with a short-lived 1933-34 switch to Victor when Irving Mills temporarily moved him and his other acts from Brunswick)</span>

				<span class='text'>Sonny Greer had been providing occasional vocals and continued to do in a cross-talk feature with Anderson</span>
				<span class='text'>Radio exposure helped maintain popularity as Ellington and his orchestra began to tour</span>
				<span class='text'>The other records of this era include: &quot;[[Mood Indigo]]&quot; (1930),  &quot;[[Sophisticated Lady]]&quot; (1933), &quot;[[(In My) Solitude|Solitude]]&quot; (1934), and  &quot;[[In a Sentimental Mood]]&quot; (1935)While the band's United States audience remained mainly African-American in this period, the Ellington orchestra had a huge following overseas, exemplified by the success of their trip to England and Scotland in 1933 and their 1934 visit to the European mainland</span>
				<span class='text'>The British visit saw Ellington win praise from members of the serious music community, including composer [[Constant Lambert]], which gave a boost to Ellington's interest in composing longer works</span>
				<span class='text'>hose longer pieces had already begun to appear</span>
				<span class='text'>He had composed and recorded Creole Rhapsody as early as 1931 (issued as both sides of a 12&quot; record for Victor and both sides of a 10&quot; record for Brunswick), and a tribute to his mother, &quot;Reminiscing in Tempo&quot;, took four 10&quot; record sides to record in 1935 after her death in that year</span>
				<span class='text'>''[[Symphony in Black]]'' (also 1935), a short film, featured his extended piece 'A Rhapsody of Negro Life'</span>
				<span class='text'>It introduced [[Billie Holiday]], and won an [[Academy Award]] as the best musical short subject</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref&gt;Schuller, 1989, p</span>
				<span class='text'>4&lt;/ref&gt; Ellington and his Orchestra also appeared in the features  ''[[Murder at the Vanities]]'' and ''[[Belle of the Nineties]]'' (both 1934),For agent Mills the attention was a publicity triumph, as Ellington was now internationally known</span>
				<span class='text'>On the band's tour through the segregated South in 1934, they avoided some of the traveling difficulties of African-Americans by touring in private railcars</span>
				<span class='text'>These provided easy accommodations, dining, and storage for equipment while avoiding the indignities of segregated facilities</span>
				<span class='text'>ompetition was intensifying though, as swing bands like [[Benny Goodman]]'s, began to receive popular attention</span>
				<span class='text'>Swing dancing became a youth phenomenon, particularly with white college audiences, and danceability drove record sales and bookings</span>
				<span class='text'>[[Jukebox]]es proliferated nationwide, spreading the gospel of swing</span>
				<span class='text'>Ellington's band could certainly swing, but their strengths were mood, nuance, and richness of composition, hence his statement &quot;jazz is music, swing is business&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===The later 1930s===From 1936, Ellington began to make recordings of smaller groups (sextets, octets, and nonets) drawn from his then-15-man orchestra and he composed pieces intended to feature a specific instrumentalist, as with &quot;Jeep's Blues&quot; for [[Johnny Hodges]], &quot;Yearning for Love&quot; for [[Lawrence Brown (musician)|Lawrence Brown]], &quot;Trumpet in Spades&quot; for [[Rex Stewart]], &quot;Echoes of Harlem&quot; for [[Cootie Williams]] and &quot;Clarinet Lament&quot; for [[Barney Bigard]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1937, Ellington returned to the Cotton Club which had relocated to the mid-town [[Theater District]]</span>
				<span class='text'>In the summer of that year, his father died, and due to many expenses, Ellington's finances were tight, although his situation improved the following year</span>
				<span class='text'>fter leaving agent Irving Mills, he signed on with the [[William Morris Agency]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Mills though continued to record Ellington</span>
				<span class='text'>After only a year, his Master and Variety labels, the small groups had recorded for the latter, collapsed in late 1937, Mills placed Ellington back on Brunswick and those small group units on Vocalion through to 1940</span>
				<span class='text'>Well known sides continued to be recorded, &quot;[[Caravan (1937 song)|Caravan]]&quot; in 1937, and &quot;I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart&quot; the following year</span>

				<span class='text'>In this, he was helped by Strayhorn, who had enjoyed a more thorough training in the forms associated with [[classical music]] than Ellington</span>
				<span class='text'>The first of these, &quot;[[Black, Brown, and Beige]]&quot; (1943), was dedicated to telling the story of African-Americans, and the place of slavery and the church in their history</span>
				<span class='text'>Ellington debuted ''Black, Brown and Beige'' in [[Carnegie Hall]] on January 23, 1943, beginning an annual series of concerts there over the next four years</span>
				<span class='text'>While some jazz musicians had played at Carnegie Hall before, none had performed anything as elaborate as Ellingtonâ€™s work</span>
				<span class='text'>Unfortunately, starting a regular pattern, Ellington's longer works were generally not well received</span>
				<span class='text'> partial exception was ''Jump for Joy'', a full-length musical based on themes of African-American identity, debuted on July 10, 1941 at the [[Mayan Theater]] in Los Angeles</span>

				<span class='text'>he settlement of the [[1942-43 musicians' strike|first recording ban of 1942â€“43]], leading to an increase in royalties paid to musicians, had a serious effect on the financial viability of the big bands, including Ellington's Orchestra</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;===Early post-war years===World War II brought about a swift end to the big band era as musicians went off to serve in the military and travel restrictions made touring difficult</span>
				<span class='text'>When the war ended, the focus of popular music shifted towards crooners such as [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Jo Stafford]], so Ellington's wordless vocal feature &quot;Transblucency&quot; (1946) with [[Kay Davis]] was not going to have a similar reach</span>
				<span class='text'>With inflation setting in after 1945, the cost of hiring big bands went up and club owners preferred smaller jazz groups who played in new styles such as [[bebop]]</span>
				<span class='text'> Dancing in clubs also subjected club owners to a new wartime tax which continued for many years after, which made small bands more cost-effective for club owners</span>

				<span class='text'>n the early 1960s, Ellington embraced recording with artists who had been friendly rivals in the past, or were younger musicians who focused on later styles</span>
				<span class='text'>The Ellington and [[Count Basie]] orchestras recorded together</span>
				<span class='text'>During a period when he was between recording contracts, he made records with [[Louis Armstrong]] ([[Roulette Records|Roulette]]), [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[John Coltrane]] (both for [[Impulse! Records|Impulse]]) and participated in a session with [[Charles Mingus]] and [[Max Roach]] which produced the ''[[Money Jungle]]'' ([[United Artists Records|United Artists]]) album</span>
				<span class='text'>He signed to [[Frank Sinatra]]'s new [[Reprise Records|Reprise label]], but the association with the label was short-lived</span>
				<span class='text'>usicians who had previously worked with Ellington returned to the Orchestra as members: Lawrence Brown in 1960 and [[Cootie Williams]] in 1962</span>

				<span class='text'>As a consequence, he formed new working relationships with artists from around the world, including the Swedish vocalist [[Alice Babs]], and the South African musicians [[Abdullah Ibrahim|Dollar Brand]] and [[Sathima Bea Benjamin]] (''A Morning in Paris'', 1963/1997)</span>
				<span class='text'>llington wrote an original score for director [[Michael Langham]]'s production of Shakespeare's ''[[Timon of Athens]]'' at the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival|Stratford Festival]] in Ontario, Canada which opened on July 29, 1963</span>
				<span class='text'>Langham has used it for several subsequent productions, including a much later adaptation by Stanley Silverman which expands the score with some of Ellington's best-known works</span>
