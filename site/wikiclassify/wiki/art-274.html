				<span class='text'>The Flames' dynamic gospel-tinged vocals, polished choreography and timing as well as Brown's energetic dance moves and high-octane singing upstaged the show from proposed closing act, [[the Rolling Stones]]</span>
				<span class='text'>With a new deal with King, Brown released his composition, &quot;[[Papa's Got a Brand New Bag]]&quot;, which became his first top ten pop hit and won Brown his first [[Grammy Award]]</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=pc51/&gt; Later in 1965, Brown issued &quot;[[I Got You (I Feel Good)|I Got You]]&quot;, which became his second single in a row to reach number-one on the R&amp;B chart and top ten on the pop chart</span>
				<span class='text'>Brown followed that up with the ballad, &quot;[[It's a Man's Man's Man's World]]&quot; which confirmed his stance as a top-ranking performer, especially with R&amp;B audiences from that point on</span>

				<span class='text'>[File:James Brown 1972 Tampa</span>
				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|Brown after a concert in [[Tampa]] on January 29, 1972]]Changes in Brown's style that started with &quot;Cold Sweat&quot; also established the musical foundation for Brown's later hits, such as &quot;[[I Got the Feelin']]&quot; (1968) and &quot;[[Mother Popcorn]]&quot; (1969)</span>
				<span class='text'>By this time Brown's vocals frequently took the form of a kind of rhythmic declamation, not quite sung but not quite spoken, that only intermittently featured traces of [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] or [[melody]]</span>
				<span class='text'>This would become a major influence on the techniques of [[rapping]], which would come to maturity along with [[hip hop music]] in the coming decades</span>
				<span class='text'>Brown's style of funk in the late 1960s was based on interlocking syncopated parts: funky bass lines, drum patterns, and iconic guitar riffs</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; The main guitar ostinatos for &quot;[[Ain't It Funky]]&quot; and &quot;[[Give It Up or Turn It Loose]]&quot; (both 1969), are examples of Brown's refinement of New Orleans funk; irresistibly danceable riffs, stripped down to their rhythmic essence</span>
				<span class='text'>On both recordings the tonal structure is bare bones</span>
				<span class='text'>The pattern of attack-points is the emphasis, not the pattern of pitches</span>
				<span class='text'>It's as if the guitar is an African drum, or idiophone</span>
				<span class='text'>Alexander Stewart states that this popular feel was passed along from &quot;New Orleans—through James Brown's music, to the popular music of the 1970s</span>

				<span class='text'>In fact, on a 1976 version, Cuban bongos are used</span>
				<span class='text'>All three of these guitar riffs are based on an onbeat/offbeat structure</span>
				<span class='text'>Stewart states: &quot;This model, it should be noted, is different from a [[bell pattern|time line]] (such as [[clave (rhythm)|clave]] and [[tresillo (rhythm)|tresillo]]) in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle</span>
				<span class='text'>quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart (2000: 306)</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;It was around this time as the musician's popularity increased that he acquired the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|nickname]], &quot;Soul Brother No</span>

				<span class='text'>He was noted for his ability as a [[bandleader]] and songwriter to blend the simplicity and drive of R&amp;B with the rhythmic complexity and precision of [[jazz]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Trumpeter Lewis Hamlin and saxophonist/keyboardist [[Alfred &quot;Pee Wee&quot; Ellis]] (the successor to previous bandleader Nat Jones) led the band</span>
				<span class='text'>Guitarist [[Jimmy Nolen]] provided percussive, deceptively simple [[riff]]s for each song, and [[Maceo Parker]]'s prominent saxophone solos provided a focal point for many performances</span>
				<span class='text'>Other members of Brown's band included stalwart Famous Flames singer and sideman Bobby Byrd, drummers [[John &quot;Jabo&quot; Starks]], [[Clyde Stubblefield]] and [[Melvin Parker]], saxophonist [[St</span>
				<span class='text'>Clair Pinckney]], trombonist [[Fred Wesley]], guitarist Alphonso &quot;Country&quot; Kellum and bassist [[Bernard Odum]]</span>
				<span class='text'>n addition to a torrent of singles and studio albums, Brown's output during this period included two more successful live albums, ''[[Live at the Garden (James Brown album)|Live at the Garden]]'' (1967) and ''[[Live at the Apollo, Volume II]]'' (1968), and a 1968 television special, ''[[James Brown: Man to Man]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>His music empire expanded along with his influence on the music scene</span>
				<span class='text'>As Brown's music empire grew, his desire for financial and artistic independence grew as well</span>
				<span class='text'>Brown bought radio stations during the late 1960s, including [[WCHZ (AM)|WRDW]] in his native Augusta, where he shined shoes as a boy</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=pc51&gt;{{Pop Chronicles|51|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1967, James Brown purchased radio station WGYW in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] for a reported $75,000, according to the January 20, 1968 ''[[Record World]]'' magazine</span>
				<span class='text'>The call letters were changed to WJBE reflecting his initials</span>
				<span class='text'>WJBE began on January 15, 1968 and broadcast a Rhythm &amp; Blues format</span>

				<span class='text'>]Brown branched out to make several recordings with musicians outside his own band</span>
				<span class='text'>In an attempt to appeal to the older, more affluent, and predominantly white [[adult contemporary]] audience, Brown recorded ''Gettin' Down To It'' (1969) and ''[[Soul on Top]]'' (1970)--two albums consisting mostly of romantic ballads, jazz standards, and homologous reinterpretations of his earlier hits—with the Dee Felice Trio and the [[Louie Bellson]] Orchestra</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1968, he recorded a number of funk-oriented tracks with [[The Dapps]], a white [[Cincinnati]] band, including the hit &quot;[[I Can't Stand Myself (When You Touch Me)|I Can't Stand Myself]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>He also released three albums of [[Christmas music]] with his own band</span>

				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>s}}In March 1970, most of Brown's mid-to-late 1960s road band walked out on him due to money disputes, a development augured by the prior disbandment of The Famous Flames singing group for the same reason in 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>Brown and erstwhile Famous Flames singer Bobby Byrd (who chose to remain in the band during this tumultuous period) subsequently recruited several members of the Cincinnati-based [[The Pacemakers (funk band)|The Pacemakers]], which included [[Bootsy Collins]] and his brother [[Catfish Collins|Phelps &quot;Catfish&quot; Collins]]; augmented by the remaining members of the 1960s road band (including Fred Wesley, who rejoined Brown's outfit in December 1970) and other newer musicians, they would form the nucleus of [[The J</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>s]], Brown's new backing ensemble</span>
				<span class='text'>Shortly following their first performance together, the band entered the studio to record the Brown-Byrd composition, &quot;[[Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine]]&quot;; the song and other contemporaneous singles would further cement Brown's influence in the nascent genre of funk music</span>
				<span class='text'>This iteration of the J</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>s dissolved after a March 1971 European tour (documented on the 1991 archival release ''[[Love Power Peace]]'') due to additional money disputes and Bootsy Collins' use of [[LSD]]; the Collins brothers would soon become integral members of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]], while a new lineup of the J</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>s coalesced around Wesley, St</span>
				<span class='text'>Clair Pinckney, and drummer John Starks</span>
				<span class='text'>n 1971, Brown began recording for [[Polydor Records]] which also took over distribution of Brown's King Records catalog</span>
				<span class='text'>Many of his sidemen and supporting players, including Andre Beeka, Fred Wesley &amp; the J</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>s, Bobby Byrd, [[Lyn Collins]], [[Vicki Anderson]] and former rival [[Hank Ballard]], released records on the [[People Records|People]] label, an imprint founded by Brown that was purchased by Polydor as part of Brown's new contract</span>
				<span class='text'>The recordings on the People label, almost all of which were produced by Brown himself, exemplified his &quot;house style&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Songs such as &quot;[[I Know You Got Soul (Bobby Byrd song)|I Know You Got Soul]]&quot; by Bobby Byrd, &quot;[[Think (About It)|Think]]&quot; by Lyn Collins and &quot;[[Doing It to Death]]&quot; by Fred Wesley &amp; the J</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>s are considered as much a part of Brown's recorded legacy as the recordings released under his own name</span>
				<span class='text'>That year, he also began touring African countries and was received well by audiences there</span>

				<span class='text'>James Brown: The Godfather of Soul (New York: Macmillan Publishing Company,1986), 233&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Brown's record sales and concerts in the United States reached a lull in 1973 as he failed to land a number-one R&amp;B single that year</span>
				<span class='text'>Brown relied more on touring outside the United States where he continued to perform for sold-out crowds in cities such as London, Paris and [[Lausanne, Switzerland|Lausanne]]</span>
				<span class='text'>That year, Brown also faced problems with the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] for failure to pay [[back taxes]], charging he hadn't paid upwards of $4</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;jbencyclopedia&quot; /&gt;In 1973, Brown provided the score for the [[blaxploitation]] film ''[[Black Caesar (film)|Black Caesar]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>He also recorded another soundtrack for the film, ''[[Slaughter's Big Rip-Off]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>Following the release of these soundtracks, Brown acquired a self-styled nickname, &quot;The Godfather of Soul&quot;, which remains his most popular nickname</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1974, he returned to the No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 spot on the R&amp;B charts with &quot;[[The Payback (song)|The Payback]]&quot;, with the [[The Payback|parent album]] reaching the same spot on the album charts; he would reach No</span>
				<span class='text'>1 two more times in 1974 including &quot;[[My Thang]]&quot; and &quot;[[Papa Don't Take No Mess]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Later that year, he returned to Africa and performed in [[Kinshasa]] as part of the buildup to [[The Rumble in the Jungle]] fight between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[George Foreman]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Admirers of Brown's music, including [[Miles Davis]] and other jazz musicians, began to cite Brown as a major influence on their own styles</span>
				<span class='text'>However, Brown, like others who were influenced by his music, also &quot;borrowed&quot; from other musicians</span>
				<span class='text'>His 1976 single &quot;[[Hot (I Need to Be Loved, Loved, Loved)|Hot (I Need To Be Loved, Loved, Loved, Loved)]]&quot; (R&amp;B #31) used the main [[riff]] from &quot;[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]&quot; by [[David Bowie]], not the other way around as was often believed</span>
				<span class='text'>The riff was provided to &quot;Fame&quot; co-writers [[John Lennon]] and Bowie by guitarist [[Carlos Alomar]], who had briefly been a member of Brown's band in the late 1960s</span>

				<span class='text'>Among his top ten R&amp;B hits during this latter period included &quot;[[Funky President (People It's Bad)|Funky President]]&quot; and &quot;[[Get Up Offa That Thing]]&quot;, the latter song released in 1976 and aimed at musical rivals such as [[Barry White]], [[The Ohio Players]] and [[K</span>

				<span class='text'>Brown credited his then-second wife and two of their children as writers of the song to avoid concurrent tax problems with the IRS</span>
				<span class='text'>Starting in October 1975, Brown produced, directed, and hosted ''[[Future Shock (TV series)|Future Shock]]'', an Atlanta-based television variety show that ran for three years</span>
				<span class='text'>==1975–91: Decline and resurgence===Although his records were mainstays of the vanguard New York underground [[disco]] scene exemplified by DJs such as [[David Mancuso]] and [[Francis Grasso]] from 1969 onwards, Brown did not consciously yield to the trend until 1975's ''[[Sex Machine Today]]''</span>
				<span class='text'>By 1977, he was no longer a dominant force in R&amp;B</span>
				<span class='text'>After &quot;Get Up Offa That Thing&quot;, thirteen of Brown's late 1970s recordings for Polydor failed to reach the Top 10 of the R&amp;B chart, with only &quot;[[Bodyheat]]&quot; in 1976 and the disco-oriented &quot;[[It's Too Funky in Here]]&quot; in 1979 reaching the R&amp;B Top 15 and the ballad &quot;[[Kiss in '77]]&quot; reaching the Top 20</span>
				<span class='text'>After 1976's &quot;Bodyheat&quot;, he also failed to appear on the Billboard Hot 100</span>
				<span class='text'>As a result, Brown's concert attendance began dropping and reported disputes with the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] caused Brown's empire to collapse</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, Brown's former band mates, including Fred Wesley, Maceo Parker and the Collins brothers, had found bigger success as members of [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]'s [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] collective</span>
				<span class='text'>The emergence of disco also stopped Brown's success on the R&amp;B charts as its slicker commercial style had superseded his rawer funk productions</span>
				<span class='text'>y the release of 1979's ''The Original Disco Man'', Brown was not providing much production or writing, leaving most of it to producer [[Brad Shapiro]], resulting in the song &quot;It's Too Funky in Here&quot; becoming Brown's most successful single in this period</span>
				<span class='text'>After two more albums failed to chart, Brown left Polydor in 1981</span>
				<span class='text'>It was around this time that Brown changed the name of his band from the J</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>s to the Soul Generals (or Soul G's)</span>
				<span class='text'>This band's name remained that way until his death</span>
				<span class='text'>Despite a decline in record sales, Brown enjoyed something of a resurgence in this period starting with appearances in the feature films ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', ''[[Doctor Detroit]]'' and ''[[Rocky IV]]'', as well as guest starring in the ''[[Miami Vice]]'' episode &quot;Missing Hours&quot; (1987)</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1984, Brown teamed with rap musician [[Afrika Bambaattaa]] on the song &quot;[[Unity (Afrika Bambaataa and James Brown song)|Unity]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>A year later he signed with [[Scotti Brothers Records]] and issued the moderately successful album, ''[[Gravity (James Brown album)|Gravity]]'', in 1986</span>
				<span class='text'>It included Brown's final Top 10 pop hit, &quot;[[Living in America (James Brown song)|Living in America]]&quot;, marking his first Top 40 entry since 1974 and his first Top 10 pop entry since 1968</span>
				<span class='text'>Produced and written by [[Dan Hartman]], it was also featured prominently on the ''[[Rocky IV]]'' film and soundtrack</span>

				<span class='text'>quot; 1986 also saw the publication of Brown's autobiography, ''James Brown: The Godfather of Soul'', co-written with Bruce Tucker</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1987, Brown won the Grammy for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance for &quot;Living in America&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>pg|thumb|143px|right|Brown and MC Danny Ray during cape routine, BBC Electric Proms '06 concert]]James Brown's performances were famous for their intensity and length</span>
				<span class='text'>His own stated goal was to &quot;give people more than what they came for&amp;nbsp;— make them tired, 'cause ''that's'' what they came for</span>
				<span class='text'>&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Guralnick, 231</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt; Brown's concert repertoire consisted mostly of his own hits and recent songs, with a few R&amp;B [[Cover version|covers]] mixed in</span>
				<span class='text'>Brown danced vigorously as he sang, working popular dance steps such as the [[Mashed Potato (dance)|Mashed Potato]] into his routine along with dramatic leaps, splits and slides</span>
				<span class='text'>In addition, his horn players and backup singers (The Famous Flames) typically performed choreographed dance routines, and later incarnations of the Revue included backup dancers</span>
				<span class='text'>Male performers in the Revue were required to wear [[Tuxedo (clothing)|tuxedoes]] and [[cummerbund]]s long after more casual concert wear became the norm among the younger musical acts</span>
				<span class='text'>Brown's own extravagant outfits and his elaborate [[Conk|processed hairdo]] completed the visual impression</span>
				<span class='text'>A James Brown concert typically included a performance by a featured vocalist, such as Vicki Anderson or [[Marva Whitney]], and an instrumental feature for the band, which sometimes served as the opening act for the show</span>
				<span class='text'>==Cape routine===A trademark feature of Brown's stage shows, usually during the song &quot;Please, Please, Please&quot;, involved Brown dropping to his knees while clutching the microphone stand in his hands, prompting the show's longtime MC, Danny Ray, to come out, drape a cape over Brown's shoulders and escort him off the stage after he had worked himself to [[exhaustion]] during his performance</span>
				<span class='text'>As Brown was escorted off the stage by the MC, Brown's vocal group, [[The Famous Flames]], continued singing the background vocals &quot;Please, please don't go-oh-oh&quot;</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;Brown's demands of his support acts were, however, quite the reverse</span>
				<span class='text'>As [[Fred Wesley]] recalled of his time as musical director of the JBs, if Brown felt intimidated by a support act he would try to &quot;undermine their performances by shortening their sets without notice, demanding that they not do certain showstopping songs, and even insisting on doing the unthinkable, playing drums on some of their songs</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;/ref&gt;==Social activism=====Education advocacy and humanitarianism===Brown's main social activism was in preserving the need for education among youths, influenced by his own troubled childhood and his forced dropping out of the seventh grade for wearing &quot;insufficient clothes&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Due to heavy [[dropping out|dropout]] rates in the 1960s, Brown released the pro-education song, &quot;[[Don't Be a Drop-Out]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>Royalties of the song were donated to charity used for dropout prevention programs</span>
				<span class='text'>The success of this led to Brown meeting with President [[Lyndon B</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson]] at the [[White House]]</span>
				<span class='text'>Johnson cited Brown for being a positive role model to the youth</span>
				<span class='text'>After the assassination of Dr</span>
				<span class='text'>Martin Luther King, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee, Brown provided a free city-wide concert in Boston to maintain public order (over the objections of the police chief, who wanted to call off the concert, which he thought would incite violence)</span>
				<span class='text'>A lifelong Republican like his best friend, Ray Charles, James Brown gained the confidence of President Richard Nixon, to whom he found he had to explain the plight of Black Americans</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;YouTube|MBKz8pDNuto&quot;&gt;{{YouTube|MBKz8pDNuto}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown's outspoken support of President Nixon and the Republican Party in the election of 1972 led groups such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the NAACP and the National Urban League to launch a nationwide boycott of his businesses, at a time when Brown was the most successful Black entrepreneur in America (below)</span>
				<span class='text'>He was also harassed by J</span>
				<span class='text'>Edgar Hoover and the IRS, probably because Hoover thought it &quot;dangerous&quot; that a young &quot;Black radical&quot; had the ear of the president</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=&quot;YouTube|MBKz8pDNuto&quot;/&gt;Throughout the remainder of his life, Brown made public speeches in schools and continued to advocate the importance of education in school</span>
				<span class='text'>Upon filing his will in 2002, Brown advised that most of the money in his estate go into creating the I Feel Good, Inc</span>
				<span class='text'>Trust to benefit disadvantaged children and provide scholarships for his grandchildren</span>
				<span class='text'>His final single, &quot;Killing Is Out, School Is In&quot;, advocated against murders of young children in the streets</span>
				<span class='text'>Brown often gave out money and other items to children while traveling to his childhood hometown of Augusta</span>
				<span class='text'>A week before his death, while looking gravely ill, Brown gave out toys and turkeys to kids at an Atlanta orphanage, something he had done several times over the years</span>
				<span class='text'>==Civil rights and self-reliance===Though Brown performed at benefit rallies for [[civil rights]] organizations in the mid-1960s, Brown often shied away from discussing civil rights in his songs</span>
				<span class='text'>In 1968, in response to a growing urge of [[Opposition to the U</span>
				<span class='text'></span>
				<span class='text'>involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war advocacy during the Vietnam War]], Brown recorded the song, &quot;[[America Is My Home]]&quot;</span>
				<span class='text'>In the song, Brown performed a [[rapping|rap]], advocating patriotism and exhorting listeners to &quot;stop pitying yoursel[ves] and get up and fight</span>
				<span class='text'>quot; At the time of the song's release, Brown had been participating in performing for troops stationed in Vietnam</span>
				<span class='text'>A day after the [[assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr</span>
				<span class='text'>], Brown gave out a televised concert at the [[Boston Garden]] to calm concerned Boston relatives</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=pc51/&gt; The show was later released on DVD as ''[[Live at the Boston Garden: April 5, 1968]]''</span>

				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=vh1nightjbsavedbos/&gt; Angered by not being told of this, Brown demanded $60,000 for &quot;gate&quot; fees (money he thought would be lost from ticket sales on account of the concert being broadcast for free) and then threatened to go public about the secret arrangement when the city balked at paying up afterwards, news of which would have been a political death blow to White and spark riots of its own</span>
				<span class='text'>lt;ref name=vh1nightjbsavedbos/&gt; White eventually lobbied the behind-the-scenes power-brokering group known as &quot;The Vault&quot; to come up with money for Brown's gate fee and other social programs, contributing $100,000</span>
				<span class='text'>Brown received $15,000 from them via the city</span>

				<span class='text'>People called &quot;Black and Proud&quot; militant and angry – maybe because of the line about dying on your feet instead of living on your knees</span>
				<span class='text'>But really, if you listen to it, it sounds like a children's song</span>
				<span class='text'>That's why I had children in it, so children who heard it could grow up feeling pride</span>

				<span class='text'>The song cost me a lot of my crossover audience</span>
