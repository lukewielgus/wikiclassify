The '''Academy Awards''', or &quot;'''Oscars'''&quot;, is an annual [[United States of America|American]] awards ceremony honoring cinematic achievements in the [[film industry]]. The various category winners are awarded a copy of a statuette, officially called the Academy Award of Merit, which has become commonly known by its nickname &quot;Oscar&quot;. The awards, first presented in 1929 at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]], are overseen by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS).&lt;ref&gt; = About the Academy Awards |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate = 13 April 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070407234926/http://www.oscars.org/aboutacademyawards/index.html |archivedate = 7 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birth of Oscar | first=Andrew | last=Essex | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=14 May 1999 | accessdate=2 March 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111215005/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273341,00.html | archivedate=2013-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The awards ceremony was first televised in 1953, and is now seen live in more than 200 countries.&lt;ref&gt;rds/academyawards/about/history.html|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=13 January 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uKhyVna9|archivedate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oscars is the oldest entertainment awards ceremony; its equivalents, the [[Emmy Award]]s for television, the [[Tony Award]]s for theatre, and the [[Grammy Award]]s for music and recording, are modeled after the Academy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;up.co.uk/#!los-angeles/c1drk|website=platinumagencygroup.co.uk|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[86th Academy Awards]] ceremony was held on March 2, 2014, at the [[Dolby Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]], later than usual as to not clash with the [[Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]], Russia.&lt;ref&gt;lash|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-rt-film-oscars2014l2n0ch1d5-20130325,0,4480470.story|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=25 March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401213550/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-rt-film-oscars2014l2n0ch1d5-20130325,0,4480470.story|archivedate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[87th Academy Awards]] ceremony was held on February 22, 2015. Historically given during the first quarter of the new year, the awards honor achievements for cinematic accomplishments for the preceding year. For example, ''[[12 Years a Slave (film)|12 Years a Slave]]'' was awarded Best Picture for 2013, although the Oscar ceremony was conducted in 2014. As of the 87th awards ceremony, held in 2015, a total of 2,947 Oscars have been awarded since the inception of the award.&lt;ref&gt;work=Oscars.org - Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[first Academy Awards]] presentation was held on May 16, 1929, at a private dinner at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]] with an audience of about 270 people. The post-awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;|title=History of the Academy Awards|work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uKhyVna9|archivedate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1929|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} dollars).{{Inflation-fn|US}} Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927–28 period. The ceremony ran for 15&amp;nbsp;minutes.

Winners had been announced to media three months earlier; however, that was changed for the second ceremony in 1930. Since then, for the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00&amp;nbsp;pm on the night of the awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; This method was used until an occasion when the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has, since 1941, used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

The first Best Actor awarded was [[Emil Jannings]], for his performances in ''[[The Last Command (1928 film)|The Last Command]]'' and ''[[The Way of All Flesh (1927 film)|The Way of All Flesh]]''. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, the winners were recognized for all of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and [[Janet Gaynor]] later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. With the fourth ceremony, however, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

At the 29th ceremony, held on March 27, 1957, the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] category was introduced. Until then, foreign-language films had been honored with the Special Achievement Award.

The 74th Academy Awards, held in 2002, presented the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

==Oscar statuette==

Although there are seven other types of annual awards presented by the Academy (the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]], the [[Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award]], the [[Gordon E. Sawyer Award]], the [[Academy Scientific and Technical Award]], the [[Academy Award for Technical Achievement]], the [[John A. Bonner Medal of Commendation]] and the [[Student Academy Award]]) plus two awards that are not presented annually (the Special Achievement Award in the form of an Oscar statuette and the Honorary Award that may or may not be in the form of an Oscar statuette), the best known one is the ''Academy Award of Merit'' more popularly known as the Oscar statuette. Made of gold-plated [[britannia metal|britannium]] on a black metal base, it is 13.5&amp;nbsp;in (34&amp;nbsp;cm) tall, weighs 8.5&amp;nbsp;lb (3.85&amp;nbsp;kg) and depicts a knight rendered in [[Art Deco]] style holding a [[crusades|crusader's]] sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes. The five spokes represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.&lt;ref&gt;r.html/?pn=statuette|title= Oscar Statuette: Legacy|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 13 April 2007|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172055/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/about/awards/oscar.html/?pn=statuette|archivedate= 2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No model was used during the design process of the statuette.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oscars.org/oscars/statuette|title = Oscar Statuette|date = |accessdate = 2015-03-16|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sculptor [[George Stanley (sculptor)|George Stanley]] (who also did the Muse Fountain&lt;ref&gt;Fountain| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722114340/http://www.hollywoodbowl.com:80/about/history.cfm| archivedate=2010-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]) sculpted Cedric Gibbons's design in clay and Sachin Smith cast the statuette in 92.5 percent [[tin]] and 7.5 percent copper and then gold-plated it{{Citation needed|date = March 2015}}. The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the [[C.W. Shumway &amp; Sons]] Foundry in [[Batavia, Illinois]], which also contributed to casting the molds for the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] and [[Emmy Award]]s statuettes. Since 1983,&lt;ref&gt;14| title=Eladio Gonzalez sands and buffs Oscar #3453| work=Boston Globe| date=20 February 2009| accessdate=21 February 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090223085458/http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2009/02/at_work.html| archivedate= 23 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 50 Oscars are made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer [[R.S.

===Naming===

The origin of the name ''Oscar'' is disputed. One biography of [[Bette Davis]] claims that she named the Oscar after her first husband, band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson;&lt;ref&gt;ography|publisher=The Internet Movie Database|accessdate = 13 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070308152931/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000012/bio| archivedate= 8 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the earliest mentions in print of the term ''Oscar'' dates back to a [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] article about the 1934 [[6th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;00.html | work=Time | title=Cinema: Oscars | date=26 March 1934| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813182253/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,747239,00.html | archivedate=2013-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Walt Disney]] is also quoted as thanking the Academy for his Oscar as early as 1932.&lt;ref&gt;tle= Oscar®-Winning Walt|publisher=Disney.Go.com|accessdate = 25 February 2012|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130116193800/http://d23.disney.go.com/news/2010/03/oscar-winning-walt/|archivedate= 2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another claimed origin is that the Academy's Executive Secretary, [[Margaret Herrick]], first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuette's reminding her of her &quot;Uncle Oscar&quot; (a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Oscar&quot; in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', June 2008 Draft Revision.&lt;/ref&gt; Columnist Sidney Skolsky was present during Herrick's naming and seized the name in his byline, &quot;Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette 'Oscar'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;ory and Politics of the Academy Awards| year = 2003| publisher = Burns &amp; Oates| isbn = 978-0-8264-1452-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trophy was officially dubbed the &quot;Oscar&quot; in 1939 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

===Engraving===
To prevent information identifying the Oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony, Oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates. Until 2010, winners were expected to return the statuettes to the Academy after the ceremony and wait several weeks to have inscriptions applied. Since 2010, winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription-processing station at the Governor's Ball, a party held immediately after the Oscar ceremony. In 2010, the R.S. Owens company made 197 engraved nameplates ahead of the ceremony, bearing the names of every potential winner. The 175 or so nameplates for non-winning nominees were recycled afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Ownership of Oscar statuettes===
Since 1950, the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US$1. If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums.&lt;ref&gt;(Levy 2003, pg 28)&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2011, [[Orson Welles]]' 1941 Oscar for ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' ([[Best Original Screenplay]]) was put up for auction, after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;ndex.html|title = Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane' Oscar for sale|publisher = CNN|first = Alan|last = Duke|date = December 12, 2011|accessdate = December 12, 2011|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131112025602/http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/12/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html|archivedate = 2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 2011, it sold in an online auction for US$861,542.&lt;ref name=&quot;Welles' Oscar sold&quot;&gt;p://www.cnn.com/2011/12/21/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html|accessdate=April 7, 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=December 21, 2011|author=Duke, Alan|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116121806/http://www.cnn.com/2011/12/21/showbiz/orson-welles-oscar/index.html|archivedate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, [[Harold Russell]] needed money for his wife's medical expenses. In a controversial decision, he consigned his 1946 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' to Herman Darvick Autograph Auctions, and on August 6, 1992, in [[New York City]], the Oscar sold to a private collector for $60,500. Russell defended his action, saying, &quot;I don't know why anybody would be critical. My wife's health is much more important than sentimental reasons. The movie will be here, even if Oscar isn't.&quot; Harold Russell is the only Academy Award winning actor to ever sell an Oscar.

While the Oscar is owned by the recipient, it is essentially not on the open market.&lt;ref&gt;l|title = Psst!

Although some Oscar sales transactions have been successful, some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy, which keeps them in its treasury.&lt;ref&gt;(Levy 2003, pg 29)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomination==
Since 2004, Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in late January. Prior to that, the results were announced in early February.

===Voters===
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of 5,783 {{as of|lc=y|2012}}.&lt;ref&gt;n | url=http://news.aol.com/entertainment/story/_a/oscars-contingency-plan/20080130161309990001 | work=AOL News | date=30 January 2008 | accessdate=19 March 2008| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20090203061252/http://news.aol.com/entertainment/story/_a/oscars-contingency-plan/20080130161309990001| archivedate= 3 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academy membership is divided into different branches, with each representing a different discipline in film production. Actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academy's composition. Votes have been certified by the auditing firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] (and its predecessor [[Price Waterhouse]]) for the past 73 annual awards ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt; = The men who are counting on Oscar|publisher=BBC News|author=Jackie Finlay|date=3 March 2006|accessdate =13 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070319204536/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4769730.stm| archivedate= 19 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures.

New membership proposals are considered annually. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members. While the membership had been growing, stricter policies have kept its size steady since then.&lt;ref&gt;l|title = Academy Invites 115 to Become Members|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate = 4 September 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070827031611/http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2007/07.06.18.html  |archivedate = 27 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the results of a study conducted by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately 88% of AMPAS' voting membership. Of the 5,100+ active voters confirmed, 94% were Caucasian, 77% were male, and 54% were found to be over the age of 60. 33% of voting members are former nominees (14%) and winners (19%).&lt;ref&gt;latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/academy/la-et-unmasking-oscar-academy-project-html,0,7473284.htmlstory|accessdate=15 October 2013|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=Feb 19, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307133844/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/academy/la-et-unmasking-oscar-academy-project-html,0,7473284.htmlstory|archivedate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the Academy sent a letter advising its 6,000 or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting will be implemented in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;-voting-comes-to-the-oscars-finally | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Cieply | title=Electronic Voting Comes to The Oscars (Finally) | date=23 May 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105075132/http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/23/electronic-voting-comes-to-the-oscars-finally/ | archivedate=2014-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rules===
According to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of 1 January to midnight at the end of 31 December, in [[Los Angeles County, California]] and play for seven consecutive days, to qualify (except for the Best Foreign Language Film).&lt;ref&gt;ml

Rule 2 states that a film must be feature-length, defined as a minimum of 40&amp;nbsp;minutes, except for short subject awards, and it must exist either on a [[35 mm film|35 mm]] or [[70 mm film]] print or in 24&amp;nbsp;frame/s or 48&amp;nbsp;frame/s [[progressive scan]] [[digital cinema]] format with a minimum projector resolution of 2048 by 1080 pixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oscars.org/sites/default/files/87aa_rules.pdf|title = Academy Award Rules|date = |accessdate = 2015-03-17|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline, the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year. The form includes the production credits for all related categories. Then, each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases.

In late December ballots and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6,000 active members. For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories (i.e. only directors vote for directors, writers for writers, actors for actors, etc.). In all major categories, voters use an [[Instant-runoff voting|instant run-off voting]] ballot, with potential nominees rewarded in the [[single transferable vote]] tally for having strong supporters who rank them first.&lt;ref&gt;g-for-oscar.html|title = With choice voting for Oscar nominations, passion wins|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140108020452/http://oscarvotes123.blogspot.com/2011/01/with-choice-voting-for-oscar.html|archivedate = 2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are some exceptions in the case of certain categories, like Foreign Film, Documentary and Animated Feature Film, in which movies are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches. In the special case of Best Picture, all voting members are eligible to select the nominees for that category. Foreign films must include English subtitles, and each country can submit only one film per year.&lt;ref&gt;academy-and-its-oscar-awards

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories, including Best Picture.&lt;ref&gt;ml

Film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for Best Picture, in attempts to improve chances of receiving Oscars and other movie awards conferred in [[Oscar season]]. The Academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified. It has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders.&lt;ref&gt;tics|first=Robert |last=Marich  |publisher=[[Southern Illinois University Press]] |edition=3rd|year=2013 |pages=235–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a producer of the 2010 Best Picture nominee, ''[[The Hurt Locker]],'' was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as front-runner (''The Hurt Locker'' eventually won).

The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, most commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. [[Black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast).

The Academy Awards is the only awards show that is televised live in all United States time zones (excluding Hawaii; they aired live in [[Alaska]] starting in 2011 for the first time since 1996), Canada, the United Kingdom, and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;le=International Broadcasters from Oscars.com|publisher=Oscars.com| archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20090225132125/http://www.oscar.com/oscarnight/?pn=internationalbroadcasters |archivedate= 25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 ceremony was watched by more than 40 million Americans.&lt;ref&gt;sen – Press Release: The Nielsen Company's 2008 Guide to the Academy Awards |publisher=Nielsen.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213062344/http://www.nielsen.com/media/2008/pr_080221a.html|archivedate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other awards ceremonies (such as the Emmys, Golden Globes, and [[Grammy Award|Grammys]]) are broadcast live in the Eastern &amp; Central time zones, but are on [[Broadcast delay|tape delay]] on the West Coast and might not air the same day outside North America (if the awards are even televised). The Academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally, but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sources.
The Awards show was first televised in 1953, on [[NBC]], which continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Network took over, televising the festivities (including the first color broadcast of the event in 1966) through 1970, after which NBC resumed the broadcasts. ABC once again took over broadcast duties in 1976 and it is under contract to do so through the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;10224b.html|title= ABC and Academy Extend Oscar Telecast Agreement|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences

By 1954, seven other countries, namely Brazil, Cuba, Venezuela, West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and France, were already broadcasting the Awards show, although previously filmed into a condensed 60-minute version, called the &quot;International Edition&quot; of the Academy Awards. The Awards show was broadcast for the first time via satellite in 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil purchased the rights to air the live event. By that time, the television rights to the Awards show were sold in 50 countries. A decade later, the TV rights to the Oscars were already being sold to 60 countries, and by 1984, the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries. Until the arrival of subscription television in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, which enabled the Oscars to be broadcast live through these territories, there was already available a previously filmed or taped 90-minute version of the Awards show which was aired on broadcast television in these territories. However, several Asian and Australasian countries, such as Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand were already carrying the live broadcast of the Awards show since the late 1970s. AMPAS still produces a condensed 90-minute version of the Academy Awards for those territories in which the rights to the live broadcast are expensive.

After more than 60 years of being held in late March or early April, the ceremonies were moved up to late February or early March starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with [[Oscar season]] in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[sweeps]] period. Some years, the ceremony is moved into early March in deference to the [[Winter Olympics]]. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of [[Passover]] and [[Easter]], which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public. Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most [[Emmys]] in history, with 47 wins and 195 nominations.&lt;ref&gt;s-love-for-oscars-continues-with-12-nominations.html|title = Emmys love for Oscars continues with 12 nominations

After many years of being held on Mondays at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]]/6:00 p.m [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]], in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm Eastern/5:30&amp;nbsp;pm Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;scar-night.html|title = TV Notes; Moving Oscar Night|work=The New York Times |author=Bill Carter|date= 8 April 1998|accessdate = 8 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304185231/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/08/movies/tv-notes-moving-oscar-night.html|archivedate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19980701&amp;id=-CsiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eqYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6637,43314 Academy Awards will move to Sunday night] Reading Eagle – 1 July 1998; From ''Google News Archive''&lt;/ref&gt; For many years the film industry had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1980&amp;dat=19990319&amp;id=sKEiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=laoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1224,4570799 Never Say Never: Academy Awards move to Sunday] The Item – 19 March 1999.

Originally scheduled for April 8, 1968, the [[40th Academy Awards]] ceremony was postponed for two days, because of the assassination of [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]]. On March 30, 1981, the [[53rd Academy Awards]] was postponed for one day, after [[Reagan assassination attempt|the shooting]] of President [[Ronald Reagan]] and others in [[Washington, D.C.]]

In 1993, an ''In Memoriam'' segment was introduced,&lt;ref name=&quot;fawcett&quot;&gt;cett|title=Farrah Fawcett:Oscars director apologises for 'In Memoriam' omission|work=The Guardian |accessdate=8 March 2010 | location=London | first=Ben | last=Child | date=10 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100414020632/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/mar/10/oscars-farrah-fawcett| archivedate= 14 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months, a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members.&lt;ref&gt;uching to watch, painful to make |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/movieawards/oscars/2010-03-03-oscar-memorial-segment_N.htm|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=USA Today |date=3 March 2010|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names. Criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect, with the segment having a &quot;[[popularity contest]]&quot; feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subject's cultural impact; the applause has since been muted during the telecast, and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead.

In terms of broadcast length, the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours. The first Oscars, in 1929, lasted 15&amp;nbsp;minutes. At the other end of the spectrum, the 2000 ceremony lasted four hours and four minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Ehbar, Ned (February 28, 2014). &quot;Did you know?&quot; ''Metro''. New York City. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the organizers of the Academy Awards announced that winners' [[Oscar speech|acceptance speeches]] must not run past 45&amp;nbsp;seconds. This, according to organizer Bill Mechanic, was to ensure the elimination of what he termed &quot;the single most hated thing on the show&quot; – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion.&lt;ref&gt;-speeches-cut | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Cut … all change at Oscars as winners are given just 45&amp;nbsp;seconds to say thanks | first=Sam | last=Jones | date=16 February 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128143126/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/feb/16/oscar-winners-speeches-cut | archivedate=2011-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy has contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into January, citing TV viewers' fatigue with the film industry's long awards season. However, such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail). Also, a January ceremony would have to compete with [[National Football League]] playoff games.&lt;ref&gt;t-oscars-20101005|title = Academy looks to move 2012 Oscar ceremony up several weeks

==Awards ceremonies==
{{main|List of Academy Awards ceremonies}}

Historically, the &quot;Oscarcast&quot; has pulled in a bigger haul when box-office hits are favored to win the Best Picture trophy. More than 57.25 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the [[70th Academy Awards]] in 1998, the year of ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', which generated close to US$600 million at the North American box office pre-Oscars.&lt;ref&gt;04196530_oscarads23.html | work=The Seattle Times | title=Academy's red carpet big stage for advertisers | first=Meg | last=James | date=23 February 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117115833/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004196530_oscarads23.html | archivedate=2011-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[76th Academy Awards]] ceremony in which ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (pre-telecast box office earnings of US$368 million) received 11 Awards including Best Picture drew 43.56 million viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday_oscar&quot;&gt;5-01-26-oscar-telecast_x.htm|work=USA Today |title=Oscars lack blockbuster to lure TV viewers | date=26 January 2005 | first=Scott | last=Bowles | accessdate=8 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most watched ceremony based on [[Nielsen ratings]] to date, however, was the [[42nd Academy Awards]] (Best Picture ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'') which drew a 43.4% household rating on 7 April 1970.&lt;ref&gt;out=chart_pass&amp;charttype=chart_topshowsalltime |title=Charts and Data: Top 100 TV Shows of All Time by '&amp;#39;Variety'&amp;#39; |publisher=Variety.com |date=2002-10-09 |accessdate=2014-02-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118083655/http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=chart_pass&amp;charttype=chart_topshowsalltime |archivedate=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings. The [[78th Academy Awards]] which awarded low-budgeted, independent film ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (with a pre-Oscar gross of US$53.4 million) generated an audience of 38.64 million with a household rating of 22.91%.&lt;ref&gt;elsen-analysis_x.htm | title=Low Ratings ''Crash'' Party |work=USA Today | first=Gary | last=Levin | date=7 March 2006 | accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the [[80th Academy Awards]] telecast was watched by 31.76 million viewers on average with an 18.66% household rating, the lowest rated and least watched ceremony to date, in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;80227/LIFE/802270307 | title=Oscar ratings worst ever |work=The Washington Post |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330005242/http://www.capecodonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080227/LIFE/802270307 |archivedate=2014-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independently financed film (''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'').

In 1929, the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]]. From 1930 to 1943, the ceremony alternated between two venues: the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] on [[Wilshire Boulevard]] and the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Biltmore Hotel]] in downtown Los Angeles.

[[TCL Chinese Theatre|Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946, followed by the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948. The [[21st Academy Awards]] in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theatre at what was the Academy's headquarters on [[Melrose Avenue]] in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;e = Oscars Award Venues

From 1950 to 1960, the awards were presented at Hollywood's [[Pantages Theatre (Hollywood)|Pantages Theatre]]. With the advent of television, the awards from 1953 to 1957 took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York, first at the [[Majestic Theatre (Columbus Circle)|NBC International Theatre]] (1953) and then at the [[New Century Theatre|NBC Century Theatre]], after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles. The Oscars moved to the [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]] in [[Santa Monica, California]] in 1961. By 1969, the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Los Angeles, this time to the [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]] at the [[Los Angeles Music Center|Los Angeles County Music Center]].

In 2002, the Kodak Theatre (now known as the [[Dolby Theatre]]) became the current venue of the presentation.&lt;ref&gt;.com/8301-505245_162-57425417/oscars-home-renamed-dolby-theatre/ |publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=May 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502081049/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57425417/oscars-home-renamed-dolby-theatre/ |archivedate=2 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first year of the awards, the Best Directing award was split into two separate categories (Drama and Comedy). At times, the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories (Drama and Comedy/Musical). From the 1930s through the 1960s, the Art Direction (now Production Design), Cinematography, and Costume Design awards were likewise split into two separate categories (black-and-white films and color films). Prior to 2012, the Production Design award was called Art Direction, while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup.

Another award, entitled the [[Academy Award for Best Original Musical]], is still in the Academy rulebooks and has yet to be discontinued. However, due to continuous insufficient eligibility each year, it has not been awarded since 1984 (when ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]]'' won).&lt;ref&gt;|title=Music Awards &amp;#124; Rules for the 84th Academy Awards &amp;#124; Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences |publisher=Oscars.org |date=2012-08-24 |accessdate=2014-02-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211172058/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/rule16.html |archivedate=2013-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Accusations of commercialism===
Due to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards, studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the &quot;[[Oscar season]]&quot;. This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing than quality. No independent films have received the award (though a few were nominated), and no actors working outside of the studio system for a picture have won the award for their work in that picture.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} [[William Friedkin]], an Academy Award-winning film director and former producer of the ceremony, expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009, describing it as &quot;the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;title=Director William Friedkin at the Hudson Union Society |url=http://fora.tv/2009/02/24/Director_William_Friedkin_at_the_Hudson_Union_Society#William_Friedkin_Says_Oscars_Simply_a_Promotion_Scheme |accessdate=11 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090310081013/http://fora.tv/2009/02/24/Director_William_Friedkin_at_the_Hudson_Union_Society| archivedate= 10 March 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Dirks, editor of [[American Movie Classics|AMC's]] [[filmsite.org]], has written of the Academy Awards,

{{quote|Unfortunately, the critical worth, artistic vision, cultural influence and innovative qualities of many films are not given the same voting weight. Especially since the 1980s, moneymaking &quot;formula-made&quot; blockbusters with glossy production values have often been crowd-pleasing titans (and Best Picture winners), but they haven't necessarily been great films with depth or critical acclaim by any measure.&lt;ref&gt; The Oscars |accessdate=4 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120093333/http://www.filmsite.org/oscars.html|archivedate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Accusations of bias===
{{main|Oscar bait}}
Typical criticism of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over-representation of romantic historical epics, biographical dramas, romantic dramedies, and family melodramas, most of which are released in the U.S. the last three months of the calendar year. The Oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded. From 1927 to 2001 around 49% of Best Picture nominated films had been categorized as a drama and out of the 432 films to be analyzed within that time 47% of the winning films were in fact dramas.&lt;ref&gt;he Oscars |accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the coining of the term '[[Oscar bait]]', describing such movies. This has led at times to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience, e.g. by favoring 'Oscar bait' over audience favorites, or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues.&lt;ref&gt;_jumped_the_shark_LLhBrvPY35EnSH0iQzrqRJ |title=Have the Oscars jumped the shark? |accessdate=24 January 2012 | work=New York Post |first=Kyle |last=Smith|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418115808/http://www.nypost.com:80/p/entertainment/movies/have_the_oscars_jumped_the_shark_LLhBrvPY35EnSH0iQzrqRJ |archivedate=2012-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism or sentimentalization===
Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for sentimental reasons,&lt;ref&gt;|title=Taylor, Elizabeth |accessdate=4 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; personal popularity,&lt;ref&gt;Actor choice of all time? |accessdate=4 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115115957/http://incontention.com/?p=1045|archivedate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; atonement for past mistakes,&lt;ref&gt; Oscar voter *doesn't* mean never having to say you're sorry - Los Angeles Times |accessdate=4 October 2009 | publisher=BennyLabamba.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310184453/http://bennylabamba.com/being-an-oscar-voter |archivedate=2014-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or presented as a &quot;career honor&quot; to recognize a distinguished nominee's entire body of work.&lt;ref&gt;ory and politics of the Academy Awards – The Career Oscars| url = https://books.google.com/?id=dH2Lb_YhIhAC&amp;pg=PA268| accessdate = 4 October 2009| year = 2003| publisher = Burns &amp; Oates| isbn = 978-0-8264-1452-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refusing the award===
Some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars. The first to do so was [[Dudley Nichols]] (Best Writing in 1935 for ''[[The Informer (1935 film)|The Informer]]''). Nichols boycotted the [[8th Academy Awards]] ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers' Guild.&lt;ref name=&quot;DYK&quot;&gt;he Oscars Did You Know?|accessdate=18 June 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090623000022/http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp| archivedate= 23 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George C. Scott]] became the second person to refuse his award (Best Actor in 1970 for ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'') at the [[43rd Academy Awards]] ceremony. Scott described it as a 'meat parade', saying 'I don't want any part of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;her=BBC News | title=George C Scott: The man who refused an Oscar | date=23 September 1999| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311095900/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/obituaries/455563.stm | archivedate=2014-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;00.html | work=Time | title=Show Business: Meat Parade | date=8 March 1971| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221203341/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904789,00.html | archivedate=2008-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fast Facts – Did You Know? |publisher=Biography.com |date=16 May 1929 |accessdate=6 February 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100210075430/http://www.biography.com/oscars/oscars_didyouknow.jsp| archivedate= 10 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third was [[Marlon Brando]], who refused his award (Best Actor for 1972's ''[[The Godfather]]''), citing the film industry's discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans. At the [[45th Academy Awards]] ceremony, Brando sent [[Sacheen Littlefeather]] to read a 15-page speech detailing his criticisms.&lt;ref name=DYK/&gt;

==Presenter and performer gifts==
It has become a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the Oscars. In recent years these gifts have also been extended to award nominees and winners.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABCGiftBag&quot;&gt;?|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=86683|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=11 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425162335/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=86683|archivedate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of each of these gift bags can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars. In 2014 the value was reported to be as high as US$80,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSGiftBag&quot;&gt; of swag|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/oscars-gift-bag-has-80000-worth-of-swag/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=11 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305230143/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/oscars-gift-bag-has-80000-worth-of-swag/|archivedate=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value has risen to the point where the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status.&lt;ref name=&quot;IRSGiftBag&quot;&gt;w.irs.gov/uac/IRS-Statement-on-Oscar-Goodie-Bags|publisher=IRS.gov|accessdate=11 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311093138/http://www.irs.gov/uac/IRS-Statement-on-Oscar-Goodie-Bags|archivedate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Oscar gift bags have included vacation packages to Hawaii and Mexico and Japan, a private dinner party for the recipient and friends at a restaurant, [[videophone]]s, a four-night stay at a hotel. Watches, bracelets, vacation packages, spa treatments, bottles of vodka, maple salad dressing, and weight-loss gummie candy.&lt;ref name=ABCGiftBag/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ABCGiftBag2&quot;&gt;de the 2014 Oscar Nominees' Gift Bags|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/surprising-freebies-inside-2014-oscar-nominees-gift-bags/story?id=22518285|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=11 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311095026/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/surprising-freebies-inside-2014-oscar-nominees-gift-bags/story?id=22518285|archivedate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VarietyGiftBag&quot;&gt; with Distinctive Assets Gift Bags|url=http://variety.com/2014/film/news/oscar-losers-become-winners-with-distinctive-assets-gift-bags-1201100762/|publisher=Variety|accessdate=11 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311095625/http://variety.com/2014/film/news/oscar-losers-become-winners-with-distinctive-assets-gift-bags-1201100762/|archivedate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the gifts have even had a &quot;risque&quot; element to them; in 2014 the adult products retailer [[Adam &amp; Eve (company)|Adam &amp; Eve]] had a &quot;Secret Room Gifting Suite&quot;. Celebrities visiting the gifting suite included [[Judith Hoag]], [[Carolyn Hennesy]], [[Kate Linder]], [[Chris Mulkey]], [[Jim O'Heir]], and [[NBA]] player [[John Salley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AandEOscarGifts&quot;&gt; Oscars' Celebs|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/novelty/Adam-Eve-Had-Secret-Room-Gifting-Suite-for-Oscars-Celebs-551833.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=11 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311092632/http://business.avn.com/articles/novelty/Adam-Eve-Had-Secret-Room-Gifting-Suite-for-Oscars-Celebs-551833.html|archivedate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
